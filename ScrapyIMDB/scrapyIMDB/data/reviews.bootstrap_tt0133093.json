A lot of thought provoking\nmaterial, and some interesting subtleties. I've seen it 10 times (I don't\nusually watch a movie more than once), and I'll watch it a few more. \nEnjoy!\n"},

But as you get more into the movie you\nrealize\nthat behind the action scenes and special effects there is an engaging and\nintelligent plot driving the entire movie.  While not all viewers would\nenjoy this, I think that everyone should at least give this movie a try.\nIt\nis not to be missed.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nMake sure you don't talk.  If you talk, you won't get it.  Don't watch all\nthese comedies and expect to get it the first time.  Dig deep and think\nabstract.  I liked it.  It will have you saying stuff like\n\"cool.\"\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis movie will certainly remain my favorite for quite some time.  The\naction and movie affects are engrossing, and it will be the standard other\nmovies are compared against for at least a decade.  The story was\ncreative,\nthe acting was supurb, and overall I can't think of a single\nflaw.<br><br>Great movie!  Buy the DVD and watch it over and over.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nFantastic movie that really only works when your sound system is excellent.\nI've watched this one at least ten times, and the difference in the\nexperience is remarkable.  I've never known a movie to hinge so much on its\nsound quality.\nBeautifully, hypnotically photographed, in a comic book storyboard style.\nKeanu is surrounded by top notch actors, and he rocks as Neo.  So what if\nthe philosophy here is half-baked New Ageism; suspend your Critic and Listen\nto this fun action feast.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI want not 2 but 9 sequels just like Star Wars. It can be done.  Keanu\nReeves best movie since Speed and Devil's Advocate. Lawrence Fishburne is\ngood and Carrie Ann Moss is absolutely stunning. The action sequences are\namazing and set a new bench mark for future movies.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nAnd, wow!  Just as I was surfing the IMDb site, I wondered: \"What IS the\nstatus for 'The Matrix 2'? And about the third, as well... Where are they\nfilming? Where....\"<br><br>And low and behold... it came to me.  What if this whack-ass Matrix mindtrip\nis only three to an enormous 9-episode venture similar to (HELLO!!!) 'Star\nWars'!<br><br>My God!  Do you have any idea how insane that would be.  Okay, just a\nthought.  Go back to your life now.<br><br>Love,<br><br>Comm Major\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis is the best movie I have ever seen!!  Keanu Reeves did an awesome job,\nbut not quite as awesome as Lawrence Fishbourne.  The plot is eerily\npossible, and it makes you think about the world that we live in.  Who\nknows, we might actually live in something similar to the matrix.  If you\nhave not seen this movie, I recommend that you do!\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThe movie had all the elements of great science fiction and action and\nbreathed fresh life into an almost stale genre.  While over long and not\nplaying as well on video it has an originality which is lacking from most\nbig\nbudget films.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nBecause I agree with the positive comments about this film, I'm not even\ngonna go there except to chime in about it being one of the best films I've\never seen.  What struck me was Hugo Weaving's range.  After seeing \"Bedrooms\nand Hallways\" I can't even believe it's the same guy.  Everything about him\nis different.  His voice, his carriage.  I know that's why they call it\nacting, but Agent Smith is a huge departure from anything else I've seen him\nin.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nA computer hacker attempts to destroy a seemingly invincible artificial\nintelligence that is controlling human life.  Potentially intelligent,\nphilosophical plot and some fine supporting acting sunk by comic book\nscript, undeveloped main character and excessive special effects. (Rating:\nB)\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThe first time I watched the Matrix i did not think it was anything special,\nbut upon watching it a second time i realised just how good both the\nstoryline and the special effects are.<br><br>After watching the film you start to wonder and then it starts to mess with\nyour head.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nAn example of science-fiction movie based on philosophy and deep thought.\nGreat visual effects, great performances. A movie to see more and more. If\nyou have a personal idea of virtual reality and parallel histories, well\n\"The Matrix\" will help you to find something you didn't\nknow.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nGets better every time I watch it.  A mind boggling concept behind the\nplot.\nSometimes I think about it and get the shivers.   Some of the action\nscenes\nare already classics for their originality and are being duplicated in\nother\nshows, TV and movies.  My favorite Keanu movie. \n"},
{"review": "\n\nAs far as the genre is considered this is the all time single most\nbeautiful\npiece of Art ever captured on film. The acting I wouldn't consider to be\nthe greatest of our time but the vibe and the overall message was by far\nthe\nmost wonderful visual feast I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. What\na\nbrilliant movie by The W Bros. these guys kick serious !@!@#@$! Also a\nmust\nsee is the movie \"Bound\" if you like anything by The W\nBros.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nWhen I went to the movies to watch The Matrix I admit that I wasn't\nexpecting for a good movie at all but when it started I realized how wrong\nI\nwas. This movie is great! It depicts in a very interesting way how the\nhuman\nbeing is living nowadays. Certainly, one of the best sci-fi movies\never!\n"},
{"review": "\n\nWhat will people say 50 years from now about the Matrix??\nThey'll call it a classic.  It's already a classic now.\nFrom start to finish, it's a joyride of bullet dodging, mind-bending, a$$\nkickin' special effects with the perfect people for the part.  I can't\nwait\nfor the sequels.  The Matrix trilogy will surely be the \"Star Wars\" of the\ncomputer generation.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nFor you, who haven\u00b4t seen this one, i must say:\nThis is one of the worst movies in the nineties, together with Lost World\nand Wild Wild West...\nOkay, the action scenes is nice, but the acting, the plot is really really\nAWFUL...\n"},
{"review": "\n\nIf you go into this film with no expectations then this film is visually\nTHE\nBEST I'VE EVER SEEN. Keanu Reeves kicks butt bigtime.<br><br>However the plot is a bit twisted, I wont spoil it for everyone, but the\nmatrix is a really creepy idea.<br><br>Nevertheless, if when you go to the cinema you want to see \"goodies\"\nbeating\n\"baddies\" this film won't disappoint. \n"},
{"review": "\n\nIf you have not seen \"The Matrix\" you must.  Keanu Reeves is hot.  The\nspecial effects are totally awesome.  There are plenty of guns.  The plot\nwill make you question the reality of reality.  Absolutely a must see!!!\nMy\nfavorite movie by far!\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis movie is awesome. Not once do you get bored... you just fly through\nit,\nand at the end you look back and say \"WOW! This movie is sweet!\" And then,\nyou never sleep for 5 nights because you are thinking about the Matrix...\nand about what the Oracle said to Neo!<br><br>I really believe this movie is the best sci-fi movie ever... better than\nstar wars for sure.<br><br>\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI loved this movie from the first time i saw it. Very nice music, and\nmind-blowing special effects. Superb plot. Besides, it has Keanu Reeves in\nit, which automatically makes it awesome. If the sequels are half as good\nas\nthe original, I'll be first in line at the theater. I give it a 2-thumbs\nup!\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis film is a must watch for anyone interested in cyberpunk.  A movie that\ngets live-action anime onto film.  Some of the best martial arts fights\never.  And they are even more amazing when you know that the actors are\ndoing all the fighting themselves.  Go see this movie at all\ncosts.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThought provoking with fast paced martial arts action.  Every time I watch\nthis movie I find something new I hadn't seen before.  One of my favorite\nmovies.  At the end of this movie you'll either be thinking \"Woah!\" or\n\"What\nthe....?!\"\n"},
{"review": "\n\nWay cool movie.  I saw it two days ago with my best friend.  She<br><br>was raving it was so neat.  So I watched it.  I discovered, man,<br><br>was she right!  I liked Switch and Trinity.  Morpheous was<br><br>pretty cool too.  I've never seen any other Keanu Reaves movies<br><br>so I can't comment on him.  Definately a find.  Definate\n10\n"},
{"review": "\n\nULTRA COOL ACTION through the movie. Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne are\ngood, good plot.Great action, ok actors, very good special effects...hellofa\nmovie! 8.75/10 and not a point more! This movie is good but not great.\nEVERYONE should see it atleast once! I really wait for\nsequels.\n"}
