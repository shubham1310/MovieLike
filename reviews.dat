Yet another Jar Jar Abrams abortion When I saw what the idiot Abrams did to Star Trek, I was furious. When I learned that he was going to direct the latest Star Wars movie, I knew exactly what would be the result; a total abortion of a great franchise, just as he did Star Trek. Abrams once again shows his true colors by exploiting the work of someone else, and then totally destroying it. Abrams philosophy is "All we have to do is take the original movie, change a few character names, and then put it up as a new GREAT IDEA." Sorry, it doesn't work this time.  In a horrible rip off of the first Star Wars movie that premiered in 1977, Abrams takes EVERY plot idea, relies on Disney marketing to hype the movie to death, and then delivers a total failure of a movie complete with horrible actors (Harrison Ford is the exception) and trying to rely on effects to say, "Hey, look what I can do!" A few highlights: CAUTION: MAJOR SPOILER ALERT, however Abrams spoiled the movie before I wrote this review. During a storm trooper invasion a map was hidden in R2 Rolie Polie and pursued by the bad guys. During a storm trooper invasion, plans were hidden in R2-D2 and pursued by the bad guys.

A group of rebel forces flies down a trench in order to shoot at the death star's weakness and destroy it. R2-D2 and 3PO had NO meaning in the movie at all. Their appearances were only there to be able to say that they've been in all Star Wars movies Luke Skywalker finally shows up at the end of the movie, which was the obsession of the stupid plot, only to say NOTHING, but stare at the girl attempting to hand him his light saber. The movie ended before we heard the phrase, "I am your father." I would have vomited all over the theater floor if this had come about. Why people hire, support or even give J.J. Abrams any kind of recognition is beyond me. He's a horrible director and total thief of classic work. This time however, he can't blame his stupidity on an "alternate time line" as he tried miserably in Star Trek.JJ Abrams needs to quit Just awful is all I can say. A sanitation storm trooper,, who was at a invasion? A sanitation storm trooper who knows how to sword fight? Just clueless. I did not like this at all, my children did not like this, my grandma did not like this, Time lines seem to not fit, we got a old princess lea, but the technology hasn't been improved, or the old craft has not been upgraded to new technology. The found the falcon on a junk planet, but yet it's fully operational after 40 years, do they have eternal power sources, i don't think so. The end of the show was even more worthless, Luke was on what appears to be earth? and on a island in the middle of the ocean with no food or water or shelter. lololmao. Things must be getting pretty desperate in Lollywood for them to be pumping out this garbage.Disney's Hype Wars Won. Star Wars Did Not - A Safe Corporate Exercise In Entertainment. Following the mass-marketing campaign extraordinaire, I truly was fooled into believing this was a fantastic movie before I saw it. I believed the hype, that this was a Star Wars returned to form.....It is not!  Story-wise it falls short of the prequels, never mind the original films. It truly is a Disney Star Wars. It's an almost sickeningly safe corporate exercise in entertainment with none of the original edge &amp; flare/excitement. The original was based on old Saturday morning swash-buckling matinée series, with heroes &amp; beautiful heroines. This Star Wars gave us a flat-chested car mechanic who looks like a teenage choirboy, a ham-acting ex-storm-trooper &amp; Princess Leia re-imagined as a General. It's just soulless &amp; flat &amp; scared of its own shadow!  Basically they've taken the original story, sucked all the sexiness out of it &amp; punched &amp; squeezed it into a corporate 'Disney' box. All stories must have accessibility, they must allow you to buy into the imaginings &amp; in this 'The Force Awakens' fails miserably as it has hacked clumsily away at the origin story to suit its new safe Disney Star Wars universe. Booo!This trash makes no sense They forced Star Wars to return and as much as any film it makes no sense. Last we saw Star Wars the rebels won. No one bothered to tell director JJ Abrams. They are now rebels again. Luke is hiding and doesn't want to be found (but left a map behind anyway har har), but why? Don't think about it because there is no answer. Bad acting, bad or no characters and typical remake problems. Just the choice of JJ Abrams shows you what Disney intended to do: take money and return deliver less than zero. IMDB, why can't we give a zero?Here is a joke: JJ Abrams! This huckster is the shining example of all that is wrong with Hollywood. Zero talent, zero entertainment value, zero creativity and definitely no artistic integrity. Actually if he ever reads this interview he will laugh out loud. He thinks all these concepts are dated. All he cares about is cash and remaking and rebooting. No wonder he is either called Mr Rip off or Jar Jar Abrams. He and Disney fit one another.  RIP Star Wars.A virtual scene by scene steal of episode IV but without the originality Some say that there are only three original stories, some say five and some say seven. In the case of the Star Wars franchise this is patently NOT true; instead we get the same old story churned out seven times in seven progressively worse parodies of what was, in it's day, an original film. In this new version we have a somewhat badly drawn and remarkably underwhelming universe in which a bunch of hardly memorable characters set out to recreate a simple rewrite of most of episode IV - but with somewhat better special effects. To say that you could see what was coming from scene one is understating the utter predictability of the story, but perhaps Mr Abrams decided that predictability would magically make the characters readily recognisable, thereby eliminating the need for character development. This lack of character depth made it impossible to engage with them in any memorable way, it also made the romantic interest very uninteresting and highly unbelievable. Although it is a somewhat cringe-worthy production, it is just about watchable.Cover version This movie was like one of those tribute bands playing cover versions on the nostalgia circuit. You feel as if you have seen and heard the original and much better version and this is just a replica and a fake. Why would be surprised though? Disney is famed for having no talent. How many versions of, Hunchback Of Notre Dame, Captain America, Bambi, etc etc. has this company churned out? Yup, so why should they now start to create something new or exciting now? To make matters worse, the cash hounds did not notice that: No one can magically master the force in a day... No one can simply scan the cosmos and find a space ship just like that (er, space is like er you know kinda big place) The troopers are clones and are all alike so no one cannot be black and just for fun here is another one: on a raid and assault to retrieve plans (see I told you it is a rip off) you do not take a sewage cleaner soldier with you... Fine, you got the leading girl, the black trooper and the cute robot (now available at authorized dealers, outlets and websites for purchase...costing you $$ even though they are Made in China and cost 3 cents to produce) but for me four things come to mind: I am boycotting Disney going forward. That is right, you can call it Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar whatever I am out. I am boycotting JJ 'Master Hack' Abrams and producers Tommy Harper and Ben Rosenblatt going forward for being money hungry dream destroying douches and finally will never ever again trust the media and reviewers again. You are all exposed as frauds.Didn't expect much, was still disappointed. This movie was exactly what I expected it to be. A safe, unimaginative, nostalgia-filled cash grab. I cant exactly blame Disney or Abrams for taking the safe route after the backlash Lucas got for attempting to do something new, but I was still surprised at exactly how safe they decided to stay. Nearly everything is a rehash of episode 4. Same plot, same characters, same factions, even another death star. There is a painful lack of exposition. Nothing is explained about the state of the galaxy or what happened after episode 6. The viewer is not told what the New Republic is, not told what the First Order is, what the motivations of either party are, who Rey is or why she so good at everything. I know this is the first in a new trilogy, but that doesn't excuse bad writing in this movie. There is zero world building. Even the musical score is lackluster, something I figured for impossible in a Star Wars movie. For all the hate he gets, Lucas was a master world builder. I genuinely enjoyed the machinations of Palpatine within the Senate, the political scheming of the trade federation, and the build up to the start of the Clone Wars. It made the Star Wars universe seem so real seeing a functioning government and the power struggles within it. Abrams' entry in the series is devoid of all of that context. And the lesser for it. I was seriously surprised at the lack of criticism the is movie received in the days and weeks after its release. Star Wars fans ripped into every. single. little. flaw. in the prequels, yet this movie was getting a pass on major deficiencies. I even went out to see it two more times just to make sure I wasn't missing any hidden dialogue or bits of exposition. Nope.  Even now, nearly a year after its release, its still being called the best Star Wars movie by many people. I don't understand it. Star Wars is supposed to be a fantasy series, and maybe I'm wrong, but world building and exposition are supposed to be important parts of fantasy writing. How the movie with arguably the least exposition and world building is being hailed as the best is beyond me. Bottom line: This a decent action movie, but a sub par Star Wars movie.The IMDb rating is mighty fishy... I wouldn't have taken the time nor the effort to post a written review of this movie were it not for the suspiciously inflated IMDb score of 8.5. Curious, I scrolled through the first 20 PAGES of reviews and counted exactly 5 positive ones. The many negative reviews gave it one star explicitly to balance out the ridiculous score it now has overall.  I will do the same and I urge everyone else who gave it 5 stars or less to amend your review and give it a one star rating instead. The IMDb books are cooked. I'm not a conspiratorial person by nature but with so much money at stake I have to believe that the House of Mouse might have had something to do with it.  At any rate I would honestly rate it a 6 out of 10. But my sense of fair play bids me give it only one star.A Cinematic Travesty I will never forget seeing Star Wars Episode IV for the first time in 1977. What an awesome film it was. I've been a fan of the Star Wars universe ever since. It was with great excitement I watched the latest episode VII. As usual the movie began with the scrolling text laying out the current scenario. Already at this point it seemed a bit weak and very similar to previous plots. It did not take long to begin predicting what would happen in many of the scenes. I often blurted out to my family, "don't tell me they're going to copy that scene from (insert scene from other episode) here." My wife would say "Oh no, they would do that." They did! I was able to predict events and even dialogue nearly verbatim because the movie continually reused the twists and turns of previous installments. My wife who is also a Star Wars fan agreed wholeheartedly with my ho-hum reaction. Our son (also a fan) left less than 30 minutes in. I won't go into all the details of how the movie stole so much from the previous films as you can surely read them in other reviews. I wanted so much to enjoy and love this movie as I did all the others, but honestly it was boring. Whereas I've watched each of the previous Star Wars films numerous times, I seriously doubt I will ever waste two hours watching this one again. I can't imagine how it was possible to take such a fantastic imaginative story like Star Wars and make it this boring. How is it possible that not one new idea sprang up in someones mind in the ten years since the last episode? There was no character development to speak of either. I really can't think of one takeaway from this film that would be beneficial to watching any future episode either. Dull, unimaginative, and boring best describes the movie. I'm a little upset that more was not done with the opportunity to add to such a brilliant legacy. I'm not sure what JJ. Abrams was thinking and I can't understand how George Lucas allowed this cinematic travesty.  I have never been so disappointed in a movie before. Edited to add: I have now gone and read some of the other reviews here. It seems that EVERY review I saw is rated 1 out of 10 with the odd 4 or 5, so how is it possible this movie has an 8.3 average??? Something smells odd here.Disney Sponsored Fan Fiction. The Force Awakens Is A Disgraceful Example Of Corporate Filmmaking. For those praising this film,  Star Wars Episode 7 is a despicable corporate product of a movie, that leeches off the imagination of the man who created its universe, while simultaneously giving him a giant middle finger by erasing all remnants of his Prequel Trilogy and turning the franchise into a vehicle for pandering fan service and a "progressive", feminist agenda.  Episode 7 is nothing but glorified fan fiction made by a corporation desperate to get a return on their investment. With years of careful risk-benefit analysis, they were able to produce a film that upset the least amount of the rabid, vicious "original fan base" as possible. So "fans", you got everything you wanted. George Lucas, and the prequels are but a memory and you get all your original toys back, with just enough new crap to fool you into thinking your experiencing something fresh. You'll see the next 20 Star Wars movies and you'll get everything you begged to have, but you'll never be surprised.  When Lucas wrote the script for A New Hope, he wasn't trying to please anyone but himself. He wasn't feeding a hungry mob everything they wanted, he was crafting a story that he wanted to see told on film. After 6 great chapters, he finished his story. So enjoy Disney's Star Wars movies until the end of time, but just remember that you're never going to see a film series so daring, ambitious, and above all, entertaining as George Lucas' Star Wars.  Now, onto the aspects of this travesty that I fundamentally stand against. 1. A Star Wars Movie Without George Lucas Is Not Star Wars  George Lucas didn't just have a part in the making of Star Wars, he CREATED it. Star Wars wasn't a collaboration that incorporated the imaginations of many different people. It wasn't an adaptation of someone else's work. Star Wars is solely the product of one man's imagination. Sure, tons of people worked on the films, but the entire Star Wars universe is George Lucas' vision. The uniqueness of Star Wars is that it all comes from the mind of one, incredibly creative man. Episodes 1-6 are the official Star Wars story as told by the man who created it. Any other story is, by definition, an imitation. Lucasfilm can try all they like to make these new movies look and feel like the real deal, but the truth of the matter is, they will never be the genuine article. Lucas' quirky touch is what makes Star Wars special. Without it, it's just another disposable sci-fi franchise.  2. Every Decision Was Made By A Corporation.   The Force Awakens is a focus-grouped, market researched, PRODUCT that reeks of corporate control. After acquiring Lucasfilm, Disney had this film made so they would make their money back and then some. Storytelling was absolutely secondary. And the conception of the film isn't the only glaringly obvious corporate decision in Episode 7. EVERY major decision in the film was overseen by Disney and Lucasfilm. The new characters in particular reek of corporate greed and agenda pushing. The main character is a female and the secondary characters are mostly played by women or minorities. Disney will champion these casting decisions as a progressive triumph, but the truth of the matter is that these new characters exist purely as a PR move. Congratulations, your SJW street cred is through the roof, but I will never support a movie that uses someone else's creation as a platform to help their brand.   3. It Panders To A Vocal Minority Of "Fans" It absolutely sickens me that this movie deliberately ignores and actively mocks the prequels. George Lucas spent 10 years of his life crafting those films, and millions of people loved them, but the executives at Lucasfilm and Disney were so afraid of the pathetic internet trolls that they became one themselves. All the marketing of "The movie you've been waiting for since 1983!", "It's all real!", "The magic is back!"... it's all a ploy to appease a vocal minority of sad losers that couldn't stand that Episodes 1,2, and 3 tried new things. Even the title of the movie is a shot at the prequels. "The Force Awakens", as if those 3 massively popular movies somehow put the force to sleep. Once again, all of these decisions are corporate based. As a result, we get a two hour apology tour. They hear people complain about dialogue, so everyone becomes an over-acting spunk machine. They hear people complain about politics, so they ax that aspect entirely. Basically, they hear people complain about the prequels, so they do everything possible to remove them from memory. "We hate George Lucas and the prequels too, see?" Because the vocal minority of whiners is more important than the majority of people who love Lucas' entire saga. It's almost shocking how disrespectful Lucasfilm has been to prequel fans and Lucas himself. Almost.  4. This Is A Troubling Sign Of Things To Come.   The Force Awakens ushers in an era of prostitution for the Star Wars name. With Episode 7, Disney has learned that they can make whatever they want, and as long they do exactly what the "fans" tell them, they'll have a cash cow that never dries up, and they'll never have anyone complain. After all, fans are getting everything they want, right? Well what about those of us that want to see NEW things? These corporations don't care about us. New ideas could upset people, so innovation loses over imitation. The Star Wars story ended in 2005. It's time for something new. Boycott the rest of Disney's Star Wars fan-fiction, and maybe we can prevent Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens from being the movie that killed the blockbuster. An abomination I put the spoiler alert... but there is little to spoil here. It's just something that should never have been filmed. It's my fault, a friend of mine warned me. And I remember I didn't care, "it's Star Wars, I even enjoyed the I, II, III... When I see the logo and the music starts... they should really try very hard to ruin it for me. What can they do so bad?" Well... They destroy everything Star Wars was about: The Force as a mystical thing? Now it's just "superpowers", and you don't need to train. You have them, that's all. And even a spoiled brat with daddy issues has, sometimes, more powers than Yoda or Palpatine... Of course, only sometimes. Sense? None. They go for a map to find a guy that run away (and for some reason left a map???) and the reason is... is... why is that important to find him? Specially when there is a new Death Star to be destroyed? No reason at all. Because it's Luke. That's it. Dark side vs Light side? Now, the "new heroin" beats the bad guy without any training, because she's really angry. I guess, in some place, Palpatine was laughing "yes, use your anger"... But in this new Star Wars is OK, she has superpowers, that's all. You don't need calm to control the Force and, in fact, it's the bad guy who gets tempted by the light side... WTH??????? Consistency with TRotJ? If the Rebels won, shouldn't the "bad guys" be the new "rebels"? No, they are pretty much the Empire. What happened? Why? Don't expect any answer in the flick. Somebody told me it's supposed to be explained somewhere. I don't care. If you need web pages or books just to explain the main plot of a movie, that movie is really bad storytelling. Period. Great villains? (Vader, Maul, Palpatine...) Now the villain is a kid with anger control and daddy issues, some pathetic little kid not even stormtroopers respect. They give them more "superpowers" than Yoda and Palpatine together, they made him kill the most iconic Star Wars character, just to try to make him look bad-ass... And yet, you just want to ask him for him lunch money. Just pathetic. The character and the effort of Abrams to make him charismatic. The first time we saw Vader he just walked, looked around... and we knew you shouldn't mess with him. No need for superpowers. That's called being "charismatic". This guy is the new Jar Jar, but worst. Jar Jar wasn't meant to be scary. And stupid. The poor guy wants to be like Vader... The same Vader that saved the day at the end of the OT and ended up being a good guy???? That Vader???? Adventures? as we already know the plot of the movie... not so much. Great settings? A desert. Woodlands. That's all. Even if you didn't like the episodes I, II, III, you have things to enjoy: Naboo, Coruscant... Here... NOTHING. No new design to awe you. TIES, X- Wings... that's all. The Galaxy just got really, really small. The first minutes, with the Star Destroyers in the desert, are OK. The rest... I could only thing "please, I really want this to end already". It felt like a 10 hour movie to me. The only thing OK was Solo and we all know how that ended... My brain just couldn't understand why the Star Wars music was in this B-Rate bad pilot for a TV series. And the worst of all, when it ended... The silence in the cinema. And i felt... dirty, but emotionally flat. I don't feel anger towards the movie or Abrams. I didn't feel anything. With the pass of the weeks I ended up feeling something: sadness. I really can't understand why people with half a brain can say this is not a disgrace and even argue is one of the best. I really can't. For me... it's just the end. I'll enjoy the first 6 movies and try to forget this disgrace. I really felt dirty when the movie finished. Disney can forget about my money. And I write this several weeks after wasting my money for this... thing.Star Wars The Force Awoken Review I have just watched the film after weeks or being too nervous .  After the 30 minutes of franchise related adverts ,the trailers started .A constant flow of good vs evil franchise films starting with London has Fallen ,Captain America ,Civil War, Star Trek ,X- men .  Seriously this constant flow of formulaic drivel has become laughable .Time to try something different perhaps .  The new characters in the film all seemed very light weight ,there was no real character development at all for Finn . I didn't appreciate the way that every significant character seemed to just bump into each other regardless of where they landed .  The discovery of the LightSabre was also a very questionable scene .  Another criticism was the situation between Leia ,Han and their son now choosing to work for the evil Empire . They seemed to accept the situation a little too easily for my liking .  The acting of Domhnall Gleeson was pantomime camp .  The scene where Rey discovers her powers and then uses then was atrocious .  The scene showing the death of Han was over thought and you could see the outcome from a mile off .  The obsession with Death Star Super weapons was boring and the usual split action scene of space battle / significant character battle really has become an over used cliché .  I never enjoyed one scene in the whole film .  I am truly broken hearted ,and what the hell was that final scene of Rey holding a light sabre and Luke facing her .It was nothing more than a scene devised for an 80s style flyover scene reminiscent of Clash of the Titans (original).  My rating 2/10The Force Falls Asleep Well I finally went to see the movie, with a total of 5 others in the theater! As I feared, the force has fallen asleep. This was pathetic as I kept seeing the same story, the same roles, doing the same things and everything else as it was before. Heck, even the animated chess board on the Millennium Falcon was activated (and probably right back to where it was left 30 years ago)! OMG is this the best they could come up with? Really? Hiding underneath the floor/deck in the MF, is that all they can think up? Oh but hey, the MF has a new radar dish on it, rectangular shaped vs round...30 years allowed for that significant advancement. The XWing fighters are still the same, after 30 years? Even the US Air Force upgrades to better technology in 30 years. Even the alien band playing looked very familiar in the dark café/club....Where was the Rancour? (sp?). Even an evil alien there transmitting 'top secret' information...oh so boring, boring! We have a masked bad guy with dark powers and all the rest... Really! OMG this was boring and painful to watch. The movie previews for other movies before this sleepy rehash were more interesting! And a big cavern/hole for someone to fall down into... I guess Han Solo/HF said kill me please, I can't take this same old drama again after 30 years. I could go on and on, and I'm sure it's all been covered by other reviewers but at least I have said my part. JJ, a major disappointment, pathetic that this is all you could come up with. And Mark Hamill/LS didn't even say a word, how silly. I won't be buying this on BluRay and I won't bother to see the next movie. Yawn, the force is putting me to sleep, darn mitochondria (sp?) are acting up again, laughing at me for spending money to see the same old over again!The Farce Awakens   -  "I find your lack of vision... disturbing." Intro crawler &amp; Star Wars fanfare.  Opening scene - cut to a Star Destroyer in orbit above a planet. We then meet one of our heroes as they attempt to escape &amp; evade an attack from stormtroopers.  Our hero however is unsuccessful &amp; is instead captured by the dark lord &amp; his troops. Before being captured however, they manage to secret information vital to the resistance within their loyal droid. This droid is then tasked with reaching the resistance where this information will be retrieved. The droid sets off aimlessly across the wastelands of a harsh desert planet, pursued by a garrison of stormtroopers intent on finding it asap.  The droid is however captured first by a small statured scavenger of this planet, but is soon liberated by our main hero - a young desert wanderer and cunning pilot, who dreams of a brighter future. Meanwhile the dark forces have constructed a new technological terror. A super weapon so devastating, it can destroy entire planets with one blast of its mighty cannon.  Our female hero is captured by the dark lord, held prisoner &amp; interrogated within this new super weapon. But, with the aid of Han Solo &amp; Chewbacca, a daring rescue mission is staged which combines an attack on the shield generators of this super weapon. Cue a shock father/son epiphany and stand off within its chasmic interior. Following the defeat of the shield generator, a glorious X-Wing attack is staged (incorporating a hazardous trench run against enemy laser turrets and Tie Fighters) The planet sized super weapon is quickly defeated &amp; the X-Wing fleet escape the engulfing catastrophe.  Does any of this sound familiar? You would be forgiven for thinking that I have just described Episode IV! But sadly not. Daisy Ridley was an excellent choice as Rey. Kylo Ren amounted to a 2-dimensional teenager throwing tantrums, who removes his mask at anyone's request. General Hux was a painfully diluted character, bearing no more malice than a mild cold. And Captain Phasma? Was there really any point? George Lucas did it all before and better in the 1970's and was original at the same time.Been There, Done That **SPOILER ALERT** **SPOILER ALERT**  Wow, this movie was an identical to is predecessors... nothing new here Check list:  Young Jedi on a desert plant - Check!    Death star - Check!    Resistance pilot flying through the tunnel to destroy the death star - Check!    Crappy robot with secret message - Check!    Han Solo - Check!   Evil dude covered with black mask - Check!  But what really annoys me, is that a young Jedi who 30 minutes ago thought that The Force is a myth and Luke is a legend learned how to use the force in 1 day and defeats the evil masked guy who is training in the force his entire life....Star wars : The copy awakens Why o why after almost 40 years is the same exact movie recreated as the one from 1977 ? This so called blockbuster is an exact copy of episode 4 with little bits from 5 thrown in to fill the 2 hour running time. Even the soundtrack is more or less the same. I can understand the fans wanting something that securely sits in the star wars universe, but a 100% exact copy ? What is the point of this movie, what is its audience ? Most people, even the kids, will have seen the original many many times on TV, in home cinemas or on the small screen that's in front of you in tourist class when flying long haul, there is no need for a copy. Really annoying is the political correctness in this movie, here we have a black main character and a Hispanic side kick, of course all the evil is done by white men, so the Asians are missing , so you can be sure that the replacement for a character that's killed off in this episode will pop up next time and be Asian, o my. Near the end of the movie i found myself shouting "look at the size of this thing !", but not in an amused , but rather annoyed way. If you like things being blown up, stormtroopers still missing everyone with their "Peeew peeew" blasters and gender neutral toilets, go see it ! Otherwise just look at episode 4 yet again.Did not feel like Star Wars Here is a list of why this movie blows and why it didn't feel like Star Wars. 1. There was to much forced comedy with Finn, Poe, Solo, and Kylo Ren. Keep it simple with just BB-8.  2. Poe takes out 10 Tie Fighters and 2 stormtroopers within 10 seconds in his X-wing. Not even Wedge can do that. This ruined the whole movie for me.  3. Poe talks about how Tie Fighters can "really move" when he's flying one but then he is able to fly circles around them in his X-wing.  4. Kylo Ren uses force stasis on blaster bolts. Force Stasis only works on people, not blasters bolts. 5. No call signs for pilots. In this movie they were Cowboys in space. Not once they say, for example "This is Red-5."  6. Finn is able to take on a Sith lord, without dying. A trooper fighting a Sith lord would not be able to hold their ground, but Finn did.  7. A remake of A New Hope. 8. I love John Williams but the musical score was kind of weak.  9. C-3P0 has a red arm. Why? And why does he have 2 gold arms at the very end? lol No explanation.  10. Rey uses Jedi Mind trick on a stormtrooper and she has never been trained to use the force. Enough said.Use the Schwarz, J.J.! .. after Mel Brooks in Spaceballs. J.J.Abrams should have stuck to something he does not kill. The Force in this case. If there would be justice, this movie would never have been created due to copyright infringement. Except that those rich enough can buy up anything, strip it from the essential values and present a much worse version, erasing the past. The original from 77' was a classic: reinvention of the sci-fi genre, storyline, visuals, morality. This one was obviously hyped by global branding worthy of the 21st century. And that's exactly the issue: a 10 for marketing, but a mediocre 6 for the actual product, the movie, which in my book means a 2, just to pull the odds straight on a fair voting result. Here's the why: 1. Storyline: an EXACT copy of Episode 4, the first Star Wars movie ever made! Poor hero(ine) coincidentally meets droid that holds plan that is key to master plan - meet Han Solo / Chewbacca - meet forces of good – fighting forces of evil where black-masked prime-evil guy turns out to be family member – while fighting evil dude on bridge, planet-sized planet-destroying machine needs to be destroyed, before it erases all the good guys - fighter plane fight after disabling shielding device - shooting in tunnel - last-minute destruction of monstrosity by hitting it with a few loose guns at its core, which is practically unprotected. Everything is EXACTLY THE SAME in this sequel, almost 40 years after having made the first such movie, when the whole story was still original! This obviously shows the intent to address the second and third generation of kids, the children of those who saw the original. It adds absolutely nothing however in originality. 2. Casting: having said it's a rip-off, it doesn't stop there. Aged actors from the original movie (Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Best Friend Chewbacca) line up to remind us that this IS Star Wars. This time around however to appeal to the "elder" generation: those who were kids when they first watched SW and should now feel connected enough to keep bringing their kids to the remaining two episodes as well.. The younger actors (Finn, Rey, Kylo Ren) however are just a joke. While Finn is the funny guy who needs to appeal to insecurities in all of us and never takes off his surprised-look mask (despite chopping up half the galaxy while he's "doing the right thing"), Rey is the next-gen copy of Luke Skywalker, except it's the 21st-cent politically correct (female) version that speaks as if she just left drama class, but despite the haughtiness of noblesse, feels the need to stomp around like a fishwife. Unlike the old Luke", she is a modern control-freak, the emancipated girl-power type, sweat dripping in buckets by the effort of balancing femininity with the pseudo-liberal BS of "equality". Literally the actress is overwhelmed by her role and she simply overdoes it where most would have failed anyway, but better casting would still have saved some face. Third in row is the hysterical spoiled brat Kylo Ren, who sounds quite cool while still in his mask, if only he would not behave like a 5 year old who is easier manipulated than a puppy and looses the sinister image as soon as he takes off his mask and starts smashing furniture at the slightest setback. Reminds us of the same mistake made with using Hayden Christensen who played Anakin Skywalker turning from naive kid to hurt adolescent in Episode 3. Shouldn't that have been a sign for J.J.Abrams not to make the same mistake of taking away coolness from a Jedi?.. Breaking kitchenware will hardly appeal to any 21st century kid when the prime-evil character needs a touch of coolness. I don't even go into detailing the new "wise" CGI character of the 21st century politically-correct (female) version of Yoda, a passing whim with not a fraction of Yoda's charisma, despite being 1000 years of age. Oh, the glasses..yeah, I guess that makes her wise. Just shows how poor of a job the director did, if a character needs glasses to gain some respect from the viewer. Maybe a tattoo like "I'm the smartest chick around the block" would have been even more obvious J.J., on her forehead! To sum up the cast(rat)ing change: while almost 40 years ago we had a kid with hidden talents and a strong sister who finally melted by the charms of a bounty hunter, with the most bad-ass black-masked Evil of all times, J.J.Abrams now gave us panicky Finn, angry Rey and hysterical K-ren.. Just shows you Hollywood does not want role-models kids could look up to but gives them excuses for being like a wet rag. 3. Dialogues and character development: repetitive, simplistic jokes that were trendy when they first appeared by Spielberg in the eighties in the Indiana Jones franchise. Are they still cool 30 years later?.. If J.J. Abrams partners with Spielberg in the future, I would understand his urge to comply with the Master of Hollywood's flat directing style at the cost of authenticity, but for everyone else it's time travel backwards and not in a nostalgic sense. The movie and the reviews show that it pays off to totally remake a movie with no originality, poor acting, not even using minor storyline techniques to show anything new, brainwashing the audience to even reviewing it positively and not even to be punished for it. It's cheap, it's a disgraceful abuse of an original idea and all the energy put into the original movie and makes me wonder why this should be allowed in the first place. At any case, it robs a whole generation that grew up with Star Wars from its past, to replace it with a cheap remake.Star Wars, Episode VII: A New Reboot Watching this movie is like having the pathways in your brain responsible for the feeling of deja vu malfunction and get stuck on replay. For 138 minutes. ***Spoilers*** "The Force Awakens" is basically "A New Hope" in a peculiar alternate universe. In this strange new realm, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia have both been reincarnated as the same character: Rey. Rey is the highlight of the movie, not really for her story or Ridley's acting performance, but because of her Luke-like earnestness and Ridley's good looks. Han Solo has been reincarnated as Finn. But instead of being a hotshot pilot and pirate, he is now a goofy janitor, runaway stormtrooper, and blundering coward. Sheesh, makes you wonder what Harrison Ford did to make JJ Abrams get back at him in such an underhanded and passive aggressive way.... Obi-Wan has come back as an elderly version of Han Solo. "Who's more foolish now, eh? The fool, or the one who follows the fool".... Or the one who becomes the fool? Tee hee! Abrams, whatever problem you have with Harrison Ford, you should settle it like normal people. Face-to-face. Off-screen. Darth Vader has been reincarnated as the character of Severus Snape. Which is a bit odd, even for this alternate version reality. Eh, if JK Rowling's okay with it, I guess we should be, too. Palpatine is Snoke. Yoda appears as a yellow Pokemon alien. There are no new planets. Tatooine, Yavin 4, and Hoth are all featured in this movie, but with different names, of course. As is the case for the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance, and the Empire. Even the Death Star plans have made a comeback -- as coordinates for Luke's location. (Elderly, second-Yoda Luke, not Rey). In a SW first, there is no eye candy for the ladies in this movie. Okay, so the red-haired reincarnation of Moff Jerjerrod, but he's barely seen, and maybe Poe Dameron (new Wedge Antilles) who's also barely there. Rey unfortunately never wears any beautifully outlandish SW costumes, which is another SW first for a female lead. Sorry, girls. Needless to say, I won't be paying to watch the next chapter in SW, "The Reboot Strikes Back," though I have to admit I'm a bit curious who and what General Rieekan, Lando Calrissian, the AT-AT walkers, and the space slug will reincarnate as.I'm so disappointed I still can't believe it. How is it possible to turn something special, into something awful in just two hours. The whole Sci-Fi community waited such a long time for the SW - Saga to carriing on. And then came this. One of the most ...... up movies I ever had to watch in my entire life. J.J. Abrams is one the most uncreative, non visionairy falsifier in the film industry. Every movie directed by him, has a enormous touch of a cheap TV-series. So does "HIS" Star Wars Movie. I say his movie because, this is not a movie made for the millions of fans all over the world, who looked forward for a new breath taking adventure. Specially for those who already read Timothy Zahn's Star Wars books, this movie is just unbearable. No it is only made to satify his own, way to big ego. He already ruined the Star Trek Saga by turning it in to a stupid crash-boom-bang movie, taking place in a parallel universe. And now he destroyed Star Wars. I just hope, that the upcoming movies will be produced under the advice of George Lucas. That would be really nice, because it hurts to read all those reviewes from angry and disappointed fans. Ant it hurts much more to be one those.JJ Abrams ruined Star Wars and possibly the future of the franchise I would like to start this review but saying that I have seen all the movies and have read almost every expanded universe book that has been written, something that I highly doubt J.J. Abrams has done. There weren't many things done right with this movie except that the graphics looked good and there was not an annoying Jar Jar Binks-like character. The major issues that I see are: 1) The movie is essentially a remake of the original Star Wars. The new rebellion (aka the Resistance). A new empire (aka the First Order). A new Luke Skywalker (aka Rey). New Death Star (aka much bigger death star). I don't even know if they can come back from this... 2) The expanded universe books are so good and they decided to completely trash everything that has been written about Star Wars and start over. I think this is a big mistake. 3) The casting seemed motivated from a diversity/politically correct perspective. I am all for diversity, but they went way overboard. 4) The strong female main character, Rey, is from a backwater planet with virtually nothing positive to say about it. However, she is stronger, faster, and smarter than everyone around her including Han Solo and the trained warrior, Finn (more comments about him below). She knows how to fix and fly a starship. She can use a light saber and beat a trained dark-side force user in one-on-one combat. This trained force user is incredibly powerful as shown by his ability to stop a blaster bolt in mid-fire, something that would be incredibly difficult for only but the strongest force users. Also, she showed Han Solo how to fix his ship that he has been using for 50 years. 5) Finn is a storm trooper, taken from his parents at birth and trained as a fighter and warrior. Yet, he acts scared throughout the movie. He doesn't know how to fight, fly a ship, or anything else a trained warrior should be able to do. Instead, Rey, who grew up on a backwater planet is the fighter and not afraid of anything. Rey, who was never trained to do anything really except survive on a backwater desert planet. I am extremely disappointed and cannot imagine that George Lucas approved of this. I have lost a LOT of respect for J. J. Abrams and think that he might have irretrievably ruined the story line.Complete and Utter Insult to the Star Wars Universe Really enjoyed Marvel's Star Wars.

It is always that Sith Lords work in pairs, and refused to learn the lesson that two will always lose out to all the Jedis. And the Sith Lords always like to build an artificial planet, despite learning that the idea will never match a few good planes bombing its energy core. This really came at an expense on the quality of work and story of Disney.Too Nostalgic, but Still Good With a series as beloved as Star Wars, anything is possible. The Force Awakens, the beginning of the sequel trilogy, is quite possibly the most anticipated movie of all time. The fact that it reeled in a record breaking $250,000,000 opening weekend in the U.S. alone is a testament to the popularity of this franchise. So, was it worth the wait? That's an interesting question. For many people, myself included, the nostalgia blinders came with the movie. The anticipation before the opening crawl and the euphoria that that classic opening note brought was an unforgettable experience. This movie brought out happy memories of watching the Original Trilogy for the first time, and the wonder and mystery that the galaxy of Star Wars brought us. However, the movie relies way too much on the nostalgia factor. The best and most memorable things about this movie (aside from that scene, of course) were the opening crawl, the appearance of the Millennium Falcon, the first appearances of the original characters (especially Han and Chewie), and the scene with Darth Vader's helmet. Aside from those things, it's a carbonite copy of the original 1977 movie, with the exact same story arc. There's very little originality, which is a massive detractor. Even the ships and vehicles are exactly the same, with a few exceptions. Of course, Starkiller Base is just another Death Star, even if the way it works is awesome. Even the character's roles feel recycled from the Original Trilogy. Rey is Luke (the desert dwelling, force sensitive protagonist), Finn is Han (The guy who tries to stay out of it but ends up coming back in), Poe is Leia (The one with the droid with the important message), BB-8 is R2-D2 (said droid), Han is Obi-Wan (The mentor who fought in the previous war), and Luke is Yoda (The Jedi who is now a recluse). While this is bad, it doesn't mean the characters are bad. They're not entirely recycled, but the roles they play certainly are. This isn't a bad movie, though. There really is a lot to like. The new characters were pretty good. With Rey, they set her up as a very mysterious figure, one you wonder about regarding who she is and where she's going. While Force Awakens doesn't reveal any of that, it sets it up for later installments. (By the way, this review is judging TFA independently from Last Jedi). Finn goes from being a cowardly deserter to someone who stands up and fights for his cause. Poe's nothing to write home about. Kylo Ren is simultaneously the best character in this movie and the worst. He's the best at the beginning, when you first see him in the black armor with the hood up. He looks awesome. Without the helmet, he's not so great. BB-8 is just about the cutest droid/robot ever. Also extremely marketable. Snoke was great. Han and Chewie really stole the show, mostly because of how long its been since they had screen time together. And also, unlike with the Prequels, when you know what's going to happen, as you've probably seen the Originals, there's a feeling of suspense where you know the characters you've grown to love are in danger, and you desperately want to see them come out OK. Oh, and, you know that feeling when you really want to talk about a movie spoiler but you can't because not everyone saw it as early as you? Yeah. This really went into effect here. Upon the first viewing of this movie, the nostalgia factor made it appear much better than it actually is. I thought this movie was a solid 9/10 after seeing it for the first time. It really isn't. It's still a good movie, though. Most of the callbacks to the original trilogy were welcome, the visuals are spectacular, John Williams continues his perfect track record, and most importantly, it got us interested in where they would take the series with the next installment.Superb Thankfully, the Star Wars franchise can get back to fun, and character, and unpredictability. After the durge created by the flaccid prequel trilogy, where there was no emotion, nor effort to wield a lightsaber, and no need to develop personality, it's great to see an unhinged evil character, an uncertain female protagonist, and an awesome droid!  Fanboys will obviously lament not having back stories and canon adherence to "the force", or that stuffy old men aren't as prolific in this new version, but this is the way forward, not dwelling in the past.  Lucas proved he was no director with EPS 1-3, so it is great to have the mantle handed over to film makers.Few risks, fan service and opening some questions My title sums up this movie. You want to see the Falcon? A cool red light-saber? Han and Chewie? And see a bunch of X-wings destroy the Deat... I mean Starkiller base? Well, you'll get it. Casting is pretty decent, Poe, Finny and even BB8 are kinda okay. Rey, I still don't know what to think of her. A bit too naïve and innocent in my opinion but she's not annoying at least. And Kylo... Kylo is pretty much the risk this movie has taken, by making him look really awesome with his outfit, saber and mask aaaaand surprising you when you see his face. I think it was a good choice in the end. It's a solid and simple star wars movie. A bit of plot and "star wars science" holes, like how in such a huge galaxy can they see the shot of starkiller and the explosion of the planets? Unless they're in the same system, not possible. During the fight after Maz Cantina gets blown up... where did everyone go? The cantina was full. Somehow only Han and friends get out of the debris. Rey's awakening is a bit weird but why not. Personally I would have made her force sensitive when she's running after Finn who's going to get eaten by the weird worm creatures on Han's ship. Not even going to ask why did those creatures insta kill all the bad guys but they capture Finn... with all those tentacles, don't ask. Anyways, a good and entertaining star wars movie. Good action, decent actors, good CGI. Just a bit too predictable.7 but still my least favorite I have to be honest with myself. For some reason when I watched this movie it felt like there was something missing. The prequels to the original get so much constant hate and criticism and no one points out the positive things about those movies.. .. I actually enjoyed watching those movies more than this one despite some cheesy lines, over use of CGI and annoying characters like JaJa..  I feel this way because episodes 1-3 still had that magic touch.. I don't know what it is but it still maintained a certain type of feel and flow of the original movies. It had things about those movies that were very memorable, original, yet still felt familiar.. That is what I feel was lacking in this one. There was nothing about it that really stood out.. It tried to be Star Wars so hard, but it failed. It just felt like "someone else" was trying to copy and remake the Star Wars theme.. None of the characters were memorable.. None of the fight scenes were really memorable.. Each one of the Star Wars movies before it had something that really stood out . I could watch all six of the Star Wars movies over again .... But this one I feel like after watching it once.. I don't really care if I see it again. Even Harrison Ford didn't look into it. It was like someone dragged him out of bed and forced him to do this movie.. His acting was very lack luster.  There was no imagination in this movie but simply a rehash without the same flow and rhythm of the other six.. Here's what stands out for me. . Ep 1 - Darth maul.. 10x better of a character.. the one in force awakens felt more like watching a space balls villain .... Pod racing.. That really stood out.. The music and fight scenes with darth maul... Awesome acting by liam Neeson and McGreggor..  Ep2- The clone wars battle scene was a pretty epic battle and very memorable. Seeing yoda younger and actually fighting was memorable even if it was funny to watch. A lot of memorable acting and synergy between Anakin and Obi Wan..  Ep3- was dark, told the story that lead up to the originals... The final battle was very memorable.. the ending stood in my mind for awhile... The Emperors acting was on point..  Force awakens- The best thing i liked about it really was the new droid.. Oh and if you want to count a progressive approach having a woman and black guy be the main characters.. but I don't really care about any of that.  My score... originals were my favorite. followed by rogue one and the prequels.. Force Awakens was the least enjoyable to watch for me.What happened to Star Wars? This movie was okay, but not even close to as good as the original trilogy.The Force(d) Awakens J.J. Abrams reignites and revitalizes a galaxy far, far away with raw, practical wonder like never before, with a story that feels like more of an unfulfilling reunion show, but an exhilarating reunion nonetheless. Ever since the prequels, in fact ever since the originals, we (Star Wars enthusiasts) have been anxiously anticipating a return to the Star Wars universe, and ever since it was announced back in 2013, it rose the potential for a brand new trilogy, hopefully out-grown and learned from the prequels, and true to the originals, to create something truly new and extraordinary. With a whole new set of characters, in a whole new set of stories, extraordinary, it is not. I don't want to bum out the incredibly protective fanbase, but if you're hoping for new planets, a different kind of Star Wars story we'd never seen before, or even an exploration of things you'd only dream of, dream again because Force Awakens takes such a safe route that it almost replicates, frame-by-frame, arch-by-arch "A New Hope" in a very respectable, but unnecessary way. First and foremost, the problem I have with "safe movies," is there's nothing to hate because no risks were taken. Example given// The Force Awakens. Now, that's not to say I didn't enjoy the movie by any stretch of the imagination because there's so much to love here. There's a certain mold that defines Star Wars and J.J. understands that beautifully. What I mean is the franchise's so-called style sort of rides this fine line of being overly-cheesy and overly-romantic in its cinematic experience. And its a style that really only works with Star Wars, but it's also a style that has become beloved and cherished by millions of people on the planet. And that said, "The Force Awakens" fully embraces this style and projects it on a stage of film-making, entertainment and execution that is at an incredibly high-level of craft, higher than almost any previous installment. It's all there. The performances are sensational, and are even better than expected. The returnees such as Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill are all terrific. But it's the new cast that's significant in this one, and do they ever steal the show. Daisy Ridley plays a wondrous scavenger in Rey, who really is the heart and hope of The Force Awakens, giving us a true female hero for this generation. John Boyega plays a runaway stormtrooper named FN217, or aka Finn, and comes across annoying at times, but plays it in a real "Star Warsy" way that's effective. But the one to talk about is Adam Driver who plays the emotionally corrupt villain Kylo Ren, who comes across so stellar that in his character's desires to become the next Darth Vader, you actually wish he was as he nails the Star Wars villain with humor and class as good as any before him. So in terms of craft and breaking down the filmmaking elements of "The Force Awakens," this movie has it all. But if those elements are in just a simple, safe story that you wish would go to the next level, then it's just promise. But you put those elements in a daring story, it's extraordinary. Unfortunately, it strays in the prior and stays safe. Without judging the performances, the new characters of Rey, Kylo and Finn are intriguing, but are nothing new. Furthermore where they take these characters, which could've been interesting to any inventive writer, they instead put in them in the default Star Wars character setting in the same-old story-verse we've seen and heard many times before. Now, the default setting isn't a bad thing, it's just that's what's keeping Episode 7 from being extraordinary. Now about the title. This installment delves into a concept that is referred to in the title as "The Force Awakens." Intriguing and relevant to the new trilogy. But as much as it is true in some ways, it isn't as relevant as it needs to be. In fact, to think about it, when was the Force ever Awakening, and when you really think about, there are only really 1 or 2 moments in the grand scale of the journey that makes this relevant in any way. The story actually focuses more on the search for Luke Skywalker, which in retrospect gives more sense to Episode 7 being titled "The Last Jedi," or even "Search for the Last Jedi." But, shouldn't it be exploring its own new fresh awakening, which is why its called Force Awakens in the first place? Yes, and that is where this movie is flawed. Not saying this movie doesn't go anywhere, it certainly does especially in the last act of the film. Its just for a good portion of this episode, we're left waiting in anxiety and we start to force our own awakening and wonder upon this movie in hopes it'll create some of it's own. It eventually does, but the line from the Yoda-like character referred to as Maz says, "a different question for a different time," completely defines this movie. Then until its final breathes, do we realize this may just be where the story really gets going. But it ends right there. Sure, it was a fun ride, but there were so much unfulfilled desires and hopes in the story and characters, other than the craftsmanship, there's really no reason to revisit Force Awakens other than getting giddy about a few promises that are soon to come, in sequels ahead. Yes, I am going overboard with the criticism here. But there was potential to take this installment in a direction that could've been extraordinary and new. The filmmaking was there, the performances were all there, but I feel as though the production was too in awe that they were making a Star Wars movie, and gave us something fun that pays too much omage. But that doesn't mean it isn't an exhilarating voyage into a galaxy far, far away. Its exuberant, fresh and has moments with awe that slice you right through the heart. Yes, it has its flaws, but every Star Wars movie does In the end of the day, this is a fine addition to an already celebrated and unprecedented saga that only brushes the surface, but brushes it in the most exciting way imaginable and leaves us a lot to look forward to. May the Force Be With You!An average Star Wars movie While doing her routine search for items which will bring her daily dose of food, Rey saves a tiny droid which is in need of even more help. Carrying an important piece of information, it must be taken urgently to the rebels. Together with a new friend, she'll have to face many adventures until the BB-8 completes its quest before the First Order gets its hands on him. This instalment of the Star Wars franchise has its story set in a time where The First Order has only the last hiding forces of the rebels to defeat before taking complete control. Young Rey is introduced into the story, along with her special abilities, who will prove to be a key factor in what is to come. We follow her, throughout many perils, full of captivating CGI and action sequences, typical to the series. Unfortunately, these are the main pluses of the movie, and not the same can be said about the story and the characters. Many are annoying or simply stupid, without a clear idea of their role, contributing one way or another to a story which simply doesn't provide something truly great. It is just OK, not very predictable but also not very complex, doing its job but nothing more.  I found it to be quite an average film, with only a couple of characters which are pleasant and dignified to be watched, bringing some substance to an average story which also contains characters which simply shouldn't exist, which have a tendency of getting on your nerves more than being useful. Besides this problems, if you look closer, you can still find some good aspects which ultimately transform this movie into a rather good watch. It still looks great, has plenty of action, and at least two or three good characters which somehow make up to the other disappointments. Overall, I found an average movie, which definitely could have been a lot better, but it simply fell into mediocrity due to a lack of story complexity and character development. I'm pretty sure that the series' fans will be disappointed with it, but for me it was somewhat OK.Recycled, nostalgic, and practically perfect JJ Abrams is really good at this: recycle the plot, reconfigure the characters and let the action take center stage. It is a simple formula. And it makes this movie cook with gas. Despite basically being a remake of the first Star Wars - from the plot to the characters - this story feels fresh and fun. Part of that's performances, but most of it is Abrams' sense of pace: more action, less trade policy. The flaws from the original trilogy are all here, especially the plot holes. But it is hard to notice them when you are having this much fun. Well worth the wait. (Let's pretend those prequels never happened.)Bringing back Star Wars !!! There is a moment towards the middle of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' when Han Solo says the following to Rey and Finn - "It's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true." - that particular line of dialogue to me completely and very clearly established and underlines the motive and the intent of JJ Abrams and Disney as a whole behind their collective approach in restarting the Star Wars Saga. Since the souring of the mood and the spirits of the diehard Star Wars fans triggered by the prequels, there had been a prolonged gap. The basic idea of 'The Force Awakens' is to end that gap by reaffirming the myths, the legends and the magic of Star Wars and reassure the fanbase with a film that symbolises the phrase - 'Star Wars(in its original form) is back !!!'  To me this idea of reaffirming the legend of 'Star Wars' has two repercussions which are very noticeable in the film. On one hand, certain elements that make the original trilogy wondrous like the joy and innocence of fantasies and adventures, Han Solo's charisma, etc. On the other hand, it also brings along with it the elements that have always prevented me from fully embracing Star Wars which are surface level storytelling, hokey and over-expressive dialogue,etc. Another problem with the film is that in trying to deliver on 'fan service', the film doubles down and flirts with the prospect of being a little over-abundant on references and moments that pay explicit homage to the original trilogy as well as overall narrative throughlines that again blatantly mirror a number of the occurrences in previous films in the series.  However what prevents the film from becoming an excuse in nostalgia porn is the characters. The new characters especially Rey and Finn were very likeable and they seem like individuals that I as a viewer would like to accompany in future adventures and spend time with. I mentioned earlier how 'Force Awakens' reaffirms the myths of Star Wars. Through Daisy Ridley's 'Rey', the film goes one step forward by hinting at powers and abilities which are unprecedented and almost incomprehensible(to Rey herself), the sources of which will probably be elaborated upon in the sequels. Harrison Ford manages to embody the swashbuckling Han Solo once again after all these years and it feels like older version of the exact same character from the original trilogy with the same charisma and sarcasm. Kylo Ren seemed interesting enough.  In an nutshell the film embodies certain elements that I have never completely been in tune with which are inherent to the concept of Star Wars itself. But having said that, with the basic energy and the exciting new characters, JJ Abrams managed to make me not only care about about this film, but also curious about what's to come next.A remake This film was visually stunning. However I feel it was simply a remake of episode IV: A New Hope with a subplot attached. I was and still am disappointed with the way this movie turnedBetter than I remember The first time I watched this I thought it was the worst in the saga but now on rewatch I find it the best after the original trilogy. This is the only Star Wars film until that point, including the original trilogy, in which I didn't cringe at a dialogue or acting at some point of the film. The set up of all the new characters and the world is so perfect while giving enough importance to the old characters just enough.Faithful to original films whilst bringing something new. Abrams' achievement in rebooting SW with such faithfulness to the original trilogy will guarantee his place in the history books as perhaps the greatest movie director.I'd give this a 10 if it weren't for "A New Hope" I'd have to admit, if this were a standalone film it would be fantastic, because JJ Abrams and his new crew of Star Wars makers did a really good job. However, I have no idea why, but for some reason he and Lawrence Kasdan decided to steal most if not all the aspects of "A New Hope" into this new storyline that would either make or break Disney's reputation for how well they can handle Star Wars. So here's my basic analysis of this movie compared to Episode IV (minor spoilers, if you don't want to read ahead). How the plot lines up with Episode IV  Stormtroopers, plus a Sith Lord who wears a mask that digitizes his voice, attack the good guys because they have valuable information, and one of the good guys sends off a droid with that information before getting captured. That droid with the valuable information comes across the lead protagonist, on a sandy planet, who later discovers Jedi powers. The stormtroopers find the droid with its Jedi partner, but then they escape in the Millennium Falcon (which the Jedi character regards as trashy). The bad guys have their headquarters on a gigantic fortress that has a cannon that can destroy entire planets. The new Jedi character comes across Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber. The new Jedi and friends come across the team of good guys and go to their planet that is moderately forest but somewhat swampy (I'm almost starting to wonder if it's the same planet in both movies), and discuss how to defeat the bad guys' planet-destroying headquarters. The good guys, with their X-Wings and Y-Wings, attack the enemy headquarters as it's preparing to destroy the good guys' headquarters. The Sith Lord manages to escape alive, along with various other members of his team, for the sake of setting up a sequel.  Here's other features of Episode IV that were placed in out of order  A stormtrooper rescues one of the bad guys' prisoners (the same prisoner who sent off the droid with the valuable information). The Millennium Falcon gets captured by tractor-beam. Han Solo has an unsettled debt with criminals. The main characters enter a cantina, where the gad buys have a spy who notices the droid with the valuable information (which later leads to a battle) , and one of the main characters pays someone for transportation. The main characters manually go in to disable the bad guys' fortress' shield. A old, mentor character is killed by the Sith Lord.  Now on the positive side, let me mention some original material (or at the very least, material that makes this plot unique) that this movie had.  The new Sith's lightsaber - it not only has the laser hilts, but the saber itself seems to have a different texture to it than most lightsabers. For some reason, none of the Sith are called "Darth". New force powers were introduced (such as force freeze and force faint), however I'm not too sure whether that's a plus for this movie. The leading character is female (all the previous Star Wars movies have had male characters), and she lives as a scavenger. A stormtrooper, out of his own conscience, chooses to betray the bad guys; this clearly shows actual personality to them as opposed to the previous Star Wars films, which depicts them as merely expendable objects. The new Jedi is able to discover that she is a Jedi all on her own; in Luke's and Anakin's cases, they needed another Jedi master to tell them that they were Jedi. The second-to-last fight scene is perhaps the most original Star Wars battle to date (the one on the green planet where that cantina is). A non-Jedi wields a lightsaber to fight the bad guys (Han Solo in E. V never fought stormtroopers with Luke's lightsaber, and General Grievous in E. III was already a bad guy). A stormtrooper wields a melee weapon, though this does somewhat compare to the Magnaguards in E. III. The Sith takes off his mask to show how ordinary he is (however, people initially laughed at his non-masked appearance). The Jedi=Sith battle at the end showed that neither side had too much experience with lightsabers. The valuable information contained by the droid isn't about defeating the bad guys, but it sets up the sequel.  The only reason why everyone has been rating this film 1-5 is because of how much of a remake of E. IV this is. I can totally understand their disappointment, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the movie itself was bad. I do agree that I was a little dumbfounded to see that this movie was too exact to E. IV, but I do still think that this movie was good enough to set a good reputation for Disney occupying Star Wars (you can at least admit that this movie was better than the prequels, right?). Like I said before, this is the only reason why I am rating this a 7; otherwise, I would have rated it a 10.Good old Star Wars action but déjà vu First of all, as a huge Star Wars fan, I find that seeing a Star Wars movie on IMAX 3D with the latest CGI technology was astonishing. That movie was very beautiful. It successfully captured the essence of a Star Wars movie and I am not just talking about space and Jedi battles. I am talking about the mythical aspect of it like the good versus evil, light and dark, hope and despair contradictions. I am also talking about the constant change between order and stability for chaos and destruction. The story was dramatic and interesting but nothing we haven't already seen. This movie has so many similarities with A New Hope that it can be seen has an attempt to make easy money with the less effort possible. Seriously, the "Empire" has a huge super weapon and the "Rebels" need to stop it before it blows up planets. A mentor dies to help the greater cause. The apprentice uses her new found power to fight off the dark side. There wasn't much originality in the story but it the movie was still successful at capturing the essence of Star Wars. I really liked the new actors that they chose for this film. Especially John Boyega as Finn. That guy with BB8 were they comic duo of the movie. I really enjoyed watching them. Lupita Nyong'o is such a good actress. The way she acted, we were able to truly feel that Maz Kanata was very ancient and mystical. As for Rey, I wouldn't say that she was the best of the group but she played her role just fine. The only actor that I didn't feel that was fitting was Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. It's like Anakin Skywalker all over again but worst. I can understand that the Director wanted us to see that Kylo Ren is very conflicted between good and evil because of his ties to his family. That he was not a slave like Anakin and that he had everything before going to the dark side which make him looks like nothing is enough. The character really looked more immature than he should be. Even though he was a grown man, to me, he looked like a winy teenager. Finally, I could have been harder on the movie and give it less than a 7 but even though the story was not original, the actors and the universe gave this movie enough appeal so that I can recommend it.Everything old is new again I just came from seeing STAR WARS VII! Before I get started, I'd just like to point out that I have never seen a movie with as much hype behind it in my life! Disney has really pulled out all the stops and spared no expense in stoking the flames of this release. With all the merchandising and third party tie in's from makeup to jewelry to breakfast cereal to (no lie) oranges, this movie is set up to possibly be the biggest movie of all time! As a matter of fact, it's so set itself up that if it's anything less than that some will look at it as a failure. Directed by Hollywood powerhouse J.J. Abrams, the director of the Star Trek reboot, this new Star Wars movie seeks to blow more wind into the sails of the biggest film franchise of all time and wash the taste of the ill fated prequels from the mouths of Star Wars fans everywhere. So what does that mean for you, John and Jane Q. Movie-goer? Well, it typically means one of two things, either it is in fact the greatest movie ever made or it's a rotten piece of garbage that the studio is hoping for big numbers for in the first few weeks before people realize that it stinks on ice. Well folks, I've just come from the theater and I have to say that without a doubt, Star Wars delivers! Just to give you a bit of a background, the last time we we heard about the saga going on in a galaxy far, far away, Luke Skywalker and the Rebel Alliance had just defeated Darth Vader the evil Emperor Palpatine. The story in Star Wars VII takes place some 25 years after the defeat of the Galactic Empire where out of the ashes of the now defunct empire a new evil has emerged in the form of The First Order, an oppressive force bent on destroying Luke Skywalker and his group of Jedi Knights who have since gone into hiding. At the same time a faction of the Rebel Alliance known as The Resistance seeks to find Luke and fight The First Order. This story is centered around The characters Rey and Finn, two misfits, played by relative Hollywood newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega and their journey to help The Resistance find Luke Skywalker at any cost. I'd love to tell more, but given the nature of this film, it's best to leave the details of the plot alone. Let's just say that they, along with Oscar Issac, who plays the hot shot X-Wing pilot Poe, do a great job of breathing some much needed new life into this franchise. At the same time, Domhnall Gleeson, Adam Driver and Andy Circus are famously evil as the quasi-Nazi First Order. This movie is not all new blood however, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and all your favorite Star Wars heroes like Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 make appearances here and they work well to provide balance between the old and the new in the film. The special effects are fantastic, the action scenes are crisp and well choreographed and the story is thrilling, fast paced and immersive, with equal parts old and new Star Wars, bringing in new characters and new stories while at the same time taking quite a few cues from the original Star Wars which for me ended up being both heart warming and a little disappointing seeing as the familiar parts begin to give the movie a bit of the Ghostbusters 2 syndrome in that a few too many of the same notes from the old series are hit. All in all, I really really liked this movie and it's faults are all but crushed by it's hundreds of positives from funny script writing to thrilling visuals to the pure rush I got from seeing some of the old characters back together. I am definitely looking forward to seeing this movie at least another 2 times in the theater. Star Wars: The Force Awakens get a 4.5... out of 5.The Good, The Bad, &amp; The Ugly NOTE: I watched this film with an abject disdain. As a result I wasn't nearly as bitter by the time the film concluded. I've since rewatched it twice to get a better handle on how to rate it. I was born in the Time Gap between the Trilogy and the Prequels so I was very hyper-analytical when I watched this because I felt (And still feel) that the Prequels were an abomination where George Lucas attempted to cash in on the Trilogies iconic status. This is as unbiased a review as I can possibly produce. Here's the breakdown. Visuals: 8.1 (It was fine. It was space &amp; planets that looked like space &amp; planets)  Effects: 7.4 (Some of the CGI was still a little too out-of-place, but not awful)  Script &amp; Writing: 7.2 (It was better than the Lucas Prequels, so...yeah)  Sound &amp; Music: 8.1 (It's Star Wars. Give John Williams a baton or emulate him in every conceivable fashion &amp; you win)  Acting: 7.3 (It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but could have been better)  Directing: 7.6 (It was a fair approach that tried to honor the Trilogy)  Overall Rating: 7.6 (Fair to Decent) Whether you like this movie or do not will be entirely subjective to what you'd expect and hope it to be. I honestly cannot tell you whether or not you'll love it or hate it. I think how you approach it may ease the transition into it. As far as anyone's statements about PC-Star Wars or what not, I do disagree with that. I think the new actors did alright. They had an admittedly difficult set of shoes to fill. I'm obliged to maintain a spoiler free atmosphere with my reviews so I won't get into anything deeper than that. The returning cast did their jobs. The problem to me isn't that this movie was good or bad or ugly, the problem is the Ghostbusters-factor. After a certain amount of time has passed it gradually becomes impossible to produce a film, series, or variation of such based on an original film, series, or variation that will hold up to the standards of the fanbase. Is this film for kids? Probably not toddlers but yeah I'd say while some of the scenes have more aggressive tones older kids and younger teens could probably handle it fine. It depends on your child really. Will fans of the Trilogy like it? Depends on the fan and how they approach, along with their expectations upon entering. I didn't hate it. I didn't love it. It was fair to decent, parts were good, parts were meh, and parts were bad. Eye of the Beholder film for sure.It's Star Wars for new generation. That's what I told the guy sitting next to me in the theatre in South San Francisco off of 280 when he and I exchanged some thoughts on the then new Star Wars film. It was fun to see, but Disney's film is handicapped by the following; this film didn't come on the heels of 30+ years of ultra- serious dramas or very corny musicals, where sci-fi was a thing given to kiddies or the "brainiacs" or "nerds" who liked to engage in technical and scientific things, but who didn't date much (note the sexual undercurrent in a lot of sci-fi from the 50s and 60s). Star Wars, the original 1977 feature film, had that benefit. There was 2001 Space Odyssey, Logan's Run the year before with its awful miniatures, and the Star Trek TV series that had been canceled a few years before, but effects technology at the time was more miss than hit, and the genre itself, other than classic Star Trek, really wasn't taken all that seriously. So when Star Wars hit the screen people were blown away by it. The Force Awakens, or more specifically the people who made it, know they can't repeat those conditions that gave the 1977 film that "wow effect", so it steers more towards a graphic-novel like presentation, complete with emotional intrigue among the characters to try and compliment that large SFX wizardry that's presented on screen. But that's kind of the draw back to The Force Awakens. It's a victim of its own circumstances where we have lots of effects heavy films in the Superhero genre and other tangential scifi sub-genres already tumbling out of Hollwood studios, one after the other. Therefore any visual bedazzlement from The Force Awakens needs to be fairly spectacular to compete with and against the other films. Do we get that? In some respect. The effects are impressive, but the story elements they're meant to accentuate, at times, seem a bit odd. Storywise there's a real attempt to re-invent the basic story for the whole saga, taking some cues from graphic-novel story conventions. Which in turn gives the film a very 2000's kind of look and feel. The visual presentation and interweaving romantic- tension subplots is a very post 80's story telling style, of which I am not a fan. It is my opinion that the story is the story. A romance or sexual tension can be part of that story, but today is meant to run parallel to the main-story as a backdrop thread to appease those who have interests in such matters. The final summation implies that the romance is just as important as needing to defeat the bad guys or overcome the harrowing situation. And, to be brutally honest, both men and women know that that is not true in any situation where this is the setting. And ultimately this is why I liked the film as a Sunday afternoon kind of affair; couch, summer-Sunday, window open, maybe the fan running slightly in the background, maybe your dog sleeping next to you or in a cool spot of the house, and you have this thing on at a low volume as you lay back and watch it with nothing else to do. To me that's the kind of movie this is. It lacks grit, uses conventional modern Disney story telling styles to recirculate the death star plot from the 1977 feature film. And where 1977's film prepared my generation for social and personal challenges in a world that would increasingly rely on tech, this film posits more romantic and interpersonal preparation for a multi- ethnic world. To me that message is many days late and several dollars short. The exit of a major character, the under-exposition of classic characters, a reliance on a plot already used, doesn't really add up to neither an outstanding nor poor film experience, but one that just happens to be. It's almost like a social commentary on what already is, and a warning against the regurgitation of past ideologies.  My last observation is that this is aimed at the teen-aged children of the teenagers and pre-teens who saw the film way back in 1977. Which I think makes for an odd film making and directorial style, because we're not exposed to classic film making here, but someone's idea of what today's teens want to see. That includes that exit of a major character, which seemed hammy and nearly anti-climactic; i.e. no "disturbances in the force" was felt because of this. A dramatic moment that felt like a real over the top story point that had no emotional impact, as it should have.  I guess the best one could say is that if Disney had produced Star Wars, then this is the result we would get. I think that's the fairest statement anyone can make, and all that it implies. Watch at your risk, but maybe relax while doing so.Love Star Wars First of all, I love Star Wars series because it is not SF, but it describes the family relation and the problem of virtue and evil. The background is imaginary, but we have the same problem as its core theme. In Star Wars episode VII , many people discuss mainly "who is Ray? " And I think she describes the figure of every girls live this modern society. She is asked " Who are you?"by everyone, and also ask herself the same way. She cannot sure her identity, but she has strong mental power to live through life. This implies the way girls live their life . Moreover, Kylo Ren's inner weakness suggests human's weakness. His appearance seems to be very strong and evil, however, his true figure is very fragile. He cannot establish his existence and seems to have bemusement about which he belongs, "virtue or evil?". Such conflict often occurs when we live life. Anyway, I cannot wait the sequel.Okay Storyline... I think the main reason we all saw the movie was Luke Skywalker, who doesn't show up until the end of the movie...That was not the only thing, the story line to it was a little dull if you ask me. All in all the move was good. But with all that being said it was a pretty good movie with everything a movie needs. Twists in the plot such as Han Solo murdered by Kylo Ren (His Son) was a nice twist in the story, though me and my family are huge Han Solo fans it was a nice twist to the story I have to admit. If a little more effort was put into it I think it would've been a lot better. I would say I recommend this movie to people but it is out of theateres, so you should buy it on DVD if you have not seen it yet.Won This Guy Over So I'm not into big blockbuster movies normally. I prefer more cerebral, laboured, art-house indie films. I find the constant overwhelming spectacle of noise, explosions, and unrealistic worlds which derive from spinoffs of pre-existing lore, mythology, and legends exhausting and cardboard-thin. However with this iteration of Star Wars, and I don't know why the others, including the classics, never had that effect on me, it feels like there's an air of magic, and childhood wonder wrapped into it. Perhaps I'm wrong, but what I got a sense of is that every actor, creative, and person on set had a childhood reverence and excitement in them when it came to making this movie. And it doesn't matter that you will be staring at odd looking aliens, or seeing humans interact with machines in implausible ways, or that people's names, or that of planets, are sometimes outright ridiculous. It matters that, 3 minutes in, you just don't care, and end up watching the whole thing with a smile 3 miles wide. Awesome.Great for Star Wars fans.. "Meh" for film fans So what did I think of the next chapter in Star Wars? To be honest, yes, the Star Wars geek in me was yelling in excitement on the inside. I actually did tear up a little when the scrolling credits started up. So as a fan, I loved it. It has been far too long that I have been wanting to know the next story but lets be critical shall we? I was not blown away by this film as many fans (including myself) was expecting to be. I found the story a little predictable at times and cliché. I found the comedy within the movie far too Disney-esque. Something I would expect and welcome in a Marvel movie because that is what I love coming out of my favorite super heroes mouth's but Star Wars? Not so much. Also, as a Star Wars fan I was upset with the lack of light saber action. On the other end though, I enjoyed the action sequences as a whole. From the ground combat to the dogfights in the sky; Star Wars delivered and it was quite epic. The returning faces were great to see as well in their respective scenes. So again, as a whole the film brought the pain and I enjoyed the majority of it. I have waited a long time for this as a fan and it fulfilled the void in my heart for a good Star Wars film. I hope for the next installment that there is much more force and light sabers. So here's to waiting a couple years for the next one to come.The $2 Billion Reboot Episode VII in the "Star Wars" saga serves to reunite some of our favorite characters (and actors) from the very first film of 1977. Harrison Ford is back as Han Solo, as is Carrie Fisher as the Princess Leia Organa. Mark Hamill has a cameo appearance as Luke Skywalker. There are also three great new characters joining the resistance movement against the formidable First Order. They include a dynamic performance by Daisy Rider as Rey, John Boyega as Finn, and Oscar Isaac as the pilot Poe Dameron. R2-D2, C-CPO, and Chewie Chewbaca are also back! The plot of "The Force Awakens" is a virtual cookie cutter from the original "Star Wars" film with the same stages of the hero's journey. More than any other character, the central hero is the character of Rey, as she discovers the force within her to the overcome adversity of The First Order. The most dramatic scene in the film is a tension-packed meeting of father and son when Han Solo confronts his son on a bridge. Adam Driver turns in a good performance as the son, Kylo Ren, who has gone over to the other side. The meeting of father and son has Oedipal connotations exactly like the relationship of Luke and Darth Vader. For 135 minutes, this "Star Wars" film has plenty of action and lively moments, the best of which involve the sly and sassy remarks of Han Solo. Not to be missed!Not Much New Here The story is a rehash of all the episodes that went before with some exception: the Bad Guys are now called The First Order led by the Supreme Leader Snoke played by Andy Serkis. The main premise centers on finding Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) so that he cannot lead a rebellion against the First Order. Luke had gone into seclusion. The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the CGI which is again spectacular. Nothing is really new except for the young scavenger girl Rey played by Daisy Ridley and she is pretty and a breath of fresh air in a series that truly needs it.  Of course, the First Order has a weapon that uses the power of the sun to destroy the Republic led by General/Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). The main fallacy here is that had the First Order used the weapon and destroyed the Republic and didn't concentrate on finding Luke, well, that would have been that and end of story. But they didn't and well, you know the good guys -- ( Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) -- will find a way to destroy the First Order. Hey, it's in the script. (You waited on that one, eh?) There are some almost good lines between Han Solo and Chewbacca and sometimes Rey. Han Solo does comment on Princess Leia's hair (he likes it this way) that was atrocious in previous Star Wars movies. We learn that the General under Supreme Leader Snoke is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who happens to be the son of Han Solo and Princess Leia. Who knew? (I believe you fell asleep in previous stories) Yes, that is true, the never ending battles and explosions all over the galaxy have that tendency to put me into la la land. This time the battles didn't last as long and that was a good thing. Something that was disappointing was the voice of General Kylo Ren. We expected it to be more along the lines of Darth Vader back in the day. But he sounded more like a Brooklynite who happened to be in charge of Storm Troopers in the First Order. (yes, we expected something more commanding along Darth Vader's voice especially with the Mask on.) One other thing that may or may not be true, but sometimes I had the feeling that some conversations were dubbed. Could have been just me, but If one had never seen previous Star Wars movies this movie will be excellent and quite enjoyable, but for others we saw a rehash of previous versions, nothing really new and it's just the same with the good guys going after the bad guys that included spectacular CGI to include outstanding cinematography. (7/10) Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.I must the the only one to like it? OK, this is my opinion of the new Star Wars. It was a bit like a remake, but not. I wouldn't consider it a bad movie, or whatever the negative posters have been saying. I did expect better, but it was still a good movie regardless. Was cool seeing what we can do with modern technology, and was great seeing the old greats again. Great actors, except the dude that played the main badguy, just don't like that dude AT ALL.... Stupid looking, GIANT FACE with TERRIBLE acting..  Everyone else was good. Seemed like they remade the original, but added parts from others, but then changed things as well.  Was it a waste of time and money? No, not at all.. I'm happy I watched it, and excited and eager for the next one coming out in 2017. Now here comes the spoiler.. If you haven't seen it yet, STOP READING NOW!!! Seeing the Falcon was awesome.. Seeing Chewy was awesome, but he was thinner. Seeing C3p0, and R2 was awesome.. Seeing Han Solo made me happy as all heck.. Seeing Han get killed made me so upset! All in all, it was a good movie, I expected better, and more action, but I am still glad to have seen it.A reboot? Maybe not that much Star Wars is a saga that I deeply cherish, it had been following me since I was 5 years old and I still am a big fan of it. You can't imagine the excitement when I heard they were going to make a new film soon, something I literally had dreams about. I will say, I think the 3 prequels could have been much better. But onto the new installment: The force awakens. Poe Dameron (Oscar Issac), the best pilot in the resistance, was charged to find a map to locate Luke Skywalker. As the first order attacks, Poe charges the little ball droid BB-8 with the burden. Poe gets captured and BB-8 is sent roaming alone in the desert planet of Jakku. Let's begin with the main fault people find to this movie: "It looks too much like A New Hope". Yes, it has similar plot points, and I almost didn't care. Because what people seem to forget is what new stuff it brings to the table. In a new hope, I don't remember a Stormtrooper, Finn (John Boyega), deserting the imperial ranks. Vader was cool, but he never was as deep as kylo ren (Adam Driver) in the movie. I don't recall the owner of the mos eisley cantina being a 900 years old almost mystical creature. The point is, the new characters, especially Rey (Daisy Ridley) will make you forget about that critic, it has similar plot point, but I found myself not caring that much.  This movie is simple enough, but still complex. It has a basic story; a no-name woman gets the help of a few people to defeat an evil force. And like in the previous star wars movies, it works. I found it fun to have a movie that I could just enjoy and shrink down to being a kid.  Unlike the prequels, the characters seem real; they are 3 dimensional and relatable and likable. Except for one which is a little bit too much powerful, but I suppose the next films will explain some of that. Kylo Ren was a personal favorite, I have a weakness for psychotic and tormented characters, and I just can't explain it. Kylo's frequent outbursts, his inferiority complex and his fears, made him a very interesting character. Dialogues felt real and true to the characters, from Finn's clumsiness and Rey's innocence, to Poe's cockiness.  The special effects are top, there's a very good mix of practical (thank god) and CGI and everything looked real. I really loved the actions scenes, never cutting to explosions Michael bay style; JJ Abram knew how to direct our attention towards the actors while the action was unfolding around them. The cinematography was lovely. I don't know if you ever noticed in the prequels, but the shots were really boring and repetitive. But none of that here, it's much more creative. The lighting is hard to talk about, but in one scene, it mirrors the light work in the duel of episode VI and I loved it, it added a lot to the emotional factor. The soundtrack wasn't my personal favorite of the six, but was still great, just not as memorable.  It had a few problems, starkiller base (which I don't want to talk about for spoiler reasons) and one scene in particular which had too much CGI for my taste. The similarity to episode IV might annoy some people but I didn't find them distracting at all.  Go see it if you want a fun time, if you want to see fun action, likable characters and a generally good adventure movie. If someone tells you it sucked, listen to what they had to say, ask a review from themthey'll probably tell you about the similarities with ANH and a certain Mary Sue. But it was a wonderful experience, a dream come true for a fan like meI saw it 5 times. What's wrong with me?One of the worst You can no longer trust IMDB ratings. They are bought and paid for by the studios. Movie after movie is rated 8 and above and are complete disasters. This movie is like a remake by a 10 year old. Just disgusting.What the franchise needed After the painful prequel trilogy filled with bad dialogue, bad acting, bad directing and a confused narrative we get this modern day classic that will inspire a new generation of kids. It's a great movie for huge Star Wars fans like myself without being to heavy handed with the refrences. They introduce the new characters and develop them and let the old which we already know and love take a back seat. Don't listen to the negative reviews it's a great movie and lots of work was put into it and they really care about the film. It feels genuine unlike the prequels which feel artificial and the director just sat in a chair watching a screen and didn't work with the actors. If you haven't already seen it for some reason watch it!More of a remake than a sequel, it relies on nostalgia and spectacle over actual characters and story. In essence a remake of 'A New Hope' as opposed to a proper sequel, the check-box resemblance this long-awaited revival shares to its franchise's debut is genuinely uncanny and sadly staggering since this was the perfect opportunity to try something new considering that the 'Star Wars' moniker is a powerful enough box-office draw to recoup any budget, apparently no matter how exorbitant, and withstand more than a few bad apples (*cough* the prequels *cough*). What's here in 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)' is based on nothing more than nostalgia, a series of slightly sickening "remember this thing"'s and "this guy still looks the same but he's grey now"'s that become incredibly tiresome increasingly quickly. If you take away the franchise underlayer you're just left with a hollow, characterless piece that gives you no reason to care and very little actual information despite all its endless exposition. In the end, I was honestly bored even during all of its high-flying fanfare. 5/10HORRIBLE I loved the original Star Wars movies but this was WRETCHED! The storyline was as slow and shaky as 75yr old Harrison Ford trying to run around like an action hero. PAINFUL to watch. Equally painful to see John Boyega try to act. Boyega and Ridley were TERRIBLE in their attempts at fight scenes that went on forever without a purpose or expertise.George Lucas made something for art, imagination and hope Disney bought it from the sell-out (older and richer) Lucas and transforms Disney here into the usual Hollywood dreck riddled and burdened with remakes, reboots, reloads. The sad part about this inferior remake is that all the living actors decided to take the 66% (33% goes to their greedy agents) and show up. Legacy? Integrity? Dignity? Nope, nada zilch none of that. Everyone of them showed up and joined George Lucas in going from legends to money grubbing Hollywood cash grabber. Disney playing the lord of capitalist sith bought loyalty, contributed nothing to the lore of Star Wars and now will use tools JJ Abrams to for years issue crap like this. What is funny is that you read statements like 'Disney confirms there will be three new Star Wars movies.' Really?? Was there ever any doubt that they will milk this until the stone bleeds the last cent for decades to come with Star Wars completely destroyed and irrelevant. And there will be no heroes.Everyone is a sell-out or the typical right-wing corporatist prostitute. RIP Star Wars (1977-1983)Didn't think it could possibly be this bad! Didn't think it could possibly be this bad! It was.JJ Did It! JJ Abrams nailed it. The movie had extremely high expectations. Considering the hype, I would say I was satisfied. The visuals were very well done and did not make your head spin (like most high speed CG movies today). Daisy and Boyega performed very well and I look forward to their performance in next installment of the franchise. But the best part to me was the background score. It really evoked the feeling of pure joy that the prequels could not. Watch the trailer again after seeing the film and you will be amazed at how cleverly they managed to keep the film under the wraps. Great end to a stellar year Hollywood. Good on you."Star Wars: The Force Awakens" is ultimately a collection of counterparts and equivalents. Thirty years after the defeat of Emperor Palpatine and the Galactic Empire, a new threat has arisen to once again bring terror and destruction to the galaxy. The self-proclaimed "First Order" military force, led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and the mysterious Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), strategically conspires to attack the Republic to regain their former glory. But when conflicted stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) disobeys his murderous orders to instead aid in the escape of Resistance fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), he sets in motion a cataclysmic battle between good and evil that will bring him face to face with a pretty scavenger (Daisy Ridley), a vicious Dark Jedi, and a legendary duo from the past. It's just not quite the same without the Twentieth Century Fox fanfare prior to the now unmistakable line, "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away" Nevertheless, John Williams' thunderous theme music and the yellow scrolling text instantly put the viewer back into that nostalgic territory of what George Lucas started back in 1977. This new chapter is, in large part, an attempt to undo what Lucas then did to the franchise with his staggeringly mediocre prequel trilogy, which itself felt like an opportunistic endeavor rather than a passionate work of art. "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" is ultimately a collection of counterparts and equivalents. The more the filmmakers attempt to recreate the substance of the original three pictures, the more it negates its own reason for existence. To its credit, most of the imagery and sound effects and character designs do possess an aura of authenticity when compared directly to the former vision (almost as if this project commenced around 1986, keeping up with the three-year gaps). But in sticking to so many familiar elements, the project forgot to craft its own identity; it's unmistakably reminiscent of a remake. From the blaster fire, to the massive Star Destroyers crossing star-speckled skies, to the rubbery alien faces populating desert communities, to the black-cloaked villain stepping from his transport, to the droids rolling and chirping about, so much of this undertaking is recycled. Director J.J. Abrams would insist that all of the similarities are nods or homage, but by the time the heavily-secreted plot is revealed, it's entirely obvious that no new story is awaiting to unfold. Damsels in distress, familial betrayals, roguish pilots engaging in daredevil maneuvers, planet-destroying weapons, good versus evil, and vastly outnumbered rebels proposing speculative plans to blow things up, all return in spades, but without the inspiration needed to demonstrate something novel or impactful. However, a dash of blood here and there appears generally unconventional. "I've got a bad feeling about this." The dialogue also conforms to the mood and tone of the '77 classic, plucking snippets from the prior six episodes to such a great degree that it's possible the whole screenplay does not contain a single line of fresh material. And the storyline once again starts in the middle of a middle (not unlike "The Empire Strikes Back"), recognizing that, certainly not serving as a standalone entry, this enterprise will be best appreciated by longtime fans. It's also under the impression that audiences require constant action, as it creates a static level of nonstop tumult in which no single sequence has the chance to stand out. But in the end, though it may have lost a good portion of the magic, every so often, when an iconic component or character makes a grandiose appearance (and there are plenty of notable arrivals), it's difficult not to revel in the experience of witnessing a familiar cast wield the Force and do battle against the Dark Side - the right way and for the first time in over 30 years.  The Massie Twins A (near) perfect synthesis of old and new. This FEELS like Star Wars! This movie hits every conceivable emotion, but above all, it's fun. Nowadays, we have so much dark gritty stuff which is great and deep, but it gets tiring. And, things that try to be fun come off as overly silly and dumbed down. The Force Awakens does something not many films have done successfully in a while; combine the two seamlessly into one balanced package. The prequels tried to do this, and it blew up in Lucas' face. The reason it works in this movie is that all the humour and drama comes naturally from the characters. Yes, the plot and beats are VERY similar to A New Hope, but that was a great movie. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Besides, that's exactly what's been missing from movies lately. So don't listen to all these negative reviewers saying "it's a remake", or a "rip-off". Towards the end, it goes completely its own way becoming more like The Empire Strikes Back. Let's start with the characters. It's great to see the old characters back in action. The Han and Leia scenes could have easily felt like they were just in there for nostalgia factor, but they feel natural and factor into the plot. Given the vast number of characters, it's amazing how very few of them feel shoe-horned in. There are three that I can think of who did, but all three of them are confirmed to be in the next one, so I'll get my fix then. However, the real standouts are the new characters. Adam Driver brings unexpected depth to Kylo Ren. Oscar Isaac is intensely likable as Poe Dameron. John Boyega is great as Finn. But the best is Daisy Ridley as Rey. She is going to be in so much more stuff, I guarantee. The chemistry between her and Finn was one of my favourite parts of the movie. The cinematography is incredible. The camera never moved around in the originals. Here, it follows around the action, capturing the feeling of playing with toys as a kid more perfectly than any movie before. It also just feels so much like Star Wars. Every sound and image is familiar. The movie has a real presence; the practical effects make it feel real. John Williams' new score is great, of course. He does a great job integrating the old with the new. In fact, that would be my summary of the movie. It pays enough homage to the original while setting up an exciting new story. I like how not everything is revealed by the end of this film. The final shot perfectly sums up all the questions we are left with and foreshadows what to come. It may be one of my favourite final shots of a movie ever. In conclusion, some people are going to hate on it for being too much like the originals, others are going to complain that it's not enough like them. Some will say too many questions were answered, others will say that not enough were. In the end, there are so many expectations riding on this film that it will never live up to everyone's hype. It's a minor miracle what JJ did. He had to bring in all of the old, set up a sprawling galaxy of new, establish what's been going on for 30 years between films, add humour, add drama, and somehow make it cohesive and fun. If you go in with the understanding that this is a movie, not the second coming, you will leave immensely satisfied.amazing return to the star wars universe We've waited.... and waited..... and here it is! The Force Awakens is everything we've come to love about Star Wars. It's big, it's epic, it's spectacular. And underneath, there's actually a big heart to it all. You get a sense from watching it, that it was made by true fans of the series. I won't give away any real spoilers- but rest assured Jar Jar Binks does not put in an appearance, so remain calm.  The good guys are very likable, I thought the relationship between Ray and Finn worked out very well. It gave the film it's emotional anchor.  The villains are pretty much what you would expect, but the filmmakers threw in a few twists about them that were interesting.  Add some terrific battle sequences, and you get a very welcome return to the greatness of Star Wars. Go and see it (but you already know you will). Take a friend or a family member. You'll have a great time. Because that's what these films are about when it comes down to it.  Overall, Force Awakens shows off some snazzy visual effects combined with a compelling story and great characters. It won't disappoint.mediocre Well, the first part of the movie is about ... the main protagonists meeting and then separating and meeting again. It really has this Harry Potter taste to it. It makes you want to feel that these characters are connected, but if they are it doesn't happen in this movie. The other part consists of pretty shots of dead spaceships in da desert and some terribly plastic epic moments of returning actors.  Which brings to the next point and it must be said; were dropped 30 years in the future with no clue as to what happened and no explanation of the current situation. Leia just appears almost solely to reinforce the feeling of continuation between the new and old cast, but we don't know anything of what she did in the last 30 years. Even worst for the antagonists. The 'new emperor' is a giant alien being with a terrible scar on his face. No explanation on who he is or how he got there. totally random. As for his apprentice, or the main villein for this movie he might as well be called Darth Malfoy or Darth Twilight. He is somewhat fragile, week, needy and maybe just a tad creepy and sneaky but that is really all that Adam Driver has to say in the movie. more on him later. Perhaps the worst part is the second half of the movie. At first, when they discuss their mission in the command room in the typical star wars pre battle briefing, I thought it was actually a joke. But no, they really have to destroy the deathstar, again, only this time its 10 times bigger. thats it. So basically the plot is harry potter meets a new hope. Going back to the antagonists, (because lets say it, the traitor stormtrooper, the lady skywalker and the ace pilot aren't particularly extravagant tropes) the big bad giant without a name, of a never seen before race whose rise to power has no explanation is just really a mass of pixels with 2 or 3 lines in the movie. His apprentice? is just a pig puzzle of... indecision. His attempt to seduce Rey to the dark side is.. laughable... and out of the blue.. just felt like it was added to the dialogue 'cos thats what star wars is'.  This movie is a mess, and the stunts were better in the later 3 episodes by Lucas. Not to mention, Most of the locations of this movie are real places on earth. Sand, Snow, and Iceland type islands. So much for the space opera.  Last but not least. Someone said this movie was witty... he's being paid to say so... It had none of the good humor some of the recent Disney movies had (lone ranger - john carter) the jokes and I laughed one or two times during the whole pic. The audience seemed to agree with me, no one was particularly exited on their way out, sure, it was almost 3 am Finally, the plot twist in the movie is ... 1) you know its coming 5 minutes before it happens. 2) It feels like they just did it to a) not have to deal with him anymore b) cos he wanted it since episode 5 c) to make a similarity with Obi One's death from a new hope (as if they alrady didn't take enough of that movies plot into this one..) BAH!...Felt like a Star Wars movie, But left me with a sense of disappointment *Spoilers* For months I've this movie has been hyped up, and as I stood in a queue that looked like it had neither a beginning nor end, I was buzzing with excitement like every other person in the queue. When STAR WARS flashed across the screen with the accompanying music that is universally known, I settled myself in for what was sure to be the best Star Wars movie yet....right? While the movie itself was very good, hence the 7/10 rating, there was something amiss. Everything was going great at the start, you're introduced to these fresh new characters that you know nothing about, but you're eager to learn everything about them, and by the time the movie finished, you knew that one of these would be your favorite, that you would emotionally connect with that character more than any other. But by the end of the movie, the only new character I can say that I felt the slightest bit emotionally connected to was BB-8. it had nothing to do with with the acting, which was actually rather good (with the exception of a certain princess/general and at times, kylo ren). no, the issue was you didn't know enough about the characters to feel emotionally invested in them. you get very little back-story on our new heroes/villains, and when you do, it is generally quite vague, I guess it helps the movie move a little faster, but would it hurt to sit the characters down for 5 minutes or so and actually explain to us who these characters really are? But they're saving that for the next movie some people might say, well that's fair enough, but I hope to god that it's worth waiting 2 years for. and lets not even start on characters that were probably just thrown in so Disney could put a name to the toy cough*Phasma*cough. The plot seemed awfully familiar (a new hope anyone?) and there were certain things that annoyed the s*** out of me. for example, the storm trooper that decided to desert, and now all of a sudden he can shoot straight, and he's able to go one on one with a reasonably trained sith for a good 5 minutes or so (regular storm trooper would last 5 seconds). and lets not mention the fact that rey suddenly turned into a jedi master, with no yoda. *major spoiler* I think the worst part for me was the death of Han Solo, I thought it was brilliant that he was killed off, don't get me wrong, I love the guy, but it's that shock factor and urge to cry that makes it so brilliant, if Finn had been killed, people probably wouldn't have been that bothered. No, the part that bothered me so much, was when Rey, Chewie and Finn returned to the resistance base, Leia sought solace over the loss of Han (she did't look too bothered tbh) with Rey, someone she has barely known for 5 minutes, while Chewie is left to mourn the loss of his best friend of more than 30 years on his own, not even a pat on the head for the guy, I mean come on. and where was the funeral? a last dignified goodbye for the guy we've wanted to be since we were kids. Vader got one, even Qui-gon got one. "He might still be alive" some might say. don't be so stupid, the guys in his 60's for crying out loud. he got impaled and got thrown overboard emperor style. falling down the last couple of stairs would have finished him off. To conclude, as much as I've ripped on it, it was still a very enjoyable movie. would I watch it again? yes. would i watch it dozens of times like previous star wars? probably not. Rant overStar Wars Awakens After thinking about the films for several hours after seeing it, and being initially disappointed. I can say that Star Wars the Force Awakens is well crafted film that captures the spirit of the original trilogy very well. The new cast members all perform well and create a new set of heroes and villains. Older cast members are also great especially Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Daisy Ridley as Rey. The film moves along at pace, similar to the first Star Wars film and is essentially a chase movie for the first hour of its run time. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is an interesting villain, which has conflicting issues to deal with, and is quite a nut case that has hissy fits. My main gripe with the film is the plot line of the Starkiller base, being too similar to the death star of the original trilogy. There was really no need for this plot line, just having Kylo Ren looking for Luke Skywalker was enough. Also would the rebellion not of known about the creation of such a base well before its construction? I also feel that Luke Skywalker would not abandon His truest friends, I do understand there is a lot gone on since Return of the Jedi that could of driven a wedge between their friendships. Luke however would of sensed what was going on with signals in the force and surely of helped, I feel his appearance was purely to set up the next film. Although the resistance claims victory it feels like a subdued win because of events of the attack on the Star killer base. The action is well filmed and the lightsaber battles are raw and feel dangerous. Overall this is a good film and a return to the film making beats of the original trilogy. It had unachievable hype to live up too, but the mix of old and new bond well, it is exciting to see what happens next in the Star Wars Saga....This movie awakens that good ol' feeling Finally there is a new Star Wars movie. This movie is easy to sum up without spoiling it. It is a roller-coaster ride throughout the whole movie. And yes, there are (a lot) of elements that summon a déjà vu. But those elements made us fall in love with Star Wars in the first place and once again it made me fall in love with "The Force Awakens". I saw it yesterday in IMAX and I am still shaking. This is my first review because I owe it to JJ. I just want to let people know to go and watch this. And form your own opinion! Don't let negative people influence your judgment...Pessimism is a path to the dark side. Stay true and may the Force be with you.It's Our Fault, We Asked For This! After 10 years - or 32, depending on your regard for the legitimacy of the prequel trilogy - Star Wars is back, and, in the spirit of times, as Giuseppe DI Lampedusa would have put it, it was necessary for everything to change in order for it to remain the same: new studio, new team, new characters... new expanded universe even (more on that later). It's funny then, and sadly not at all surprising, that so many things remain the same as in 1977. The Empire has survived, in the form the The First Order, and the rebellion is now the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa. A soul-searching stormtrooper (Boyega) saves ace resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Isaac) and important info stored in a droid and stages an escape to a desolate desert planet... Well, if echoes of Episode IV are already a bit startling, it gets worse. It quickly becomes clear why so many directors turned down this dream assignment, as Episode VII isn't as much a chance to play in George Lucas' sandbox as a remake of his original opus. Blame Disney. Blame J. J. Abrahms, he's certainly done this before... the fault, it turns out, is yours. After the dismal prequels, chock-block of new ideas, some good, some bad, most of them executed horribly, we've howled for movies that resembled the originals more that Disney would have been suicidal to approve anything more original than this, and history will judge Episode VII on how much it emboldens the studio to be more daring, or whether it just confirms the need to just "give fans what they want", more of the same. Time will tell, but, to quote our heroes, I have a bad feeling about this. What is annoying this time, after the utter cluelessness of Episodes I-III, is the very real talent on display here. The old characters could have stood silently in the background, paychecks safely cashed, but they make a mark, particularly Harrison Ford as Solo, more touching and involved here than he has been for at least a decade. The new characters are just as involving and appealing, particularly John Boyega's Finn and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. Andy Serkis also makes an impression. Otherwise, the humor is back and it's a thrill to see J.J. Abrams work a scene after the inane telenovela-like blocking of the prequels. And still, this could have been much more, and our only consolation will have to be that it could have also been worse. The greatest question is, what comes next? Tonally, we are squarely back in original trilogy mode, the only limit will be the appeal of the characters (mostly successful here) and the caliber of the stories (not so much). It is a bit worrying that Disney has jettisoned all the expanded universe, both because it might set an ugly precedent, and because it does show a fear of risk and cynical approach to a very valuable brand.  And yet... we might be wrong: what little transparency has been displayed so far might be completely honest. It was George Lucas himself who, in an interview, said Disney had rejected all his outlines saying that they wanted to make "one for the fans". Well, this describes Episode VII perfectly. If we could have some fresh ideas with our next helping, we'd truly be thrilled.Don't listen to the haters! It's a shame to see so many people complaining about how similar this was to episode IV and how it feels simply like a reboot. Maybe there are points where the homage becomes extreme, but it still ticks almost all the boxes of a movie-goer. The film itself looks and feels amazing, with all the touches of old, including numerous new and old aliens lurking in the background to give it that classic star wars universe feel. Obviously as in any film there are ways you could pick at it, maybe the humour is excessive? Maybe it could be more original? But at the end of the day it will leave you laughing, crying and cheering, all in good measure. Star Wars is back with a bang, and episode VII makes it feel like it's never really been gone.Boycott the new Star Wars movie! I've never asked for my money back for any movie in my life until know! Without ruining the movie for anyone... the main start is a female Jedi (Rey) which had her usually passive aggressive attitude towards all men (Feminist behaviour) and "I can look after myself." I was going to walk out until Harrison Ford made an entrance and played his alpha self. Of course Rey comes along and tells Harrison Ford how to run his ship for him! You can see him wanting to tell her to shut the %@#$ up but her pulls out his Feminist agenda card cause he doesn't want to be ridiculed by the Galaxy media and lose his job! The bad guy was great for only 5 mins but after running into Rey he turns into a major beta just like the storm trooper Finn. I was a star wars fan until now! Everything that was star wars is in my bin now! If you want to see a bullshit "woman in power" and all men bowing down to her, go see the new Star Wars!Something, something, something, dark side. Something, something, something, complete It's as if millions of Star Wars fans suddenly cried out in criticism and were suddenly silenced – as that's the effect this movie should have on most (other than those fanatics who were bound to be disappointed/hate it no matter what). For all the SANE Star Wars fans out there, I'm happy to report that the Force is strong with this series once again (after taking a walk on the dark side with the prequels). All other shoddy imitations take note – THIS is how you do a space opera. The Force Awakens possesses everything that was missing from the soulless prequels – we have a non-snooze-worthy storyline, likable new characters, great acting, non-cringe-worthy dialogue and not such a reliance on only CGI effects/green-screen. The pluses of this movie are in abundance, starting with what's new. All those with reservations about the fresh young actors cast to play new characters Rey and Finn should sit back, relax and watch the beautiful chemistry between the two as their characters form a friendship/dynamic on screen (which they also seem to share off- screen) that rivals that of the original trio. Daisy Ridley more than proves she's up to the challenge of letting a large portion of the new trilogy rest on her shoulders. Her Rey is a scavenger with a good heart (as evidenced by her coming to the rescue of BB-8, a droid carrying something important on him). Whilst certain people (who for some unfathomable reason don't like seeing a woman who can handle herself) may take this new female lead (who is smart, brave, kind and just all around awesome) as a personal affront to them, for the rest of us who *don't* hate seeing a woman take centre stage, this is what we've been looking for in a female character for so long. She's everything you could hope for...but not without her faults, as she does make occasional mistakes – but not enough you hate her for it. She's flawed, but SO much more interesting because of this. Ridley imbues her character with so much heart and soul, conveys a lot with just looks and even shows she's adept at humour as well. Most importantly, she's likable, forming instant friendship with other characters who we already like (so we know she's awesome). Any gripes about her would be for petty reasons/nitpick-y. Sharing her responsibility of being one of the new faces of this trilogy is John Boyega as Finn – a former Stormtooper who refuses to go along with the rest when he witnesses them do something terrible. It's after this that he meets Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron, who he forms an almost-immediate friendship with. Out of the three new leads, Isaac's Poe is probably given the least development, but he manages to make it believable that he and Finn become close friends in such a short space of time. The best dynamic, though, is without a doubt the one formed between Rey and Finn. The way they play off each other with such ease is thanks in large parts to the actors, but also the dialogue is snappy and quick-witted. They share a fun friendship that becomes quite close, but is always believable due to the actors truly inhabiting their roles/believing in who they're playing as well as the universe they're a part of (where characters talk/act in a unique way). One of many things the prequels sadly lacked was heart, but this movie/these characters have it in spades. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren picks up where Darth Vader left off as our main villain this time around and is clearly devoted to his memory (since he talks to the burnt mask of him, as seen in the trailers). Driver is quite good at playing the bad guy, though he is prone to the occasional 'hissy fit' with his crossguard lightsaber which verges into slightly over-the-top/petulant teenager behavior. Thankfully, when the big moments occur, Driver shows real emotion/conflict within his character. His lightsaber duel, first with Finn and then Rey, is everything the prequel duels were lacking. They may've had the needless fancy twirling and whatnot, but here we have rough and tumble, gritty fights between someone skilled and two people who are only just learning what they're capable of. Plus there's real emotional investment, which helps. It's an epic battle with tension – which is a BIG plus with this movie: we don't know what's going to happen. Of course it's good to see our old favourites back. Han, Chewie, Leia, R2-D2, C-3PO, even the Millennium Falcon – all of these received applause at my screening. Those claiming this film relies on nostalgia/good will towards the original films alone are mistaken. Whilst the prequels included familiar characters/moments just for the sake of callbacks, what they do here is much more satisfying. Han's his usual charming, funny, "scruffy-looking nerf-herder" self, but he forms attachments to our new characters, and his dynamics with them allows for some of the film's best moments. The movie certainly has humour, but thankfully it's not the "cutsie" nauseating variety found in the prequels. There's genuinely funny moments for young and old alike.  J.J. Abrams has been unfairly criticised, when he should be receiving thanks for bringing the Star Wars Saga back from the brink/re-energising it after the prequels. So what if there's some familiarity? My only quibbles were Domhnall Gleeson's shouting/performance, the somewhat hit-and-miss soundtrack, and Andy Serkis' CGI Supreme Leader Snoke - since, in most other instances, Abrams ensured that (along with story/character development) locations/miniatures/practical effects and make-up took precedence over a reliance on CGI/things that simply 'looked cool'. The sequels have their work cut out for them in matching this thrilling/exciting, enjoyable and satisfying first chapter of a new era in the saga, but if this film's anything to go by, the next two should be safe in the hands. Finally, we have a new hope. What more could anyone (without impossible standards) wish for?Good Movie! Dumb Reviews! Okay, I'm coming straight off the bat and saying that this was a really entertaining movie - period. It's not perfect but it is definitely an excellent film with lots of great aspects. The acting, screenplay, directing were all well above average (especially when you consider how terrible the prequels were). It had a wonderful sense of fun and borrowed a bit from it's predecessors (I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing as the originals were awesome). I felt it was a worthy successor to the original Star Wars movies. I have literally waited a lifetime to see what would happen after episode six and I wasn't disappointed. That is a huge achievement in itself. And better yet it has helped rid me of the painful memories of Mr Lucas trying to ruin the originals by 'updating' them and of course, those God awful prequels. I felt this movie was strongest in the first and last thirds of the film with the middle being a tad clunky. That being said I am not complaining. Actually the only thing I will complain about is some of the reviews I read on IMDb this morning. What kind of an idiot could sit through this movie and then only give it one star! I believe everyone has the right to an opinion but seriously, some reviewers here are completely off the mark. If a movie has a bad script or painful acting (like the prequels or The Room) by all means crucify it in your review. But if a movie has a good level of humour, interesting characters, a good tempo, a plot, solid acting, a little bit of intrigue, then don't review it poorly just because you can. I would go so far as to say that anyone who has given a review with below five stars for this movie has no idea what constitutes a good movie and should be ignored. My little rant over, I'll just say this movie was a worthy addition to the Star Wars universe (or multiverse now that the books don't count). I left the movie last night feeling very emotional as one of my childhood dreams had finally come to fruition. I hope when you see it you feel like I did and that you don't get put off by people with no idea about how to review a film.Surrogate Star Wars: Competent but shallow trope-fest fails to recapture magic of originals There is an essence of Star Wars that has made it more than just a film, but rather the dominant myth of our culture. That is the promise of adventure, the depth of its world, and the resonance of its central drama and spiritual struggle. All these can transcend shoddy dialogue, pat storytelling, and intermittent tonal missteps. With its evocative title, in the opening scenes The Force Awakens promises to rediscover the magic, if mainly because these are new characters in fresh settings. The interaction between the winsome Boyega, Ridley and BB8, while basic, is spirited, and the still- masked Kylo Ren promises to be a nuanced, powerful presence. An entire galaxy awaits. But the moment Harrison Ford walks into the Millennium Falcon – to applause of recognition from the first-night audience - all the possibilities are extinguished.  Suddenly, we are watching an unsolicited tag-on to a story that has already been told. What were once heroes in their prime going through the most vital moments of their lives, are now physically unconvincing pensioners, caked in make-up and CGI, reliving them in a manner that appears forced, sorry, and vaguely undignified. The protagonists of the original trilogy could have been an alluring myth on the outskirts of the narrative, or shuttled in for an effective cameo – nostalgic or heroic – but placing them at the heart of the new film constricts and misshapes it. With Han, Leia and Luke on-board, the plot sets a familiar course, though having to accommodate both old and new protagonists and stories within the scope of one film, the pacing and structure are often jumpy, and the set ups and payoffs lack dramatic weight. More generally, with its endless inter-generational family dramas and ever-bigger Death Stars to be destroyed through the exploitation of an engineering vulnerability, the main storyline of Star Wars risks collapsing into self-parody. A scene such as Kylo Ren praying to the desiccated helmet of Darth Vader, is written to summon a chill of history, and gasps of awe, but could as easily elicit pretension- bursting laughter. Yet the film's creators do not shy away from the tropes, but embrace them. George Lucas – he of the "rhyming stanzas" – could claim proud ownership of the tiresome symmetries, plot recycling and continuity porn of The Force Awakens. But Chewbacca, cantinas, solo enemy base escapes, the Millennium Falcon do not bring back the feeling of Star Wars, and instead every new laboured coincidence introducing familiar elements only makes the galaxy seem smaller, and diminishes that lure of the unknown that made the original trilogy what it is. But the new elements the makers of The Force Awakens have brought to the saga also show that they appear to have an unsteady grasp of the fundamental appeal of the old films. Formally, director JJ Abrams studiously avoids the CGI-heavy feel of Episodes I to III, replicating the physical presence of the originals. Yet he also adds a gloss and a busyness to the proceedings that strips Star Wars of its depth, something Lucas always strove towards, even when he was unable to skilfully establish it. We visit several worlds, but there is little wonder, as plot dominates over atmosphere. There is no time for binary sunsets, or the swamps of Dagobah here, and as a result world of the film seems shallower, almost consciously so, with greater emphasis on the diet of wisecracks and blaster shots. In fact, the unpropitious mix of the old and the new, brings nothing so much to mind as fan fiction, or a lesser Star Wars game. The film seems over-familiar and full of fanservice, but also strangely "off" – off-brand and off-kilter - parsecs away from the authentic soul of the saga.  As an experience, The Force Awakens is not unenjoyable, though it seems less fun the longer it goes on, and those fans enthusiastically cheering every familiar object in the first half, gave only a half-hearted smattering of applause at the end. But it fails, and barely tries to live up to the promise of Star Wars. Heavy narrative baggage, and endless outside commercial and production considerations do not necessarily align with making the best Star Wars movie possible. And while it is evident that the film was made with painstaking effort, the restrictions those behind it placed on themselves were too great to craft an enchanting new story. The makers of The Force Awakens will see it as transitional episode, and hope that the young characters will truly take flight in the next episode and beyond, but the tractor beam of the past may be too strong, and their thrusters too underpowered.This is a big let down but why are we surprised? Where to start from? I do not even know how to explain this film. Let me first say that I am one of the BIGGEST fans of Star Wars. I even like Jar Jar... but this, this is not Jar jar, this is not even star wars. This is some space film with star wars characters in it... I cannot call it a remake, because a remake is something that duplicates the old one trying to make it look better. It would of been actually nice if they had made a remake. Ohhh Disney we would buy your toys anyway, no need for this type of rubbish. OK too much negativism... Let me actually do a proper review.. I am just too disappointed. Now positives: 1. I liked the main characters (Fin and Rey) 2. I love that the old characters were in there although we saw Luke only for a minute. Why was he not in the trailer.. The answer is because he was not in this movie, he was reserved for the next one. 3. CGI was good, not the best but still good. 4. Costumes were first-class. 5. Camera was good... 6. The cast was good, I liked the actors chosen for this film, apart from the villains but this is for the negative bits of the review. 7. It is called Star Wars and Han is there as well ... 8. Mystery .Who is who? I think this is pretty much all the positive stuff in this film...  Negatives:  1. Villains are a joke ...One ugly, funny looking supreme leader and a Sith lord with big ears, childish looking and funny Robot mask that must change the voice. Ohh I want to be like my grandfather... But i will never be... Ohh man i can go on and on...  2. 30 X fighters take on a 100000 bad ass space ships and actually win... it was fine for 1977 but its a bit too much to repeat the story again and say it is a brand new.story.. As i said we cannot call it a remake 3. We want more Jedi stuff and more light saber fights ... And please just please Disney do not ever use this Cross light saber that looks more like I made it myself type of light saber...  4. NOW IMPORTANT THING ... Where the hell is the story... Seriously ... a droid keeping secret that is not of any use because R2 D2 is hibernating... then a storm trooper who wants to be a good guy and also falls in love with a Jedi wanna be... A brother and sister (Rey) and The funny mask guy ... but we still do not know that and we do not know how are they related... Then she is waiting for her family but they are never coming back.. she never had a Jedi training but yet again she nearly killed an experienced Sith Lord. Ohh well he was injured but who cares he is trained for this S..t!!! OK they wanted to leave many questions for the next film but this is not the way to do so. There are much clever ways of doing it... Like stating the obvious but leaving it open so the audience can only guess. This is boldly stupid... Like i do not know that Luke is going to train her... and that funny alien looking villain wanna be will take that funny mask guy to finish off his training... Chubaka is going to be Rey's right hand ... Luke is going to die at some point but he is very powerful.. Leia is realising this little girl is her daughter ... The storm trooper is madly truly and deeply in love with her ... Oh they might add the twist and she might fall in love with the pilot instead and feel the black dude more of a brother instead.... Guys you could of build up the story and leave the action for the next episode.  5. The death of Han Solo... Guys please ... How the hell did you even allow this to happen.. Killed by his son on some stupid bridge with a cross light saber that he is holding... No proper conversation, no explanation ... just... OH let me stab my dad and let him fly off the bridge ... nicely. after 6 episodes we decide to kill one of the most lovable characters without even leaving him the chance to fight... Ohh yeah this is because he would never fight his ugly big eared son... Pathetic ... Then Leia felt it .. R2 D2 also felt it and woke up... Nice ..... Luke is just chilling out on a funny rocky planet ... Meditating ...  6. Everyone is looking for Luke ... wow nice ... So what would happen if they find him.. Kill him? Kiss him? Ohh wait turn him into the dark side... Or the funny alien wants to fight him... Well good luck with that.  7. The republic (Why the hell did you destroy the republic so easy) Seriously guys this is even out of order. I am tired of giving negative feedback. There is so much more that I can say about this film. You guessed it folks I won't do it. Just because I love Star Wars all 6 of them even the first one. Do you know why? Because there is story, it is original and there is everything that we need, although not as good as the old 3 films still Star Wars. Out of respect I give 2 stars. Will I watch this again, probably not. Will i watch the next one. Yes I will but I will not have such high expectations. We all know how this ends.There has been an awakening... Spoilers within. The first words out of Han Solo's mouth are "Chewie, we're home". And I think that The Force Awakens has made me feel the same way, against all the odds. The world of Jakku is immediately familiar to all those who watched Luke gaze at the twin suns of Tattoine for the first time in 1977. There are some gorgeous shots of unspeakable scale of a decayed Death Star lying in the desert sands that immediately speak 'aged future' much like the original trilogy did. And the scavenger in Rey, played with moxie and endearing ferocity by Daisy Ridley, reminds me of a similar explorer, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. She too explores the husk of a broken, long forgotten world.  The plot too is familiar, perhaps overly so, by Lawrence Kaskan. Once again the Jedi have faded into mystery, and the Empire has manifested into yet another legion ruling over the systems with its might. The opening scrawl is less impressive and otherworldly as it once was with this in mind. We have another Vader, another Han Solo, another secret Sith master who hides in the shadows and speaks of vague evils...and as we close, we search for another Jedi master much like Luke did for Yoda. And there is another gigantic Death Star needing to be exploded in spectacular fashion.  It is then with futility that Han Solo bids his goodbye to Star Wars. He falls in an identical manner to Obi Wan, with friends desperately onlooking, and cut down by someone close who has given way to the dark side. This is troubling because not only is Kylo Ren played unconvincingly, where his most vulnerable moments without his helmet give way to the plain face of Adam Driver, spouting a boy band haircut and shouting of the Dark Side without much actual justification for why he defected, but also because it veers dangerously close to the same redemption path of Vader himself. To redo that story with a fraction of the conflict and without a hint of backstory would be unsatisfying.  He does not have the backing power of the Imperial March theme as Vader once did, but demonstrates his terror in other ways. The sound design and visual and special effects are fantastic as expected. The first showing of the force suspends a blaster beam in mid-air, and the lightsabers make the entire frame tremble, and fills the theatre with that unmistakable hum, buzzing and crackling with deadly red force. Overhead, entire planets are destroyed without mercy. The markets of Jakku and the watering rebel hole are created with ease, although with nothing as iconic as the Cantina Band. Less impressive is the JJ Abrams method of obscuring his action scenes with his trademark smoke and sparks that seem pervasive throughout the galaxy. Like his Mission Impossible movies, sparks are literally everywhere a fight occurs, even as lightsabers cut up frozen trees and blasters are fired at rocks and dirt. As the Millennium Falcon takes flight, whip pans and shaky-cam are a tad overused. At times, the action is rendered unwatchable.  The best performance is Ridley's Rey, who is tough and vulnerable and capable. Joining her is Boyega's Finn, whose story arc is natural (maybe made a little ridiculous when blood is smeared on a stormtrooper's helmet, which are newer and sleeker but still not a substitute for an actual face) and whose comedic timing and chemistry with his co-star make them very easy to root for. Equally as good is BB-8, who brings the same charm and humour to the group much like R2D2 originally did. Isaac's Poe is charismatic enough, although no Han Solo. The worst belong to Christie's Phasma, whom is given as many lines as Boba Fett, and an imposing shiny suit, but never so much as fires a blaster and is irrelevant. Gleeson's Hux is also forgetful, save for a riveting speech to his battalions where his face quivers with maniacal anticipation and bloodlust. And it seems that Supreme Leader Snoke is overcompensating with big evil dialogue and a transmitter that portrays him as towering and monstrous. Ah yes, he is finally going to complete his training. Never heard that one before. I got chills as the iconic score and scrawl opened the movie, and I very much want to see it again. I think that is the most important thing with Star Wars.The Force Awakens captures the Spirit and Magic of Star Wars In a galaxy far, far away Star Wars. It's about time we should see that opening to a film. 10 years since the last Star Wars Film, J.J Abrams takes the time to get it right. And he does it perfectly. I won't say anything about the plot, because I'm sure you want to find what it is yourself. But I will tell you of a New, Epic Adventure.  The Force Awakens gets it right. It blends old and new together in a way the prequel Trilogy really failed to do. We had new characters( Finn, Rey, Poe, Kylo Ren, BB-8) and old ( Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, C3PO, R2-D2), that combined together to make a fitting and suitable Stars Wars film that would make George Lucas Proud. The Force Awakens doesn't make the mistake of copying everything awesome about the original trilogy, but it respects and honours it. It makes its only original story, and it really is quite a great story. But that's enough of me, I think you would rather see this Fantastic Film then listen to me ramble on about itFresh and as exciting as watching the first Star Wars 38 Years Ago Just from a packed first showing @ 12:01 am in Exeter, UK of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (in 3D). Remarkably I saw the first in 1977 on a first showing, and subsequent ones in between. Probably makes me a geek &amp; definitely a Star Wars fan, however I did go to this viewing with some trepidation. New director, main characters, different studio.... could they keep it fresh and maintain the well worked recipe of success the previous six, George Lucas had conjured up? The answer is J. J. Abrams &amp; crew produced a total success,obviously created with love and affection of watching previous versions. Great story with continuity of the Star Wars saga, new graphics / CGI, but with a perfect blend of old characters with new, yet the familiar Star Wars places and technology. A must see on the big screen, especially in 3d, for young and old whether a fan of the previous films or not. I can guarantee no one will be bored. Thanks Disney, and will book for a first showing for the follow up. Next year?Disappointing I don't even know where to start with this. It was obvious JJ Abrams had never bothered watching any of the previous movies or there wouldn't have been so many mistakes such as, when the f**k has anyone ever seen a 2 man TIE Fighter. Then you get some random sand junkie who has never piloted before but manages to fly the Millennium Falcon as if she was a Battle of Britain vet. The acting between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher was wooden, especially since they had kids together. As much as I hated the Phantom Menace for all its flaws and Ja Ja Binkses, It towers above this movie as the plot makes absolutely no sense what so ever as a carry on from episode VI. I had been looking forward to this film for a long time, but it looks like Disney is just trying to cash in on a well loved franchise with cheap un-humorous jokes without taking in any of the previous films that it is supposed to supersede.R U kidding me JJ?  SPOILER ALERT This is even too good grade for this movie but its based on that I was sure Kylo will spare his father Han Solo but he killed him, rest of it was a joke Rey finds out in this particular movie she is Force sensitive and after 30 minutes without any training she is ready to confront Kylo Ren and she almost killed him. WTF?! Also light-saber fights are super slow, like we are back in 70' not in 2015. This movie is a joke for everyone who watched all 6 previous episodes For me personally movie is too focused on trooper fights , I would like to see more light - saber fights but that is just my opinion CGI s look great , starship fights absolutely great but that is not their credit that much , it is just technological advancementutter money making bull Without doubt the worst and most disappointing film I have ever seen. There is no way that anyone looked at this films script and thought anything other than the amount of money they would make on a terrible film. How it has such high reviews I have no idea. I'm half expecting some sort of protest or parliamentary legislation to come through giving everyone a full refund out of the dirt bag money grabbing creators own pockets. So much expectation and ignorance from me and any other disappointed fans on release day but to anyone who considers buying the DVD after the general view of the film has come out, it's your own fault. If my own mother was on her last legs and had only 2 hours and 15 minutes left to live and wanted me to sit and watch it with her while she slowly passed, I would let her die on her own rather than watching this film again. Very very annoyed, countless inconsistencies, rushed story and very poor acting. Ruined star warsCasual watchers will love it but die hard fans will be torn. I want to begin this by saying I'm not a massive fan of the franchise. I've watched all of the saga and really enjoyed them as a kid, and I was actually quite looking forward to this installment. The film boasts a plethora of exhilarating action scenes and fantastic visuals but its narrative, writing and character development is where it lacks. The story takes parts of the previous plots and freshens them up with some new faces and some quality CGI but it all seems too familiar and predictable. The characters are just dull. They show no real personality and personally, I just didn't care about them enough to want them to survive the ordeal. It was great to see the old cast make a reappearance but it seemed extremely forced; they proved barely nothing to the actual plot and seemed like they were there just to appease fans of the old series. Also, the new villain is probably one of the most uninspired characters in the saga; a tasteless being with a bipolar accent between American, Scottish and Irish and a reused backstory. The main narrative is a loose repeat of 'A New Hope' but it wasn't executed as well and just dragged on for the 2 hour and 15 minute runtime. The writing wasn't great. I feel like since Disney got their hands on the franchise, they've completely encapsulated it by adding ridiculous amounts of comedy in a way that comes off as slapstick and seems way too modern and contrasts the serious moments terribly. Overall, I think that the new generation are gonna love it because it's harmless fun and it's a predominantly young cast. I also think it's a great platform for the new actors who are all relatively unknown but I think dedicated fans are gonna have a very 'Marmite' opinion of this; they'll either love it or disregard it entirely. Me, personally, think the saga should've ended with Return of the Jedi.A remake of episode IV Story: the script written by Abraams himself along with Lawrence Kasdan (who co-wrote "Empire" and "Jedi") is a solid block of fan service towards Episode IV. It follows identical story patterns - desert planet, kid ready to go off on adventure, mentor comes along the way,etc - but some nice (humorous) twists left and right. Although it delivers with no cringe-worthy scenes, Abraams seems to be focused too much in "New Hope" as he tries avoid the (hilarious) wrath of the internet fan boys. Whereas this is not necessarily a bad decision, it would be been a greater challenge to try to distinguish his film from old ties and allow himself to follow our (old and new) heroes in different settings rather than familiar ones. Of course, this is Star Wars, it had never been about breaking the rules or groundbreaking story material, it is all about family relationships.  Themes: The character interaction is worth the price of the admission alone and it is simply magical to see all those icons that you love talking to each. Main focus here remains the connections between them and the family ties that each one may carry on their shoulders. It had always been a eye catching dynamic that has been explored in the last six films successfully - how Luke reacts to his father's news, how Anakin is going to save Padme, etc - and if it is not broken why fix it? Abraams knows he has a goldmine of characters the audience is willing to see in action surrounded by love, betrayal, friendship, care and heroism and commits rightfully so. Characters: Episode VII boasts a phenomenal cast - from the main protagonist duo to the film's primary villain. It's a pleasure to have Harrison Ford back as Han Solo with the most scene stealing moments and his chemistry with Fisher and Mayhew (Chewbacca) still holds strong since 1983. It is evident that Ford is having a blast at the iconic role and it seems that it has not passed a day since the concluding events of the "Return of the Jedi". Carrie Fisher has little screen time (unexpectedly) but does justice to the material and regarding Mark Hamill's appearance much cannot be said without giving anything away. Among the newcomers, Daisy Ridley makes a strong impact - likable, fierce and vulnerable - she brings a freshness to the Star Wars myths by being almost at the center of the story in a rather dominant boy- ish series. John Boyega is surprisingly charismatic (and amps the humor to 11!) although his character is rather blunt sometimes and feels like filler. Other wellknown cast members are either minimized cameos - Max Von Sydow, Gwendoline Christie come to mind, what a waste!, or glorified ones - looking at you Oscar Isaac. and this is where the film mostly crumbles. An overabundance of characters offer almost nothing at the proceedings instead they are used as an excuse to move the plot forward. It is admirable that Abraams tries to recreate a vivid world of Star Wars but at one point, we are not caring for most of them as they carry almost no significance or dramatic weight. Villain: The best element in the film, main player here is Kylo Ren portrayed by Adam Driver. A rather menacing (and badass) presence, his story arc is by far the most interesting with some nifty emotional touches. Driver plays Ren's obsession/confusion to perfection and surely has the most development in the movie. Not only, he summarizes what is wrong with the dark side, tiny little details regarding his emotional attributes build up his character without requiring much heavy handed exposition or long monologues. At this part, Abraams and Co have succeeded tremendously and Driver's performance carries a dramatic (and tragic) weight reminding the glory of "Revenge of the Sith"'s final act. Direction: Abraams' direction is solid, dynamic and evidently from the Star Trek entries serviceable with similar blended display of CGI and practical effects. However, despite the presence of some inspiring dog fight sequences, Abraams seems to struggle with the lightsaber battle suffering from close ups and intense edit despite the atmospheric setting. It is always good to see no lens flare! - thank you for that - and him trying to keep consistent with the visual flare of the previous films. Following George Lucas's directing (and static) style with a bit of more dramatic movement in the space scenes feels like a natural evolution for a modern entry in the SW canon. Particularly, there is a wonderful shot of Finn fighting his way through a Stormtrooper squad while on the background Dameron is blasting lasers on Tie-fighters. Brilliant. however, it does not bring back any memorable moments due to his insistence to follow the patterns of Episode IV. Although there is a clear enthusiasm, he gets caught in his own excitement to recreate probably his nostalgia. All six films boasted some truly memorable set pieces (Vader vs Luke in Empire, Duel of the fates scene, pd race, Emperor confrontation in Jedi) or visual style (who can forget the almost renaissance like lava landscapes of Mustafar?), yet here, despite the state of the art talent involved, the films feels more a fan service checklist rather than a fully fleshed out adventure. Despite being a technical thrill and a treat for the holiday season, Episode VII though lacks any emotional punch while it is focused on pulling off the nostalgia flag rather than initiate excitement with something new. Abraams has done a serviceable job as the franchise's first helmer with adequate action scenes and a great cast. He falls short though as he sidelines interesting personalities, events and mini plots threads at the expense of the fan service with a blink and you miss ending that sets up further entries.A Brand New Hope After months of eagerly awaiting the star wars franchise to return and with mostly high hopes from the director "J.J.Abrams" I returned home from the midnight release of this classic movie with feelings a movie hasn't made me feel in a very long time. I returned home quickly removing my t shirt to cool down from the sweaty grip of the cinema screen, feeling almost relieved that it was over but desperately wanting more. The curtains widened and the classic rolling yellow letters appeared on screen accompanied by "John Williams" iconic soundtrack and after that everything fell into place. The return of everyone's favorite characters created immense amounts of nostalgia and I couldn't help but have a big cheesy grin on my face every time a familiar face appeared. The new cast were equally as good as the oldies and an exceptional performance from "Oscar Isaac" as to be expected, these new performances really held the movie together. The characters the new cast played were brilliant and fitted in great with the star wars story. The main winning point for this movie is the sheer fact that it most definitely is Star Wars, from start to finish it was good old Star Wars, Bravo.Star Wars: The Force Awakens - a eulogy I just came back from a midnight screening and i have to tell you how it went. There are no spoilers in this piece because it's impossible to spoil this film. There are no words....sorry i have to rephrase...there is no language known to man to describe my shock and utter disgust upon watching this abomination. I'm a middle aged man in my forties and i have watched thousands of movies in my lifetime. This one is by far , by a million miles, the worst movie i had ever the discomfort to endure. It was a disgrace. I believe there is no original idea in the script, not a single one! If you have ever watched "Star Wars: A new hope" don't bother. Its indistinguishable from this one. Its a total rip-off. At one point i wanted to cut my right arm of and f*** myself with my detached limb to distribute the pain evenly. It was unbearable. If it wasn't for the mercy killing towards the end i would have left the theater. My eyes were burning from witnessing the greatest debacle of the film industry since...since...since when actually? Nothing comes to mind! For the first time in my life i heard an audience booing at the end mixed with sighs of relief. About half of the people left early. Oh, how i envy those lucky bastards. Anger and disbelief followed by growing numbness of the face. If you are suicidal watch this film! It gives hope to the the hopeless,cause you truly know what rock bottom is after watching it. There is no point in criticizing specific aspects of the film. Its a total failure across-the-board. Its an all- encompassing disaster of epic proportions. Decades from now people will stand in awe reading pages after pages of inconsistencies meticulously collected by former fans of the franchise. A last service rendered to one of the greatest stories ever told. Star Wars died today. And in the end, it was a relief. Years from now, when you look back on your life you will remember Star Wars as something best described by John and Paul: "And in the end, the love you take Is equal to the love you make."It is not a sequel, but a remake Sad but true. When the opening credits filled the screen (Episode VII... blah blah) I was already grinding my teeth because the plot sounded idiotic. Then the huge star destroyer filled the screen. The fun bit is that the star destroyer had some sort of antenna or whatever at the front and it looked liked the ship was showing the middle finger towards the viewers.  I have to congratulate the film makers as that was pretty much how the film worked from that point forward.  1) A droid has important information that must be delivered to the good guys (Episode IV, anyone?) 2) so the bad guys hunt for the droid on a desert planet (IV)  3) Storm troopers raid a village, killing everyone (IV)  4) A girl is captured by the bad guys and the good guys rush to the base to the rescue. (IV)  5) The girl and the boy have a friend zone relationship through the film (Ep IV, Luke &amp; Leia, wouldn't be surprised to learn that they are siblings in Episode IX)  6) The stormtroopers, elite soldiers of the bad guys, still can't hit a barn door. On the other hand, the good guys always hit, even when they use a weapon for the first time in their life  7) Supreme Leader Snoke = Emperor with a silly name  8) The bad guys have a magnificent new weapon that can destroy planets (Ep IV)  9) They use it to destroy a planet loyal to the rebels (IV)  10) The weapon has shields that can be destroyed by going down on the planet and disabling the shield generator (VI)  11) The epic villain wears a mask that distorts his voice (IV) and sadly, looks better with the mask on than without it. 12) The good guys can only destroy the weapon with an attack by X-Wings on the exact target (IV)  13) The X-Wings have to fly in a tight trench in order to reach their target (IV) The screen writers had absolutely no new ideas to show for their money. A bunch of monkeys could have written better dialogue. A 1st grader could have made a plot that had less holes in it. The special effects were pretty much of the same quality as in the first Star Wars movie that was released 1977. I'd expect something way better in 2015.Star Wars: The Force Gets Boring Have you ever disagreed with someone about the quality of a production so intensely that you've wondered if the two of you even watched the same film? I'm sorry, everyone in the world, I thought The Force Awakens was a real snoozer. I'm not surprised that my eight year old nephew loved it, but I can't for the life of me figure out why the adults I associate with aren't offended at what we've been offered by Abrams as the continuation of the world's foremost loved space epic.  Essentially what it feels like is a reboot of the original series, except this time for kids (no surprise there, Disney), not a meaningful continuation that picks up where the originals left off. Although I did start having my doubts about my future satisfaction with the Star Wars franchise when Disney made its Star Wars paraphernalia so pervasive that one morning I found myself unconsciously buttering my toast with DeathStar Margarine Spread©. Yeah—head trip, but I got over it.  There was virtually zero discussion within the movie itself as to what happened after episode Vl and how we got to where we are now, making this production feel like a desperate lurch to be a stand-alone and to appeal to an audience who is too young to have appreciated the Spice Girls let alone the originals. This direction may be satisfying for some, but for those of us who were expecting more will find ourselves disappointed. Furthermore, I was saddened by the obvious deficiency surrounding the exploration of the mythology of the Force. One of the elements that so intrigued viewers about the originals was the underlying spirituality and the metaphysical forces at play within the Star Wars universe; however, in this version of Star Wars Abrams seems to care more about the characters ceaselessly running away from things and having meaningless, often silly conversation (like in one scene the character Finn asks Rey in the goofiest way possible if she has a boyfriend—I laughed but I was so ashamed) instead of exploring the depths of some of the most intriguing supernatural philosophy in all of moviedom. However, this fact is not surprising as the masses seem to be entertained predominantly by action, comedy, flashing lights, and explosions, not exploring the psychological latitudes of light and dark within the human soul, and definitely not sitting through slow scenes of dialogue which could (God forbid) give us an understanding of the depths of the Star Wars legend and mystery. I suppose in this regard (and in too many others) Abrams gave the people what they wanted. Not only was the confined exploration of the Force disappointing but so was the serious lack of emotional poignancy. At no point, AT LITERALLY NO POINT, did I feel sad, frustrated, anxious, worried, or exhilarated during its belabored two hours and sixteen minutes. The characters felt like they could be potentially cloned from any PG-13 teen movie you've seen since Twilight hijacked the world and forced it's twisted, disgusting version of acceptable adolescent stereotypes upon us. You could almost swap out the light-sabers, tie-fighters, and storm troopers and you'd have a great sequel to whatever the hell number Hunger Games we're on these days (because that's how interesting the rest of the plot was).  Another thing that really annoyed me was the way in which the galaxy was too American. Of course I get it, it was made by Hollywood IT IS American, but guys, this is supposed to be in a GALAXY FAR AWAY, so why was there very little attempt made to try and hide that? Between the all too familiar mannerisms, jokes, and language I just couldn't fully suspend my disbelief. In my opinion, the originals managed to avoid most overt use of cultural indicators, I mean sure, it's impossible to avoid all due to obvious limitations, but watch the main character Finn carefully during the movie and you'll see that he's dripping with 21st century western American dude. Like literally drenched. Where was the otherworldly authenticity among the main characters?  Of course it wasn't all bad. The visuals were beautiful, much of the topography and effects were breathtaking, and I have to admit that I did feel pangs of nostalgia over any scene that included an X-wing, but overall it wasn't enough. Really a lot of what it comes down to is expectation. So many people have told me that they went into it not expecting too much and that they had "fun" watching it; and then there's me sitting here thinking: what on Tatooine are they talking about? With all the media hype this film received, not to mention the disappointment of the prequels, I was expecting a hell of a lot out of this movie, and simple fun ain't gonna cut it. Abrams seemed to have carved the profundity and soul out of Star Wars with a lightsaber— the same soul we've been waiting to enter our lives again ever since the prequels ruined them.  The Force Awakens was half way there, but it felt forced (pun intended), shallow, in need of a more refined plot, more mature characters, a deeper spirituality, moral complexity and depth; it needed to resonate more deeply with the IMPORTANT themes of the original, and to not have felt like a chaste teen romance with some old faces in there used like a box office tractor beam. If you're content with having your childhood favorite epic turned into a lovable, easily digestible icon of twenty-first century pop culture, marketed intentionally at young people to delight and entertain whilst simultaneously causing you to cringe at the fact that the original actors are okay with such a disservice to a beloved story, then you will enjoy the continuation of this franchise.  May the force save us from this trilogy.Boring and Predictable I jut got just back from the cinema, watching a movie everyone has been waiting for since 1983, me included. And i got to say, I'm starting to get a little bit tired of watching a 2 hour movie about destroying a death star. Because here we go again! George Lucas did not succeed with his follow-up movies, and there is many reasons for that. And no, it is mainly not because of Jar-Jar, it is because he just threw in one epic battle after the other, without having any good story, or any good plot, and at times horrible acting to come with it. Michael Bay has this as his trademark, but he is still very successful and his movies makes billions. And why is that?. Because kids. And the Star wars and transformers franchises have in common that they sell toys, in large quantity. This is what really makes the big bucks over time. Not the movies themselves. The movies are just big commercials for toys. George Lucas knew this better than anyone. And he is a brilliant businessman, but not so brilliant when it comes to making movies. I do like the first Star wars trilogy, with "the empire strikes back" as my favorite, this is by the way the film in the trilogy George Lucas himself dislikes the most. That pretty much explains why the second trilogy was so bad, as "The Empire Strikes back" spends more time developing a story than the other two films in the original trilogy, and therefor you get more attached to the characters. When George Lucas then made His second trilogy, all character development went out the window. This was a trilogy that was going to sell more toys, and that's it. Lucas has even half-way admitted this later on. And the fans of the Star wars franchise have disliked the second trilogy almost since release. I say almost, because many did hang in there for years, denying that the second trilogy was bad. But now most people seem to have noticed. So here we are in 2015 and J.J. Abrams takes over. He is the new skip, he gave us a fantastic reboot with Star Trek, now he is going to save us all from the god awful mistakes of George Lucas. We all believed it, we all hoped for it, at least he can not do worse than Lucas. The biggest hype of all time was born. And we fight a death star.... again.... Just a lot bigger.... Because of course bigger, at least they couldn't make it smaller..... What about not including a death star... Yet again? This movie tries so hard to show us a lot of cool stuff. But the pacing is awful, the slapstick humor is mostly misplaced, the introduction of the leading actors suffers from very bad timing. This movie basically tries to look and feel exactly like the original Star Wars film, but fails to bring us close to the leading characters. In the story, 30 years has gone by. A lot of things happen in that time, but the movie can't tell us anything about what has happened in those 30 years, all we get is guns blazing from the get go, till the very end. Almost no character development what so ever. Not even for Rey, the leading actress. Did J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan think it was enough to show us that when Rey eats less food than usual, was enough to make us really care for her? And just add in the "The family will never come back for you" sub plot? which BTW has no impact. Yes OK Rey is struggling a bit when we meet her, but she looks very healthy, she is climbing ropes and running like an Olympian in sand.. Ahh no, now i know. They showed us she had good morale by not selling the droid to get a lot more food.. Ahh.. So complicated. *sigh* This movie is so disappointing. This was their chance to make it right. To make Star Wars good again, not only focus on what 12 year old kids want to see constantly for 2 hours, which is laser beams and explosions. But it makes perfect sense, because these films are now all about making the big bucks, which is from selling toys. And now this film was released just before Christmas... No coincidence. So it's time to just take in some facts, the movies we grew up with, are never coming back. The only ones in the business that seem to get the movie story and toys business combo right, is Marvel. They had all this time. All this money. All this willpower. And this is what they come up with. Terrible script, bad story, outdated soundtrack, taking few or no risks to renew the franchise by telling the exact same story as before. What is really good about this film is the CGI and Sound effects. But that should not come as a surprise to anyone. The acting is mediocre. No one stands out and brings a really good performance. 4/10 - Very disappointing.It's like when an unknown Chinese manufacturer decided to make a fake iPhone So today I went to the premiere of the long awaited new star wars Episode 7.  Here is a fast and short opinion: The movie blows really blows.  Here is the more detailed opinion. The movie has no star wars feeling. None. No deep dialogs about the force and almost no background about what happened in the period between episode 6 and this one.  The dialogs between Ray and Finn sound like two modern age teenagers talking (first real dialogue between them, Finn asks Ray if she has a boyfriend). Horrible. Then there is the First Order (successors of The Empire) the bad guys. Their leader commander is the Sith wimp Kylo Ren who answers to a extremely bad CGI drawn Supreme leader (really?) about whom the audience doesn't get any information at all.  Kylo Ren is an insecure teenager with anger issues. His character destroys the sleek mysterious Sith presentation of the both prequel as the original trilogy. This is really a bad thing.  The main weapon of the First order is a death star on steroids. But the way the weapon works is taken straight out of Star Trek. This is a criminal offense.  Han Solo and Chewbacca appeared in the movie absolutely out of nowhere. It's like Abrams and Disney were desperate to throw them in there just for nostalgia.  Once again out of nowhere Ray figures out she has Jedi powers. The first time it happens is when Luke Skywalker's (who as been explained shortly decided abandon everyone and live in isolation in a place unknown) light-saber suddenly possesses the ability to show her where it's located in exactly the same way like bracelet of Anubis showed to Evelyn it's location in the movie Mummy returns. Also the audience figures out later on that non-Jedi's also can fight with light-sabers when Finn ( not a Jedi ) fight the wimpy Sith Kylo Ren. It's like who needs Jedi's, give a light-saber to a regular Joe and he will fight almost as good as a Jedi who had years of training.  There is one scene near the ending that is so incredibly bad it just makes you want to get up and leave the theater. It's a scene between Han Solo and Kylo Ren. Every person who has more than 2 brain cells will know what is going to happen. This scene is a direct spit in the face to the bad-ass Han Solo we all know and love. Conclusion:  Because Disney and Abrams decided not to include George Lucas in any way this movie has no Star wars feel and no soul. It's like when an unknown Chinese manufacturer decided to make a fake iPhone. They can call it an iPhone as much as they want, but it isn't an iPhone.The Manipulation Power of Nostalgia and Mass Appeal I want to start by stating I truly have enjoyed all Star Wars movies prior to this one. Even the prequels (which are obviously not as good) demolish this movie in plot, character building and EVEN action sequences. (there is only two lightsaber battles and they last seconds) Anyone with a brain and knowledge of the original trilogy can see that Star Wars: Episode VII was a regurgitation of the first three film's plot condensed into two hours. Everything was the same with slight twists down to the famous "Luke, I am your father" scene except it's with Han Solo and his apparent Sith son who stabs and throws off of the new Death Star. They added a bigger and badder Death Star, tossed Anakin's lightsaber around to whoever felt like using it to fight and did a terrible job of carrying on Star Wars essence. It was flooded with humor and half a**ed acting. There was no training or build up of power Rey is literally able to defeat the most powerful Sith Lord as a teenage girl who days before didn't even know she was a Jedi. Finn was able to wield and use a lightsaber although as far as I am concerned he is not a Jedi.  Han Solo and Chewbacca just happen to come across the Millennium Falcon after 30 years which just happens to have Luke Skywalker's daughter, Finn, and a droid carrying the map to Luke Skywalker on it. The film was pretty much downhill for me from this point on I spent most of my time watching this with a "What???" face and hands up in confusion as to how they could have made the film suck so bad. This film literally spanned out the introduction of old characters we know and love in order to keep our attention and keep us excited to see the next only to disappoint us with no further elaboration in story and literally no emotion. Leia hardly even reacted to losing the love of her life Han Solo. The dialogue between the two of them was rushed and obvious that they were trying to explain 30 years of story in small talk.  What I take as the mentality for this film: MAKE A BIGGER DEATHSTAR, OH BIGGER EMPEROR TOO (srsly what was up with that), GIRL JEDI MAIN CHARACTER, BLACK GUY WHO MIGHT BE A JEDI TOO MAIN CHARACTER (I am African American so don't take this as racism) people are going TO EAT THIS UP. And congratulations, you all did and now they will keep milking the franchise and making terribly thought out films with nothing more than CGI and humor to make up for it.  Throughout this film I found myself wanting to walk out of the theater and just be done but I couldn't resist waiting for the punchline of this joke of a film and boy did I get it. After all of the humor riddled torture we are brought to the final scene. Rey is going to see her long lost dad who I guess spent all of this time standing on a random mountain looking at the beach. And then it happens, what we had all been waiting for. Luke turns around and sees the daughter he was forced to abandon and she hold out Anakin's lightsaber as some odd tribute to him (I don't see the symbolism in this) at this point I just burst out laughing at how bad this journey has been and that's it it's over. The next thing I see is JJ Abrams. I proceeded to scream "BOO" at the screen multiple times with the only response to it being "cmon it wasn't that bad" after that I walked outside and contemplated throwing up as the movie was so bad it caused me to feel nauseous.  This film took advantage of Star Wars fans and played into a hand of re-doing famous scenes with different characters and telling the same story over again. It's sad that people actually think this movie was good or acceptable because now they are going to once again shame the Star Wars name. BOYCOTT EPISODE 8. THIS RENDITION NEEDS TO BE SCRAPPED AND REBOOTED THEY ARE JUST MILKING THIS FRANCHISE.Was this supposed to be a SEQUEL....or REBOOT? Failed miserably at both.... A small droid carrying classified data crash lands on desert planet. Meets teenage characters. Rebel Alliance needs the data to fight the Empire's new planet-destroying weapon. Rinse and repeat. Sound familiar? That was the plot to both Episode IV: A New Hope, and Jar-Jar Abrams latest calamity that just found its way onto cinema screens across the country. I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to like this movie-- but alas, we got yet another one of Abrams' typical mind-numbing explosion-fests. It has ALL of Jar-Jar Abrams normal movie failings: * A cast of characters almost entirely made up of pre-adolescents trying to play adult roles. * Dialogue/screenplay that seems like it was written by an 8-year old. * Nothing that even slightly resembles a plot. I am surprised Abrams didn't put "Red Matter" in this movie to fill in all the gaps between his weak story-telling and the plot loopholes it creates, like he did with Star Disaster XI. As is the case with most of the reboots he has done to date-- Abrams lacks the creativity and writing ability to come up with an original and compelling plot on his own, so he just plagiarizes an existing story and makes "some changes" to better fit his "vision" (as in LSD-induced) of it. He props up these mindless stories by inserting a bunch of unnecessary homage moments to famous lines and clichés from the previous established films in the mythos to try and give his creation validity ("He's dead, Jim"). Really? Another movie about destroying a death star? A droid carrying the plans that the Empire wants to stop from falling into Alliance hands? How original.... He doesn't care if his stories makes sense or not, or if he breaks his own rules; in Star Trek XI, like when the Enterprise could not beam up Spock's mother (because she was falling), but later in the movie, Scotty and Kirk beamed onto the Enterprise from another solar system while it was moving at warp speed with no problems! The Force Awakens had PLENTY of these "Abrams' moments". A wise man once told me-- "The litmus test for good and bad storytelling comes down to this: do the actions of the characters in your story fit the background and motivations you gave them in your story history? If not-- it is GARBAGE." For instance, a Romulan captain, so enraged his home planet got destroyed-- would not sit on his hands for 25 years, waiting for Spock (who, given the complexity of time travel-- might NEVER have appeared) to show up, so he can blow up the entire galaxy (obviously Abrams does not understand interstellar distances) just to show everyone just how mad he really is!! Now there is a story that will be remembered over the ages.... The actors in this movie were so poor-- it was difficult to tell what exactly their motivations, passions, and driving ideals were. They all had about as much emotional content as Hayden Christiansen (little or none) from the prequels. * Explosions and guns ablazing, pretty much from the moment the beginning credits close until the end credits start rolling. By the time you are 5 minutes into the movie-- you are already bored and desensitized to it. I am not surprised to find that many of the people who thought Star Trek XI and XII (the one with a Caucasian Khanoonian Singh) were good movies, also think this movie was in any way memorable (other than the humongous sense of disappointment I walked out of the theater feeling). Jar-Jar Abrams should be banned from ruining any more legendary movie franchises. The fans themselves could have written a better story and backdrop for this film.Blockbuster: Unimaginative, cheap, no fantasy, lacked vision I loved all the previous star wars movies (yes, even the prequels).  But this, this was just deeply disappointing. I could get past all the cheap/easy typical Disney humour (which is actually enjoyable in cartoons) but the plot of the movie, lack of character development, and lack of star wars was just too much. The only thing making this movie resemble star wars were the old stars from the original movie. it was pleasant to see Han Solo, but only as a fan of the original film. Within itself, the whole Leia-Han Solo love story was completely destroyed by this movie. Their relationship seemed superficial. but it didn't really matter because there was just no time for character development or illustration of the depth of their relationship. The movie just needed to show more dull fight scenes, entirely recycled across the original trilogy.  The meaning and depth of the force was cheapened: apparently now a storm trooper can not just use a light saber but also fight and win with a Sith Lord (who at the beginning of the film was able to stop bullets mid air, kill with the force, and read people's minds).  The force doesn't awaken because we never see the force being forgotten. Instead the new characters at one recognize Han Solo and know everything there is to know about Skywalker: boring much?! Reminds me of a bad episode IV.  The plot of the film is essentially going to destroy the death star.... yes the death star... BUT NO WAIT IT'S 10X BIGGER IT'S FINE.  All in all, even writing the review is painful. I was expecting a beautifully executed movie, given the advancement of technology and funding for this. Instead I saw something so simple, I wanted to leave (during the premiere). Clearly, long gone are the days of incredible creatures, amazing costumes (shout out to Lucas). And in are the days of a cheap villain, who looks like he came straight out of a Disney princess movie: and acts the same....  Please, please, please improve the next movie. DO A PLOT. We can think for ourselves, I promise....Disappointment all around I was really looking forward to this movie even knowing that Abrams will be directing it. And now I wish I didn't watch. It was just bad. No other words for it. Everyone already said about plot being just a random rehash of previous episodes. We've already seen all situations, all locations, all plot turns. There's nothing original in this movie and it seems pointless in general.  SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Some basics of the SW Universe are changed to accommodate the characters. Now a guy who is not a Force-user can fight with a trained Sith using a lightsaber. Untrained Force-user can use jedi mindtricks with no training at all. Sith can feel a non-Force-user from across considerable distance but not if the same man is standing 10 meters apart from him. Stormtroopers see Sith have a fit if pointless hysterics and calmly walk away from him despite his summons. Light Side is a constant seduction to Siths. And so on and so on... It all feels like a badly written fanfic. END SPOILERS And it is also filmed badly. In all Star Wars movies first appearance of ship or a planet always was a momentous scene. This is totally lost here. Also there are many unflattering camera angles, poorly choreographed scenes, battle sequences are rushed and not always thought-out. With modern technology and special effects it could have been magnificent, but instead it's cheaply looking. I've caught myself thinking that "A New Hope" looked better and more advanced than this one. Maybe if you've never watched Star Wars you will like this movie, but for those familiar with old episodes it most probably will be a major let down. 1 out of 10 just because it' impossible to give 0.Not the Movie I Paid to See CRITIQUE  1. If you want to know what this movie is about, then simply watch Star Wars Episode IV (A New Hope), because the story is nearly verbatim with elements thrown in from episodes V and VI for good measure. 2. The leads who take the rein from the old Star Wars Universe are: Hispanic, black, and a woman. There is nothing wrong with this in and of itself, but when it is done simply to be politically correct, then the story suffers. I think one critic describes this best when she said, "For the first time in Star Wars history, a franchise will be built around the adventures of the sort of people that Hollywood routinely overlooks: women and people of color. So even if The Force Awakens sucks, it's made one big diverse achievement for Hollywood." This means the only place you will see an honest review of this movie is in the user reviews here at IMDb 3. Luke is now Obi Wan, his long lost daughter is the new hope, and his nephew is the new Darth Vader 4. They broke nearly every rule established by the original Star Wars. Jedi talent no longer takes years of training, nor does one need to be strong with the force to hold his own in a light saber battle against a trained Sith lord, etc. WHAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE There are 100 places they could have taken this story. They could have made Jar Jar a secret Sith lord who was playing dumb all these years, they could have worked in elements of Star Wars Rebels and made Ezra a Sith lord, or they could have had it where Luke turned to the dark side. I even heard early rumors that they were going to have Finn find Luke's severed hand with a light saber in it. To me, it would have made the most sense to do a story where the Republic is now the political force of the Galaxy and the First Order are the rebels. Luke could have been training a new Jedi order and they could have shown a growing Sith threat, with a real villain and not the weanie in panties that we got in this movie, throughout the battles with the First Order. They could have made Hans more distinguished (after all he was a King and it's been 30 years, so he should have grown up by now). Instead, we got the same Han Solo from 1975 but who looked 40 years older and disheveled. I'm sure Harrison Ford had no intention of doing another Star Wars movie and insisted that this would be the last one. So he would have been killed off no matter what. However, it could have been far less predictable and more creative and touching. If they wanted to keep the story line they went with, then they still could have started this way and shown how Kylo Rey was turning to the dark side. Any of these would have been far better than the trash I saw tonight. It's amazing how I could think of these story lines (as I'm sure can 1000s of other Star Wars fans) but none of the so called talented writers, producers, and directors in Hollywood can do this? This simply amounts to lazy writing and oversight. CONCLUSION Because everything was so predictable and the story was a rehash of what we already saw, the movie was BORING! It's amazing how Hollywood can continue to put out movies like this, cheat their viewers, and then wonder in astonishment why everyone stays home to stream or pirate movies. Maybe it's because more and more movies these days simply support overpaid political activists whose only creative effort is to make a political statement at the expense of entertainment. I'm done with Star Wars. I don't need to see episodes VIII or IX, because I already know what is going to happen. Episode VIII and IX will be remakes of the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi with Ren as Luke, Luke as Obi Wan, and Kylo Rey as Darth Vader. I'm sure VIII will have the surprise statement by Kylo Rey when he battles Ren saying, "Ren, I am your cousin," and IX will end with Ren bringing Rey to the good side with little furry creatures celebrating in tree tops and the ghosts of Luke and Han looking approvingly over the scene. Yeah, been there done that, there is no sense in my wasting money or time to do it again. Star Wars is Dead! Thanks Disney and Abrams and you politically correct whackos. Thanks a lot! A NOTE ON POSITIVE REVIEWS After reading many of the positive reviews, I can only come to the conclusion that 1/3 of them are written by hard core Star Wars fans who will rave about anything with the "Star Wars" logo attached to it and will refuse to their dying day that they were wrong about this movie, 1/3 by people who never saw Star Wars and accept this cheap rip off because it is the only version of the story they have seen, and 1/3 by studio hacks. The positive reviewers have also resorted to calling the negative reviewers "Haters." It's amazing how convenient it is today for people to throw that word around to discredit anyone who has a differing opinion. That should tell you everything you need to know about the character and honesty of the positives reviewers.The new "New hope" dies at the hands of the Disney money-making machine There may be some spoilers, even though I have done my best to avoid them!  I am a big fan of the OT, and like many fans was disappointed by the silly prequels. I felt excited for this new trilogy, and hoped JJ Abrams was going to be able to give us new stories to propel the series forward. After the prequels, at least there was the hope of someone new coming in and renewing the sense of magic and wonder that have been the very soul of the OT. Now this hope has been extinguished. Disney has put so much effort into safely making money (a lot of it, too), from the cash cow that is Star Wars, that they have stifled any creativity that could have made this movie great.  For more detail read below : I saw the movie last night, and here are its best and worst moments. What worked:  1. Imagery - hands down, awesome visuals, but that is to be expected given how much this movie must have cost to make.  2. The new droid, BB8 is cute  3. There was no Jar Jar Binks :)  4. Some humor, still falling a bit flat of the original  5. The reunion of Han Solo and Chewbacca, those two were as great as ever What did not work (for me) 1. The weak story - practically a rehash or the "A New Hope" plot, but without the freshness and creativity that made the original work so well. Throughout the whole movie I had the feeling of "been there, done that", and ended up being bored. I mean, we are destroying the Death Star for a third time now, really? Ooooh, but this time it is bigger. And we are again hiding a secret information in a droid?. Snooze.  2.The main characters. What worked so well in the OT was they had introduced very charismatic characters and they also took the time to develop them and give us reasons to care for them. The creation of bonds of friendship and camaraderie between Han, Luke and Leia happened organically, made sense and was justified. The three new leads try to display the same, but it feels forced as nothing in the story should have lead them to feel that way about each other. I could not bring myself to are about Poe, or Rey or Finn, so not sure how they will carry the franchise forward  3. Weak villains who do not project enough danger for the Resistance. I admit, it must be hard to equal, let alone top, such awesome villains as Lord Vader or the Emperor. Still, the new villains, Supreme Commander Snoke, Kylo Ren and Hux come across as average wanna-bees and do not provide the necessary feel of dread, to make us feel threatened.  4. Weak script. I had high hopes after I learned Lawrence Kasdan was writing the script, but my hopes were unfounded. In the OT each main character was given a very compelling reason why they were involved with the rebels. For Leia, it was because of her father, Luke saw his family killed, and Han, after his initial resistance, had fallen for Leia and had come back to rescue Luke during the raid against the Death Star. In this new movie, there was no compelling reason for Finn, and ex-storm trooper, to somehow overcome being brainwashed and conditioned to kill and develop high moral principles and sense of humor. For Rey, there was no compelling reason to rescue BB8 in the desert. Poe was already with the resistance, but feeling all buddy-buddy with Finn happened all of a sudden, more because of "well the main characters are supposed to be like that" rather than any sense-making reason  5. No character development. I cannot believe that they had such golden opportunity to introduce the new leads who should have been these new interesting characters, and they did nothing to develop them and make us feel any sense of camaraderie with them! I mean, Finn, trying to overcome his storm trooper conditioning; Rey going from a desert scavenger to something more; Kylo Ren's insecurities, his volatility and his rivalry with Hux - all of these could have been used to give us some memorable moments, and instead were wasted.  6. Things happening too quickly and in a forced way. Remember how Luke had to train to access the Force and gain any control over it? Remember Ben Kenoby, a seasoned Jedi, using Jedi mind tricks? Well the new Jedi uses these things without any training at all, it all just happens out of nowhere  7. Musical score. The Star Wars theme is easily one of the most epic, amazing movie scores ever written. If I had not wanted to be a Jedi so bad, just the Imperial march alone would have made me join the Dark Side :))) So I was hoping we were going to get some more musical awesomeness, after all, it did happen for the sucky prequels, right? Not so here. To my disappointment, there was no awesome First Order theme, no nothing. It pains me so much to say that, because in my mind John Williams is and will remain the greatest movie composer everA slightly more adult Star Wars that shows Lucas was right to let go of the series. I have never been a huge fan of the Star Wars films--especially after the last three films they made. Too often, in my opinion, the emphasis was merchandising cute characters to kids instead of making the best possible sci-fi film. Fortunately, now that George Lucas sold off the franchise, Disney actually has made a slightly darker and slightly more adult addition to the franchise...and I was thoroughly impressed. I really DON'T want to talk about the plot of "The Force Awakens"-- mostly because the movie just debuted and I would prefer folks experience it themselves. However, I don't think it spoils it in any way to say that the film is a bit of the old and a bit of the new. So, folks who loved the earlier films (particularly the great ones) will be happy that the film is clearly Star Wars and has a lot of similar plot elements from the earlier movies. You also get to see some familiar faces. But there also are several new ones and they seem to have a bit more depth than usual. I particularly liked Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley)--they were not just formulaic characters and you really like and respect them. The bottom line is that the film very much kept my interest and Disney seemed much more focused on story and, especially, characterization. A thoroughly enjoyable film from start to finish.Brilliant Special Effects and Nice Mix of the Old and New Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)  *** (out of 4)  I'm pretty sure every person on Earth know what the film is about and just in case you don't I'm not going to spoil anything here in regards to the plot. Yes, it's basically a reworking of A NEW HOPE with the old and new characters being brought together to go up against the Dark Side. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS was probably the most anticipated movie in recent memory and as no shocked it turned out to be a massive hit. I predicted when I heard that it was going to be made that it would eventually become the top grossing movie ever made. It hasn't quite reached that mark as of me writing this but I'm sure it will happen. So, we know it was a massive hit but how was the actual movie?  I'm not a major STAR WARS fan but this one here isn't nearly as good as episodes four through six. How could it be? With that said I must admit that I found the film to be extremely entertaining, which is all I was personally asking for. I thought J.J. Abrams did a very good job at building up the new characters and the new story while also keeping the original trilogy fans happy. I thought the screenplay was clever in how the old characters were brought into this new story and I won't complain about any of the events that happen in regards to the story. The special effects, as you'd expect, are spectacular and they certainly push the level in regards to what can be done today. The various space battles were tremendous to look at and best of all is that they feel 100% authentic and real. There wasn't a single battle where you didn't feel as if you were right there in the action and this is always a major plus. Another thing are that the robotic characters are all well-designed and manage to fit right in with the series. The film is full of wonderful action scenes and all of them are full of terrific atmosphere. Performance wise, against I'm not going to spoil anything major so all I will say is that the original three actors are all excellent in how they are used. The new people like Daisy Ridley, JOhn Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver all are good and I think fans have a nice cast to take this series into the future. Of course, we also have Chewbacca back, which is always fun. The film does have some flaws and I think some of it is based around the humor. The film goes for a lot of humor and I thought a lot of it didn't work all that well. Ford and Chewbacca get some nice moments together but many times the jokes fell flat. I'd also say that the film ran on a tad bit too long but the ending was so wonderful that it was fun once it came. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is really just a set-up for what's to follow and it certainly has me excited for what comes next.The force has awakened! Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'. Despite seeing 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' around the time it first came out (maybe a little after), there was a long time of being put off by the vitriolic hate it's gotten here and the practical war zone there is in order to review it (even when it was critically acclaimed). Finally mustering the courage, count me in as somebody who loved 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens'. A masterpiece? No. Better than the prequels? Absolutely, and although some may disagree this is saying a lot. The best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi?' Yes. 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is not the most original plot-wise. It has been criticised for being a re-hash of 'A New Hope', understandably. However, instead of being done in a cheap and slap-in-the-face way, it felt like an affectionate and nostalgic homage. Exemplified by bringing back major characters from the original trilogy in supporting roles. JJ Abrams, and this may be considered blasphemy, does a much better job here than he did with his 'Star Trek' reboot films, here he keeps the original spirit of the original trilogy intact while giving the film its own identity at the same time. While it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic at the expense of creating memorable characters, a fun story and brains and heart. The characters are memorable with easily identifiable leads, the original trilogy characters bringing a lot of affectionate nostalgia and a well executed if not iconic (not by Darth Vader standards anyhow) villain in Kylo Ren (unpredictable and dangerous but feeling he is morally justified). The story lacks originality but more than makes up for it in energy, non-stop heart-thumping thrills and excitement, generosity, a cheerfulness that is positively space operatic, vibrant charm and a few fresh twists along the way. In many ways it is a celebration of the universe while also an expansion of it. It is sometimes sentimental but never overly so, one crucial death scene is just heart-wrenching (particularly Chewbacca's reaction) and doesn't feel like a slap in the face to the character in question. Could the villains have been better written? Ren is fine but Snoke only just about works as a character thanks to the visual effects and especially the powerfully enigmatic with a touch of vulnerability performance of Andy Serkis, other than that the character is underwritten. Also felt that Gwendoline Christie's character was unnecessary, so limited was her screen time. Visually, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed with Abrams' visual storytelling shining far more here than it has in other films he's done. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films. Thank goodness that the dialogue contains little to none of the cheesiness heard in the prequels, and it even has more layers than that of the original trilogy. Acting also shines, with winning charismatic performances from John Boyega and particularly Daisy Ridley. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher still have it, while Max Von Sydow shows himself to be a master of gestures and eye contact speaking louder than words. Adam Driver is a suitably menacing Ren and Serkis makes much of his somewhat underwritten character. Oscar Isaac gives a typically strong performance. In conclusion, a great film, the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and one of the best of the saga too. 9/10 Bethany CoxWhere to begin?! Unlike many moviegoers, I couldn't care less about the STAR WARS franchise these days. Sure, I grew up with the original trilogy, which I still know and love, but George Lucas single-handedly destroyed the goodwill surrounding those movies with his mishandling of the prequels. The good news is that THE FORCE AWAKENS - a genuine sequel to RETURN OF THE JEDI - is better than the prequels, but only just. Because this is a deeply flawed movie that gets ten things wrong for everything it gets right. While it's a delight to see Harrison Ford effortlessly breezing back into one of his most iconic roles, the rest of the production is a mixed bag of good and bad, of the woeful and the wonderful. Inevitably, the special effects are one of the strongest things here. The copious use of the CGI looks better than ever, and the alien planets involved in the story are all well realised. You can't fault the large-scale action sequences, which look great in high definition, and as a whole the film is a visual treat. A shame, then, that the story is so weak and a virtual retread of the first STAR WARS film, A NEW HOPE, made all those years ago. The new villains are laughable and Adam Driver's attempts at an iconic baddie along the lines of Darth Vader are quite pitiful. The starkiller stuff is as predictable as it gets, and you wonder why they couldn't go in a fresh and new direction instead of simply regurgitating what has come previously. The new characters don't fare very well either. John Boyega, who was so good in ATTACK THE BLOCK, struggles with a put-on American accent that rings hollow. Daisy Ridley is even worse: this newcomer seems to have overdosed on Keira Knightley performances, copying Knightley's style of acting throughout and feeling completely artificial as a result. All of her lines sound cheesy and wooden, and frankly I felt embarrassed watching her attempting to act alongside the more seasoned actors. It says something that the droid, BB-8, was my favourite of the new characters, given that his high 'cuteness' factor is a shamelessly manipulative attempt to endear him to audiences. Add in a non-ending of a film that merely opens the door for the next inevitable instalment, and you have an oddly hollow film that looks nice but falls apart as soon as you start picking at it.The Return of Star Wars It's over 30 years since the defeat of the empire. The Republic is threatened by the First Order led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) under the control of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). The resistance led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is fighting the Dark Side. Finn (John Boyega) is a conflicted stormtrooper. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger on the planet Jakku. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is the Resistance ace pilot. It has been over 30 years since the last truly good Star Wars movie. It is a great reboot and a solid repair job to the damage from the prequels. The biggest complaint seems to be that this is a repeat of A New Hope. If anything, this is pulling out scenes and references from all three originals. I have no problems with that. In fact, it's good to go back and take pages out of the original trilogy. Even the force is explained more in the traditional way. However, this is not a simple repeat. The new characters are tremendous. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are amazing additions. He's an interesting character and I love their initial meeting. I love him keep grabbing her hand. There are some minor problems but they're too minor to mention especially considering the spoilers. I rank 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980) the best, 'A New Hope' (1977) second, and I may squeeze 'The Force Awakens' slightly ahead of 'Return of the Jedi' (1983). Forget the prequels. P.S. In this one, nobody loses a lightsaber fight because of elevation.Overcomes its inherent challenges by producing a fast paced, dramatic, fun, and very enjoyable film that hits all its marks By all accounts, this film really shouldn't work as well as it does. Looking at it in the cold light of day it is essentially a repeat of the original film in terms of narrative – albeit with some details changed and all the characters moved sideways by a generation. So we have the same parent/child divide, the same innocent discovering their power, right down to the same finale with a large planet-sized weapon. Associated with this it also rides very heavily on nostalgia and brand recognition so that we probably accept a lot of plotting conveniences that we would scoff at in a film we came into cold. However, even seeing all these things, it is hard not to love it for how well it works. It does this by getting the balanced right between all the many aspects that the film seeks to pull together. So we have the nostalgia and a very familiar narrative, but at the same time we have a story that is delivered in a way that engages and is surprisingly moving at times (albeit due to that self-same nostalgia and reliance on us already being invested in this universe and the characters). It also manages to be fun but yet also able to transition into darker moments without one damaging our enjoyment of the other. This is what makes it work I think – because it is really an enjoyable film to watch. It never really stops moving, and the characters are rather thin, but within this frame they work and are engaging. The cast are a big part of that, and it is a very well-cast piece given that the new faces are not dominated by the old familiar ones. Boyega makes good on that charisma he showed when playing the lead in Attach the Block, while Ridley is really natural and likable. For all the fuss over a black storm trooper and a female 'Luke', the truth is that both do a great job regardless of race/color – but do bring that extra factor into play (I had a daughter recently, and it did rather focus my mind on the deficient of strong female characters who are played for themselves, not for their sexuality). The cast is deep in familiar faces and really everyone is on good form – Fisher perhaps seems there because she has to be, but it was nice to see Ford manage to have a bit of a twinkle back in his eyes. The volume of familiar faces in tiny roles does get a bit distracting (particularly if you have watched any shows from Abrams and know his usual cast) but this is a minor thing since the film otherwise does a very good job of keeping you with it for all its adventure and fun. Such a hyped film with such weight on its shoulders really shouldn't be able to be so light on its feet while also delivering dramatic and emotional moments, but it does. A really enjoyable Star Wars film that delivers a lot – and regardless what George Lucas thinks, it has been a very long time since that was the case.On par with the old films Now the title of this review is probably the ultimate compliment when it comes to huge Star wars fans out there. Unfortunately I am not one of them. I liked the old films and I liked this new movie here just as much, without considering either to be groundbreaking or some other superlative. This new movie runs for 2 hours and 15 minutes and was written and directed by J.J. Abrams, who is mostly known for "Lost" and "Star Trek". It is the ultimate breakthrough movie for John Boyega, but even more so Daisy Ridley. And while I liked the latter, I thought that it was so nice to see Oscar Isaac as usual. Cool reunion also from "Inside Llewyn Davis" with Adam Driver here, even if the two had no scenes together. Fans of the old "Star Wars" film will appreciate the inclusion of Harrison Ford, who has lots of screen time, Carrie Fisher, who has solid screen time, and Mark Hamill, who has almost no screen time, but it is indicated that he will make a much bigger impact in the next film. This new "Star Wars" film managed no less than five Academy Award nominations, all in the technical categories and this also describes the film perfectly. Yes there are some interesting plot developments and characters, but it's really all about the technical side. Music, effects, editing etc. are all really good. The acting is mostly fine, but nothing to rave about. This does also include Harrison Ford, who has a truly baity supporting role here and I am a bit shocked he got no awards attention for his turn here. He and Driver also share the most dramatic and emotionally crucial scene of the film during their interaction on a bridge. Oh yeah and let us not forget about the light saber action scenes. These are truly cool to watch, no denying. There are a couple more famous names included here and the one I want to mention as well is Domhnall Gleeson, who is having an amazing year with all the films he is in. Finally, I also liked the little robot and Chewbacca of course, who bring some solid comic relief, certainly more than most of the "human" characters' one-liners that weren't as funny as they were intended to be. All in all, this film was pretty much what I expected. Great action and impressive visually (check it out on the big screen), but not really convincing in terms of story and character development. The financial success does not come surprising at all though. The brand is obviously as much in demand as always. I believe it was a good watch and if you like science fiction more than I do, you will probably have an even better watch and appreciate this film even more than I did. This does not say, of course, that I did not like it. On the contrary, I had a pretty good times and it's certainly an achievement for a film with that runtime that I almost never felt it dragged. Thumbs up and nice cliffhanger ending too. I will certainly watch the next one as well.Give the Sensation of Déjà Vu Thirty years after the fall of the Galactic Empire, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is vanished and there is a new threat to the Republic: The First Order under the command of the Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). General Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the Resistance has sent her best pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) to the planet Jakku to get a map with the location of her brother. However, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the Stormtroopers destroy the village and Poe hides the map in his droid BB- 8 before he is captured. Ren wants to kill the last Jedi and needs to know his whereabouts. But the Stormtrooper FN-2187 (John Boyega) saves Poe and flees with him in a TIE fighter. Poe calls him Finn, but they crash on Jakku and Finn survives while Poe disappears. Meanwhile the scavenger teenager Rey (Daisy Ridley) finds BB-8 and brings him to the trade camp. But Ren discovered that BB-8 has the map and attacks Jakku. However Rey, Finn and BB-8 steal the Millennium Falcon that is left in a junkyard and escape from Jakku. When the spacecraft breaks down in space, they meet Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca. They have an incident with gangs but they succeed to go to the Resistance base, but Rey is captured by Ren. But the Resistance learns that the huge Starkiller Base is powering a weapon to destroy their planet and now their only chance to destroy the weapon depends on Han Solo, Chewbacca and Finn that wants to save Rey.  All the fans had great expectations with "Star Wars: The Force Awakens", but the film has an unoriginal story. The franchise is orphan of George Lucas and the new writers were not able to create anything new. The Death Star is replaced by the Starkiller Base. Darth Vader, the father of Luke Skywalker, is replaced by Kylo Ren, the son of Han Solo and Leia. R2-D2 is replaced by BB-8. Senator Palpatine, or Darth Sidious, is replaced by the Supreme Leader Snoke. The destruction of the weapon depends of the explosion of the power generator. There are so many similarities in the story of "The Force Awakens" with the other episodes that gives the sensation of déjà vu. In addition, the characters are poorly developed. All good things should come to an end, but greed is the root of all evil. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Star Wars: O Despertar da Força" ("Star Wars: The Awekening of the Force")An Impressive Blockbuster Film...That Said I saw Quentin Tarentino on Stephen Colbert the other night. He pointed out that no matter what movie he's gone to, he always remembers that it is still a movie...that he never falls into the spell to where he forgets. People say they do. He doesn't. I deliberately stayed away from any reviews or comments on this film. But I couldn't avoid all of the hype and that hype, by its very nature, made me constantly aware I was watching a movie that was going to make huge sums of money. I'm having trouble separating myself from that sense of "why did they do this?" And "why did they choose her." And, "Isn't Harrison Ford a stitch." Not Han Solo but Harrison Ford. Anyway, I have to admit that I sort of enjoyed it. It has lots of action, some interesting characters, a nostalgic feel, and so on. And a force is a force of course, of course. I skipped work so I could be at the first screening of the first "Star Wars" film back in 1977. I have to admit that as a reader of much challenging science fiction, I found the whole thing pretty bland. But it is a cultural entity, it bears watching. I don't know that there was much new here that would make one want badly to come back for more. When I saw the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, I marked my calendar, hoping I would live to see all three episodes. And in that one, I already knew the plot. I'll be interested to see how this holds up to the test of time. For me the second set of the films are quite forgettable. And, again, for me, only one of the original caught my interest.Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens Disney paid over $4 billion to buy Lucasfilm, George Lucas himself served as creative consultant, I was super excited about a new movie, and the original stars returning, it was just a question of whether the acquisition was worth it, forget the prequels (no Jar Jar Binks), directed by J.J. Abrams (Lost, Mission: Impossible III, Star Trek, Super 8). Basically it's been 30 years since the destruction of the second Death Star, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last Jedi, has disappeared, the remains of the fallen Galactic Empire have risen and become The First Order, seeking to eliminate Skywalker and the Republic, the Resistance, backed by the Republic, are led by Luke's sister, Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), opposing the First Order and searching for Luke. On the planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) obtains a map to Luke's location from village elder Lor San Tekka (Max von Sydow), Stormtroopers, commanded by Kylo Ren (What If's Adam Driver), destroy the village and capture Poe, his droid BB-8 escapes with the map, and comes across scavenger Rey (introducing Daisy Ridley) at a junkyard settlement. The First Order Stormtrooper FN-2187 (Attack the Block's John Boyega) is unable to kill, gets away, frees Poe and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter, Poe gives him the new name "Finn". Poe and Finn crash on Jakku, Finn appears to be the only survivor, he finds Rey and BB-8 in the village, the First Order find them and attack, the three flee the planet in the stolen, rundown Millennium Falcon. Following a chase and escape, the Falcon breaks down and is captured by a larger ship, piloted by Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew and Joonas Suotamo), they reclaim their former ship, finding Rey and Finn, Han explains that Luke tried to rebuild the Jedi Order, but a student turned to the Dark Side, Luke went into exile and all he built was destroyed. The five escape on the Falcon when attacked by criminal gangs, the gangs inform the First Order of Han's involvement, the Falcon lands on the planet Takodana, the group meet cantina owner Maz Kanata (12 Years a Slave's Lupita Nyong'o), who can help BB-8 reach the Resistance, Rey finds Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, it also belonged to his father Anakin. The First Order have converted a planet into a superweapon capable of destroying star systems, Starkiller Base, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) orders General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) to use the weapon for the first time to destroy the Republic capital and its fleet, Snoke tells Ren he must kill his father, Han Solo. Takodana is attacked by the First Order, Finn uses the lightsaber in a fight, Resistance X-wing fighters save Finn, Han and Chewbacca, they are led by Poe, but Rey is captured and taken to Starkiller Base, she resists Ren's interrogation and mind-reading, and Rey discovers her powers of the Force, using a Jedi mind trick to escape her cell. Han, Chewbacca, Finn and BB-8 meet Leia at the Resistance base on D'Qar, droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) explains that R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) has been inactive since Luke's disappearance, the group learn that BB- 8's map to Luke's location is incomplete. The Resistance plan to lower the planetary shield of Starkiller Base, before it will fire on D'Qar, so the fighters can attack, Leia asks Han to bring their son back alive; Han, Chewbacca and Finn infiltrate the base in the Falcon, the shield is lowered and Rey is found, and explosives are set. They encounter Ren, Han confronts him, using his birth name Ben, and implores him to turn from the Dark Side, but Ren kills his father Han, Chewbacca shoots Ren and sets off the explosives, the Resistance X-wing fighters therefore attack the weapon and the Starkiller Base is destroyed in a chain reaction. Injured Ren chases Finn and Rey to the surface, Finn is injured in a fight using the lightsaber, Rey takes it and overpowers Ren, who is wounded, they are finally separated by the ground crumbling, Snoke orders General Hux to evacuate and bring Ren to him, while Rey, Chewbacca and Finn escape in the Falcon. The Resistance celebrate victory on On D'Qar, but Leia, Chewbacca and Rey mourn Han's death, R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, Rey follows this to an island on a distant planet, and there she finds Luke Skywalker, offering him his lightsaber. Also starring Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma, Simon Pegg as Unkar Plutt, Tim Rose as Admiral Ackbar (voiced by Erik Bauersfeld), Pip Torrens as Colonel Kaplan, Rocky Marshall as Colonel Datoo, Heroes' Greg Grunberg as Snap Wexley, The Raid's Yayan Ruhian as Tasu Leech, Sebastian Armesto as Lieutenant Mitaka, Warwick Davis as Wollivan, Saw's Ken Leung as Admiral Statura, The Raid's Iko Uwais as Razoo Quin-Fee, 30 Rock's Judah Friedlander as Bar Patron, Thomas Brodie-Sangster as First Order Officer, Bill Hader as BB-8 Voice Consultants, Daniel Craig as Stormtrooper JB-007 and Ewan McGregor as the voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Ford, Fisher and Hamill returning makes the nostalgia all the more fun, newcomers Ridley and Boyega are fantastic talents, and Driver a great choice for villain, supporting cast members do great as well. I was hoping the feel of the fantastic originals would be reignited, I'm happy to say it met all my expectations, the story is well written and played out, the chase and fight sequences are highly exciting, and the special effects are amazing, this truly is a return to the good old days and I cannot wait for the next, a brilliant science-fiction fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Williams, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Production Design, Best Original Music and Best Sound. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Outstanding!this is pretty much what I expected It was inevitable that they were going to milk the franchise long after the story assumed to be done. "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" brings back the characters from episodes 4-6 and adds some new ones. Given the frequent one-liners and self-references, I get the feeling that the aim is to make all the nerds/geeks have fun. I will say that unlike "The Phantom Menace", I understood the plot this time; with the former, I didn't understand the plot until I listened to "Weird Al" Yankovic's song "The Saga Begins" (a parody of "American Pie"). So, it's no masterpiece. The plot is mainly two hours of light saber fighting and shooting lasers. Basically, if you go in expecting nothing more than stuff that's meant to appeal to the characters on "The Big Bang Theory", then you won't be disappointed. If anything important came out of the movie, I'd say that it's Carrie Fisher's shutting down of people who have nothing better to do than comment on her age. That's all that I have to say about this movie.good news, it's a Star Wars movie. bad news... not too much (but some) So the good news to report first is that J.J. Abrams is someone who loves Star Wars enough that he more than respects the mythology, which itself is cobbled together from past mythological stories, both old (back to the Greeks with the Gods) and modern (serials and comics), but also recognizes that in this 'Episode' series as a saga a lot of it has to come back to family. The Force Awakens works tremendously when it focuses on the two (maybe three) new characters who are introduced in this series, and the familiar is both welcome and sometimes questionable, but mostly welcome all the same. It's a movie made for the fans, but it's not necessarily a "fan-film", if that makes sense. It's the logical progression of this franchise in 2015 and by a filmmaker like Abrams it's a commendable effort (if not great, read on for more, and of course SPOILERS be ahead). First of all, the first act of this movie is magnificent. New heroes are introduced, one of which, a deflecting Stormtrooper for the newly formed First Order named Finn (though it's technically not his real name, and oddly enough his given name is an in-joke for ANH fans), is remarkable. I loved this character as someone who did seem like a new presence - not someone who is a space pirate or destined for something greater, just a guy who was raised to do just one thing and has a conscience and decides to act on it. As played by John Boyega he's the best part of the movie overall for me (yes, even with mother-f***ing Han Solo and the new cute droid BB8 included), and he gives Finn passion and fire and occasional humor but is a fully formed character; he's fulfilling the promise seen in him in Attack the Block, and I can't wait to see more of his character in the next episodes. Likewise Daisy Ridley, a new actress relatively, is very good as Rey - though she at first is another character (or I should say archetype) that's familiar via Joseph Campbell as the Hero Destined for a Journey, Ridley gives her spunk and equal fire to Boyega, and it's a joy to see how they meet and join forces in the first act. Everything about this opening is so strong, a lot of it told without dialog (and when it does come in it feels simple but just right somehow) that it's a shame that the rest of the film doesn't quite live up. And it's not that the quality jumps off a cliff, but, for me, this first act of shaping this new world, the new evils (Adam Driver as the new sort of "Darth" Kylo Ren), hits its high point once Han Solo (Harrison Ford, acting like he'd never left the role, he's just there) and Chewbacca come in to the picture. In a way the 'spine' of the movie, in other words the events that lead everyone from point A to B to C, are really close to that of A New Hope. At the same time, I got the feeling like Abrams, probably knowing this would be his only shot at making a Star Wars movie (whether he wants to do one again is his call, but I believe he's declined), has put EVERYTHING he'd want to do in a SW movie in one film. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and Abrams passion for thios world comes through in almost every frame. But it almost feels a little cramped by the time the last act comes around and as our heroes face off against Kylo Ren (following the death of a pretty damn prominent character, sort of in keeping with the family-tragedy line of the series, I can't even bring myself to say it), there's the "Starkiller" Base, which is basically the Death Star on steroids. It's a much darker film than I expected. Matter of fact, the third act has the sort of pacing issues to the point I almost forgot about the Starkiller Base plan, and it had not really much urgency considering its level of threat. It's also a little unclear just how FAST a particular character gets Jedi-Force powers (the explanation of Rey having them is fine, but it seems like just how quickly is too much, as if she would need more, say, training to do ALL that she does, and comes off more like a story contrivance). And by the time it gets to this section of the film, where emotions are really high but callbacks are still done - even to things like, say, a trash compactor, or an Admiral Ackbar appearance - it's a bit much. The number of gripes that I can ponder over are many... and yet I still recommend the film highly. For all the little faults in the storytelling or little bits of deus ex machina (at one point involving a split in the ground that separates two characters in a dual at just the right moment), this is a full-bloodied, extremely well directed, shot with fire in the cinematographer's cortex (and a lack of unnecessary lens flares!) Star Wars movie. In the ways that ultimately count, in the spine as I mentioned, its familiarity is in keeping with how this saga has been unfolding over six films, with familial bonds and the mystical element of the Force guiding things in directions of good and/vs evil. It does what the 2009 Star Trek film, also from Abrams, did so well: reintroduce us to this universe with energy and spunk, give fans and newcomers what they want, and allow some new actors to act their buts off while giving veterans a chance to shine. Oh, and BB8 is cute as a button. If only R2 had more screen time for them as a buddy-droid team...The search for Skywalker Thirty years after the destruction of the second Death Star and the overthrow of the Empire a new force has risen from its ashes; the First Order. Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, has disappeared and both the First Order and rebels, who are now known as The Resistance are searching for him. A map to his location has been found and given to rebel pilot Poe Dameron but the First Order's storm troopers attack before he can get it back to the resistance he gives the map to his droid, BB-8, and tells it to get far away. Dameron is captured buy the sinister Kylo Ren but is helped to escape by defecting storm trooper FN-2187, soon renamed Finn. Their flight doesn't get them far though; they crash and it looks as though Dameron is dead. Meanwhile BB-8 is found by a scavenger named Rey; she shortly meets with Finn and, thinking he is in the resistance they manage to escape in a familiar ship. Their journey to the resistance base will bring them into contact with some familiar characters and into many life of death situations. We also learn why Luke has disappeared and the connection between Kylo Ren and the central trio from the original 'Star Wars' films. Anybody who has seen the original 'Star Wars' film will find the plot of this film very similar; this may be a problem for some viewers but I found myself really enjoying this and think it was probably the best film in the series since 'The Empire Strikes Back' it is helped by the lack of things like Ewoks and Jar Jar Binks! The new characters were pretty impressive, in particular Rey and Finn. Their characters developed nicely through the film; this was particularly true of Rey as she starts to discover her strength in using The Force; thankfully the writers didn't rush to explain why she was so strong; no doubt we'll learn in later films. It was great to see many original characters even though Luke's appearance can best be described as a cameo or even a teaser as to what is to come in episode eight. While the overall story doesn't feature any major twists there is one very surprising moment for those who have managed to avoid spoilers. The cast does a solid job; newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega were great as Rey and Finn and of the original cast members Harrison Ford stands out as he has the most prominent role. The film features plenty of exciting action as some humorous moments which thankfully don't feel too forced. Overall I really enjoyed this film and heartily recommend it to fans of the original films.looks like a lot of people really hated it Somehow, even with all the hatred, Star Wars: The Force Awakens managed to bring in 2 billion.  Obviously the box office is no indication of whether or not a movie is good. The appeal was the reuniting of the original cast - Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Luke Hamill, along with Chewie and 3CPO, and to introduce some new characters to carry on in the next films. I have to admit, it looked like a big video game to me. What I enjoyed the most was Ford, particularly his repartee with Chewy. For me, it was great to see Fisher and Hamill again. These films that take place in space are yesterday's westerns and war movies. It used to be the science fiction films, the Buck Rogers, Superman, Dick Tracy etc., were B movies. Once the computer and CGI came in, they quickly became A films, perfect for the big screen.  Someone once told me that most movies are made for 15-year-old boys in Thailand. It makes sense - I mean, what was there to grasp about this film that a 15-year-old non-English speaking person couldn't grasp?  I haven't followed this franchise much since the first three films, though I did see the Anakin Skywalker-Natalie Portman movie. I think it's fairly obvious that this film brings us back to the original Star Wars.  Harrison Ford was paid $10,000 for the first Star Wars. His salary is higher now and he has a percentage of the box office. He's old, he looks old, but you can't beat him. He's an old-fashioned movie star in an old-fashioned movie. I didn't feel that Carrie Fisher had enough to do though I enjoyed her. So why give this an 8? Why? It was fun, it was entertaining, I loved the original stars. The new people -- Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac are all attractive and are very good. Will I go and see the next Star Wars? Probably, because Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are in it and somehow, so is Harrison Ford. That to me is Star Wars."This is not how I thought the day was gonna go." I've taken my time getting to this review, having seen the movie twice and allowing nearly three thousand other reviewers take their shot at the picture. I have mixed feelings about "The Force Awakens". As a stand alone movie I think it works well enough. It's got the CGI enhanced battle action down pat and the new characters add some fresh blood to the Star Wars universe which most of us expected. This is where I think I'll insert the 'but'..... To quote Han Solo from my summary line above - "This is not how I thought the day was gonna go." Another way to say it is - "Where was the magic"? I think I probably speak for anyone old enough to have been around for the original "Star Wars" in 1977. The first time you saw a land cruiser, or a hologram image of Princess Leia, or walked into the Mos Eisley cantina - man, that was magic. The legend of Obi Wan Kenobi had a mystery to it and you couldn't wait for that mystery to reveal itself. With this movie, it doesn't feel like the principals involved were interested in exploring a distant galaxy far, far away, instead directing their energy to the land of here and now. There wasn't so much a story here as the next evolution in computer generated special effects and characters created to appeal to a diverse cross section of movie goers. All well and good, but I think most Star Wars fans would welcome some serious character development and a story arc that anticipates an eventful wind up to the Star Wars saga. I don't expect that we'll get that now. Here's the one thing that did intrigue me out of the whole movie though, and I haven't read anyone else comment on it. When Han Solo follows Kylo Ren out to the bridge of the Star Killer base, he shouts out 'BEN' to which his son responds. See, this is the magic I was talking about earlier. It sounded to me like Kylo Ren was named after Ben Kenobi. If only the rest of the story could have been that cool.The Seventh Awakens Although if you either dismiss Episode 1-3 it could also be "the fourth Awakens". But back to this one and let me begin with, that I'm not even close to being in the top of the biggest fans, when it comes to Star Wars. I came late to the party and enjoyed the movies (some more, some less) and am not obsessed with the whole thing. Always liked Han Solo, especially the way Ford portrayed him. Having said that and not being able to be too detailed on every little inside joke, I can tell you that this feels like a Star Wars movie to me. Maybe it's on the surface and maybe some feel it is even too close to the Originals (copying certain things, paying respect as others would describe it). It's just the beginning of a new trilogy and 2016 has another Star Wars movie lined up, that is more of a spin off. So to see what the repercussions are (for surviving characters), you'll have to wait until 2017. As it is and as cliché as some things go down (like our main "bad guy" here, so misunderstood as he would possibly say himself) and as predictable as others are, you will have a couple of wow moments and giving the new female lead some power to be doing stuff rather than just being there, this has a lot going for it. Maybe not the best Star Wars movie out there and interestingly enough the reaction was either love or hate (do people really think of this being worse than Episode 1? Wow). Embrace it for what it is, because it does capture what George Lucas was trying to do back in the day ...Pleasant and entertaining throwback to the 1970s Star Wars movies. My wife and I enjoyed this at home on DVD from our local public library. JJ Abrams did a good job directing this movie mostly in the style of the original Star Wars movies beginning in 1977. I've been around long enough to remember them well and the positive stir they created. I had a good friend who became a giant fan of the robot C3PO, who also makes an appearance here, 38 years after the original. Most of the running time and action involve a set of new, mostly younger actors. The bad guys want to control the galaxy (far, far away) and part of their plan is to find and eliminate Luke Skywalker, believed to be hidden away in a remote location. A map, stored on a solid state device, is the key. For me the most fun was their bringing back the main actors (and their characters) from the originals. Harrison Ford, who was in his 30s when all this started, is now in his 70s as Han Solo. His old ship, the Millennium Falcon relegated to a junkyard, serves a key role in the battles and as an escape vehicle.  Mark Hamill is back as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher is back as Princess Leia who has become a general, and Peter Mayhew, all 7 feet and 3 inches of him, is back as Chewbacca. Good movie and very entertaining, we enjoyed it. SPOILERS: Solo and Leia have a son, who has inherited some of his grandfather's (Darth Vader) powers is also leading the effort of the bad guys. There is a confrontation between him and Solo, where dad is trying to talk him into abandoning the dark side, but the son puts his lightsaber through Han who apparently then falls to his death.Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a good continuation of the series as it left off from 30 years ago As someone who grew up watching the original trilogy (that's the ones from '77-'83 that starred Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher), I was a little stoked to watch this one with those three returning. Ford appears the most in this and he makes the most of his presence. The funniest lines are from him and it's such a joy when he's on screen. Ms. Fisher doesn't seem as charismatic as in her previous stints as Leia but she's still pretty good at what she's required being now an older version of her. She and Ford have some nice scenes together. Hamill doesn't appear much so we'll have to wait for the next one in the series to see how he fares though I did like his beard at the end. The new players, mainly Finn and Rey, are good enough as characters. J.J. Abrams does a good enough job taking over for George Lucas. This was quite exciting for me and my movie theatre-working friend. So on that note, I recommend Star Wars: The Force Awakens.Episode VIII had better be fantastic. A fairly long time ago, in a county not so far away (Elstree Studios are an hour's drive away from yours truly), a great adventure took place. Now, J.J. Abrams, in league with the 'House of Mouse', has returned to make a seventh chapter in the franchise, and it's almost identical in plot to the first film, but with only a fraction of the magic and charm. Daisy Ridley plays Luke sorry, I mean Rey a scavenger on the desert planet of Tatooinesorry, I mean Jakku who becomes involved in the rebellion against The Empire sorry I mean The First Order after she bumps into R2D2 sorry, I mean BB-8, a droid carrying plans to the death star sorry, I mean to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. Meanwhile, the First Order are preparing their new weapon, the Death Star sorry, I mean Starkiller Base for use against the rebellion, who are forced to launch a risky counter-attack that sees Rey coming face-to-face with masked villain Darth Vadersorry, I mean Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). I've learnt to keep my expectations low for Star Wars films since The Phantom Menace, so I can't say The Force Awakens was a massive disappointment; it is what I feared it would be—a rather safe reboot, lacking in fresh ideas, which aims to please younger viewers with flashy visuals, whilst pandering to the older generation by including sly nods to the original trilogy. Personally, I would much rather they had taken a bolder approach: let's be honest they couldn't have got it any more wrong than the prequels. There's a spark of originality in the form of Finn (John Boyega), a stormtrooper who has a change of heart and joins the rebellion, the production design and effects are incredible, and I admit that the return of Han Solo and Chewbacca warmed even my cynical heart, but on the whole I was left wanting by this latest instalment, particularly the final assault on the Starkiller Base, which was completely bereft of tension. In fact, my favourite moment of the whole film is when Carrie Fisher tries to convey anguish, but her plastic surgery doesn't let her.Luke rewrites Matthew This is a replacement comment for the one written on opening night. I've had a chance to see it again, this time in 3D, and of course think about it. The big picture here is that the creative team made a modern film in the sense that it is folded, meaning it is about itself and how it presents other films. There are hundreds of examples of this of course, but this is the biggest movie in history, so something important is going on. In thousands of comments here, I've remarked on this new development, where more and more films have introspective dynamics. We are changing how we think, managing thoughts on at least two levels: the story and the story about the story, or how the story is presented. There is real power in this, because such introspection is a half step away from seeing yourself while being yourself, and that is half a step away from what might be called living the force. An example: the story in this film had to recycle elements from the previous ones (actually just the first two). What is our heroine about but literally scavenging elements from the prior films? Throughout, the term 'scavenger' is used as an insult but Rey carries it proudly. She clearly knows something about herself we don't. Our first scene with her matters. We have been transported with captured Poe into the hanger bay of a star destroyer, which Poe finds impressive. Immediately after, we have Rey rappelling into an identical bay from the last Star Wars saga. She will later fly through this and other parts of that wreckage.  About the handling of space. Other than story details, this had to have been much chewed over, because since the original films, our conventions of what a camera is have changed. The original two films were themselves intended to be retro in how they handled the camera. In 1977, the techniques attributed to Hitchcock and Welles were common, where the camera was no longer passive. It became our representative in the film, subtly indicating what we would do if we were there, or what role we would play. The camera could be curious, for instance, show revulsion or fascination. Lucas chose to have the camera be as it was in the 40's. This is one reason dePalma and Coppola thought the movie stunk. But that and the practical effects worked for us, indeed became part of what we loved. Now flash forward to a time where no action movie can be made without the active camera, the camera as our representative. What balance does Abrams find, but to have two film philosophies interwoven. In all the 'character' scenes, the effects are mostly practical and the camera is retro. In all the action scenes, the effects are mostly GCI and the camera is the modern one. The difference is striking because Lucas used a 1930 Howard Hughes dogfight movie as his template for the space battles. Here we still have spacecraft moving as if they were biplanes moving fast, but the weaves among them and among the camera are modern. (This was pioneered by Pixar, and their direct influence is obvious in the 3D version.) One final observation on the story reflecting the film itself. When Lucas and Kurtz invented the characters for the first film, they paid a lot of attention to archetypes. Most commonly cited is the work of Joseph Campbell but they more deeply studied the most popular of these, the Jesus story. (They didn't mention this for obvious reasons.) Think of Mark as history and each of the following gospels as episodes that added to the story. Mark (without the later ending) is about a preacher of parables with no special birth and no resurrection. Matthew in the next episode adds a virgin birth, influence from Persia and Egypt (then considered magical) and rising from the dead. Where Mark had him in the Nazarene desert, Matthew brought him into cosmic battle. The third episode written as 'history' emphasized Jesus role in building an order of followers, whose collective adherence to (lets call it) the force will sweep over the planet and redeem it. The devil appears here with his own order, the 'first order' chronologically created. One might assume that the name Luke Skywalker was random, or that it mirrored Lucas' name. But this is not the case, and this is something Kasdan understood. All he did was give us the Jesus story filtered through Kurosawa. Why mention this? Because Kasdan is again on the case and what he does is metaphorically overlay Luke on Matthew, giving us both.Finally...the Force awakens! Acclaimed J.J. Abrams directs and co-writes this STAR WARS installment. I remember watching the original with my best friend in 1977 and agreed this is a spectacle. What a hallowed franchise it has become. Although not being a faithful follower, my perspective of THE FORCE AWAKENS probably will leave a lot to be desired. Three decades have passed since the last episode had Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill)decide to hideout on a small mountainous island. Harrison Ford returns as a matured, and yet still charming, Hans Solo. Time as not served Leia(Carrie Fisher)well, although now the princess is a general who leads the Resistance. Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew)is still one of the most likable sidekicks ever. C3PO and R2D2 still look the same. Two likable characters will more than earn their entry into the franchise; John Boyega(Finn)is an AWOL stormtrooper, who meets a beautiful scavenger named Rey(Daisy Ridley), who has crafty skills equal to the best of any fighter. Poe Dameron(Oscar Issac)is a devoted pilot of the Resistance working for Leia. And a new malevolence, the First Order, spawns from the ruins of the Empire. FX are definitely special in the grand fashion one would expect. So much frantic action it is hard to find a place to sneak away for popcorn or soft drink refills. The detractors of this movie will be, of course, way out numbered by the serious Star Wars fanatics. The story line not exactly simple; but sustains the free thinkers with wide open imagination. Others in this cast of hundreds(maybe thousands): Max von Sydow, Adam Driver, Gwendoline Christie, Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyongo, Nick Walters, Dante Briggins, Dombhnall Gleeson and even Daniel Craig plays a stormtrooper. This movie proves to be one not to be missed. You don't even have to be a Star Wars fan. And definitely worth watching more than once.The next generation Star Wars is Fan-Tastic! One can only have deep respect and admiration for a genius individual like J.J. Abrams I think one of the most difficult things to accomplish in the film industry is to revive a legendary and immeasurably popular franchise, but Abrams achieved in doing so not just once – with "Star Trek" – but now twice, with the even more astounding new "Star Wars" installment. "Star Trek" and "Star Wars" aren't just your average type of successful Sci-Fi movies, no, they became so humongous that they became immortal cult phenomena with millions of obsessive fans, countless of spin-offs and imitations and merchandising business that started to lead a life of their own. In order to appeal to this many skeptical and demanding fans, your film just has to be really, REALLY good! "Episode VII: The Force Awakens" is a fantastic film, and even though I'm not an avid "Star Wars" admirer, it was the first one since "The Empire Strikes Back" that truly impressed and overwhelmed me. Episodes I, II and III, that were released between 1999 and 2005 and directed by George Lucas himself, were not exactly worshiped by the die-hard SW-fans. Arguably that's because Mr. Lucas wrote and directed the prequels from a creator's point of view and not enough from a fan-boy's perspective. Abrams clearly is a big fan of the saga and probably knows more about Lucas' creation than he does himself, and that makes him the ideal person to helm the next generation of Star Wars cinema. "The Force Awakens" has a solid and absorbing scenario, breathtaking decors and set-pieces, spectacular action scenes (brought to an even higher level of awesomeness thanks to the exquisite 3D) and – perhaps the most important of all – a truly excellent and versatile cast of characters. First and foremost there's the return of some legendary heroes, of course, like Han Solo and Chewbacca, but also the newly introduced protagonists are fascinating characters. Personally, I've always been most attracted to the Dark Side, so I adored the new and powerful foe Kylo Ren (and particularly his private mental battle), the relentless army General Hux and the rather disturbing Supreme Leader Snoke. But also the good guys are extremely likable, like tough girl Rey and the reshaped Stormtrooper Finn. I can't wait for episodes 8 and 9!Slumber Earthquake. There really is no point trying to do an in depth review of this, it falls in line with a number of series blockbusters that are guaranteed to garner rabid responses, pro and con.  The Force Awakens is a film of many flaws, it has a pungent whiff of safeness about it, the charges of it being a glitzy remake are fair enough, while certain plot strands are frustrating and set to be big talking points for years - and years - to come. Yet what about its worth to someone who is not obsessed with every finer detail? Someone who just loves the Star Wars universe as a spectacle prism of entertainment, and has just wanted a Star Wars film worthy of being fit to sit alongside that original trilogy? This made me feel 11 again, took me back to a time in 1977 when I queued for three hours to see such wonders on the big screen. The Force Awakens is, in spite of the recognised flaws, a loving homage to a past love. It's sly with humour and nods to foundations, a blitzkrieg of effects and sound work (my Blu-ray viewing had my sub-woofer doing a jitterbug in the lounge), and it doesn't shy from surprise or the dangling of the carrot. The makers have big heart and technical invention, the cast vibrant, spunky and strongly committed to the cause - the old hands a very reassuring presence - Yeah, so it's not sci-fi perfection, or any Star Wars geeks' idea of the perfect Star Wars movie (oh J.J. Abrams you devil you!), but it made this middle aged guy shed a tear of happiness. A moment to reaffirm why - as a young lad - I fell in love with film in the first place. 9/10A Star Wars Reunion Movie The release of Star Wars this year is definitely going provide a lot of excitement especially for the people who have been given a lot of entertainment and enjoyment by series of movie that have been released in the 70's,80's and 90's. But this time,a lot of the fans are highly anticipating this movie because it will definitely the stars from the first installment of the Star Wars trilogy that are appearing like Harrison Ford,Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher.It will be sort of a like a reunion movie especially since the last movie that they have made was more than 30 years ago. Star Wars: The Force Awakens which is also known as Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens will take off thirty years after the events that occurred after Star Wars: Episode VI -The Return Of The Jedi.The First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to eliminate the New Republic which is backed by The Resistance,which is led by General Leia Organa.She opposes them and starts to search for her twin brother to enlist his aid.The story progresses with General Leia's search for Luke Skywalker. Well,it was an enjoyable movie.No question about it.We are treated to better cinematic effects and better production values especially with Disney in charge of this trilogy.Added to that,we are also treated to great storytelling that would definitely reignite the fans' enjoyment of the up-and-coming series.Although I must say that we are going to be treated to the same formula which have made it successful and it would not be something new which many disappointed fans expected,it was still a great joy to see something updated for the modern audiences and done successfully.Personally,I think that there is no need to change the formula for as the saying goes,"Why fix it if it ain't broke?"A new hype 1977 was a big year in the cinema. Star Wars (later titled Episode IV-A New Hope) came out. It was a big year for me as well. I went to see my first James Bond film in the cinema. Star Wars I saw some years later on television, which as my brother said 20 minutes in. It is just some characters walking in the desert. JJ Abrams who ran out of ideas by the time he went on to direct Star Trek: Into Darkness has not waited long to reuse old ideas for Star Wars 7. Just as Creed carries on the Rocky saga by going back to Rocky 1 &amp; 2, Abrams with Lawrence Kasdan &amp; Michael Arndt has gone back to A New Hope to set up this new trilogy. We are back to the world of Star Wars and with advances in technology, special effects, CGI and animatronics we have not advanced much in visuals from the original trilogy which is over 30 years old from The Return of the Jedi. The visuals are uninspired and rather lazy. We have a Tattooine like planet where a young woman, Rey meets a droid carrying important information regarding Luke Skywalker. Rey comes across Finn a storm-trooper who has had a reawakening of his own and met a rebel fighter to escape. Rey seems to be feeling the force and in a series of coincidences or I guess the power of the force escapes her pursuers in a wreck which turns out to be the Millennium Falcon and later comes across Han Solo and Chewbacca. That is not all the Darth Vader like baddie is the grandson of Darth Vader, the son of Han and Princess Leia who has gone over to the dark side but still conflicted with the power of good. Their will be a father and son reunion and you can all guess how this will turn out as the scene is reminiscent of when Obi Wan encountered Darth Vader. It is entertaining, they put on all the right beats with action scenes coming at the right time and some humour, star cameos such as Daniel Craig voicing a storm-trooper or an actress, Harriet Walter who is the niece of Christopher Lee. It is just the story has been recycled and you think that after 30 years, this is the best they could do? If Lucas wanted a new trilogy he might has well remastered and re- edited his original trilogy because I know where this is heading.The best episode since the original trilogy (This review contains a SPOILER at the end!) I watched it last Saturday at TGV Cinema, Cyberjaya. To me, being a Star Wars fan since childhood (I was 4 when I watched the original Star Wars in 1978) this episode brought my childhood back during the 2 hour plus duration (unlike the prequel trilogy!). All the favourites were there: Han Solo, Leia, Chewie, Luke, R2-D2, C3-PO, etc. And the new cast were great as well. It had it all - exciting battles and lightsaber action, family drama (soap opera in space?), etc. I must admit - I cried when Han met Leia again and my wife was amazed looking at my reaction! I would give it a 5 out of 5 stars. Perhaps the only disappointment I had was at the end when Rey met with Luke (is Luke going to reveal that he is her father in the next episode?) and he didn't utter a word! Anyway, great job JJ Abrams and team, and to be honest, I can't wait for the next installment (Episode VIII)!Disappointment Before I saw the movie, I'd already read some bad reviews. I'm a huge SW fan so I decided to go see it. I couldn't believe how poorly made this film was. Acting was mediocre to say the least with the exception of the droids and Chewbacca. The old cast trio acted very little in the film, especially Mark Hamil who appears only a couple of minutes. The light saber fighting scenes were poor and uninspired. I don't want to go into EU, non-canon issues as that's a personal opinion. For me it was a bad mistake not to follow the EU with all the epic material out there. I mean there is material right there, served on a golden platter. The villains were weak as it's usually the case with Disney's movies, all talk but no backbone. To have the main villain, the leader of the "First Order", be defeated by a girl who never touched a light saber before in her life... that spells disaster in my books. Where is the ominous presence of Darth Vader, Count Dooku, Darth Sidious, Obi Wan etc.? Where is the epic atmosphere of the previous films? What of this "Supreme Leader Snoke"? He looks like Gollum! Where on the galaxy did they find Luke's/Anakin's light saber and stored it in a chest in a basement?? That light saber was cut off Luke's hand and dropped in the chasm of Bespin's bottom (probably down in the ocean) in episode V. How did Kylo Ren find Darth Vader's mask? That was burned on the moon of Endor some 30 years ago. Finally the story. Ah the story, it seemed to me I was watching a remake of Episode IV... come on! Another bigger, badder Death "Planet"... No background, no nothing. I really do hope, George Lucas buys back the franchise, disavows this film, and makes a proper one. I give it a 2/10 grade, 1 for the SW logo and 1 for the past films. No more.Great film with some minor Flaws ** Spoiler Free**  This movie is great , people are complaining its a New hope remake and I was worried about it , but after seeing the film I can tell you with all honesty is a DAMN good film and a excellent star wars movie. -the good- X-wing vs tie fighter fights, Light-saber fights are emotional , Great humor , Great Villains -the bad- some characters needed more screen time , the score is not bad but for a john Williams score i was underwhelm , Some scenes are cut too fast (cant Appreciate all the creatures)  -the ugly- some CGI characters stood out too much because everything else are practical effects.A New Hidden Fortress Awakens feat. Voldemort and Professor Snape How come, when JJ Abrams and co. set out to continue the saga, they felt the best option was to simply remake A New Hope, which already was a re-imagining of Kurosawa's classic 'The Hidden Fortress'. Now we end up with three movies that are practically the same. What sets this movie apart from A New Hope is the inclusion of Voldemort, Professor Snape, a far more saturated image, steadicam and lens-flare overkill, a far more pronounced machine vs. nature theme (general Organa? wtf? Lets not make star wars into Avatar please) and an inverted "I'm your father complex" times two. I've been a long time fan of the original Starwars trilogy, like many others, and when I saw the first ratings of this movie I was stoked. It started out pretty good, but as the movie went along it became utterly frustrating because of the sheer laziness that went into constructing the plot. If you've never seen the original trilogy (which you should, obviously) and you're only familiar with the current trend of the over the top, candy-esque, box-office spectacles, you'd probably enjoy this movie. As for me, I'm not sure if I'm going to continue to follow the new saga. I'll probably stick with the original (despecialized) trilogy.awful star wars movie ever first of all new charters are very weak ,starting new bad boy :),girl and new boy is also looks like coming from cheap TV show series second, movie start very good first hour was good then suddenly you start to get bored and telling your self what is going on :) i really get very excited when i first hear new star wars movie coming and ,when i was watching the movie i pray the god to make me blind . i don't like the director when i first hear he will direct new star wars i said no , and bingo i was right please be honest your self and do not vote because it is just star wars new series what is the problem in Hollywood i don't know but nowadays we are watching just propaganda movies or expensive production but boring story based movies please if you gonna make our favourite movies worse please do not make it like terminator 3 etc pleaseThe Force put me asleep. I've never done this before but I can't stand it anymore so I had to write something about SWVII. So for those who care to read it this is my take on the last Star Wars. Warning spoilers are included for those who haven't seen it yet. The only good thing about this film to me is the female lead. She's good and she has the right tough temper. Overall I'm very disappointed because of the lack of imagination. This film is mostly a copy/paste of the 1977 episode IV. Remember the droid sent with something hidden in it and found by Luke ? It's really disappointing that with a universe like that writers in Hollywood can't come up with something new, original and creative. But anyway that's what Disney does all the time (copy/paste good film recipes), so that's what they wanted and that's what they did. We even have to stand the same old « I disable the shields so that you can destroy the death star » which we've seen three times now ! It's so boring. The only surprise is that the death star is bigger ! Wow shocking ! The other weaknesses in the film are : - The Bad guy looks strong at the beginning which is promising but then gets his ass easily kicked by a girl who's not even a Jedi yet ! - The phony and unoriginal « last Jedi location map » and one piece of the puzzle map missing. - The Han Solo'son and reverse father/son relationship is predictable cheap and doesn't work for me. - It's nice to put Harrison Ford back in but he's there too much sorry. And now to compensate that he can't have the same action scenes as before they have added humour. Some are good but it's way too much. Sometimes it made me feel like I was watching a Star Wars parody. Also because Han Solo is an important character it creates an unbalance in the story since the true heroes are Finn and Rey. The light saber is a holly thing to me and that's what they want to show when Rey touches it for the first time and the all idea of going to this island to bring it back to Luke. But then why does the old woman proposes Rey to take it since she doesn't even know her much or it appears so ? Why also is it so simply passing to the hands of Finn so he can have fun with it a little ? It's nice coming up with the idea that Finn is a storm trooper who wants to break free but how do you make us buy that ? Why does he so easily escapes ? Why all the others don't do like he does ? Why is he the only one that thinks « oh my god I'm killing innocent people I have to stop » ? The beginning of the film up to the moment when Han Solo is coming back was promising then the Force put me asleep If you want to see good truly imaginative, and gripping Star Wars films watch episodes IV, V, VI.The worst episode of all saga This is a very bad episodes for this saga. Inserting a funny afro American is a classic Hollywood stuff for a world wide pop up. Repeated story from the old episodes, really? For all this years they didn't design a original story. Don't know, but this is a big disappointment. Can't understand 8.5/10 for this comedy. Too much similar parts in the movie from the old episodes. OK, this is a movie for the kids right, but there is a too much aggregation for them. Don't know, but simple can't take this movie for a good, i hear too much laugh in the cinema hall for projection this movie like for a some Monty Python movie. Acting is good, but really John Boyega aka Finn is excess.Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Cringe List One fan's nit-picking is another's death by a thousand cuts.  1) Cool. Max von Sydow is in this, and he just said he needs to "make things right." This should be an interesting back-story! Oh, wait. They just killed him. Into the Mystery Box with the interesting back-story, Mystery-Wrapped until season, er, EPISODE 8 at the earliest, when I think we'll also learn about the Hatch.  2) Stormtroopers have advanced beyond quaint sci-fi blaster tech to embrace flame throwers and Tasers. Finally.  3) Yay! It's the Millennium Falcon! Wait how'd it get on Tatooine 2? Relax: I'm sure it's NOT just a convenient coincidence. There has to be a plausible explanation coming.  4) Cool! Rey is a bad-ass pilot! Oh, but, how does a teenage junk collector become an ace spaceship flier? I bet there's a Beggar's Canyon 2 on Tatooine 2! Or womp rats! Either way, I'm sure an explanation is forthcoming.  5) Why is the Falcon in perfect working order after sitting unprotected on the surface of a blistering sand planet for umpteen years? Obviously, Han went for the Clear Coat option.  6) Wow, in addition to the Clear Coat, the Millennium Falcon must have been majorly reinforced in the past 30 years, because it's now slamming against the ground and not completely disintegrating like most other spaceships that have previously slammed against the ground in this particular galaxy.  7) Did Finn really look toward the camera and say "Woo!" like he just crushed it in Call of Duty?  8) Oh sh**. Still no mention of a Beggar's Canyon 2 or womp rats. Oh well, another file for the Mystery Box!  9) And still no reason given for the famous Millennium Falcon's convenient parking spot on the same planet where all three of our fresh-faced protagonists converge. Another one for the Mystery Box (subject line: "For Smoke Monster Eyes Only").  10) Yay! It's Han Solo and Chewie! Wait how did they manage to track the Millennium Falcon and then hyperspace jump directly to it 30 seconds after it took off from Tatooine 2? Faster- than-light-spaceship-tracking-and-travel has really come a long way in 30 years!  11) Finn didn't just ask if Rey has a "boyfriend," did he? Ugh, he did. Maybe they will later "hook up" in a spacemaltshop?  12) For a soldier indoctrinated from childhood to be a ruthless cog in the First Order killing machine, Finn seems to be a remarkably well-adjusted and affable lad, quick with the good- times one-liners.  13) Why does that one gang of space pirates sound like the cast of Trainspotting? And why does that other gang of space pirates LOOK and sound like the cast of The Raid 2? Dammit, why am I thinking about these other movies in the middle of a Star Wars movie? I don't want to think about hardscrabble Glasgow and gritty Indonesian street fighting right now. 14) Those escaped tentacle monsters look like Kang and Kodos from the Simpsons Halloween specials. Only more cartoony.  15) Why did Kang and Kodos immediately kill and devour the Scottish gangsters and the Indonesian Kung Fu gangsters, but not Finn? It's probably because he's so damn well-adjusted and affable.  16) Wow, Rey is also a master mechanic who can fix the Millennium Falcon better than Han and Chewie. It's almost like she's a Mary Sue, or something. But JJ Abrams and Jake Kasdan's dad are not ladies, so by definition, that theory would make no sense at all, and I'm probably a sexist pig for even considering it.  17) Finn, a First Order conscientious objector, apparently has no objection to slaughtering his former First Order comrades. And quite affably, at that.  18) Kylo Ren is talking to Stimpy the big Gollum hologram (Gollugram?) now. Ouch: People in the audience are chuckling at Gollugram's hammy stage voice. Now I'm chuckling, too. Dammit, JJ! I didn't want to chuckle at this point in the movie.  19) Why is Gollugram so damn big? Oh no: This better not turn out to be an Oz thing. And why does this CGI look so shitty? Oh, right: An industry friend told me two weeks before this movie's release that, despite JJ's claim that the film was in the can, little visual effects elves were still furiously working overtime on it.  20) Christ, another Cantina scene? This time with Broadway space reggae. I f***ing can't believe they went with another Cantina scene. Wait, while I was obsessing over this offensive victory lap of another Cantina scene, I missed why they decided to bring BB-8, the galaxy's most-wanted droid, into the Cantina instead of hiding him on the g-d space ship.  21) Oh no. More rush-job CGI in the orange Yoda. Looks like the effects elves cranked the subsurface scattering up to 11, because Mazda Yoda looks all watery-swimmy. 22) OK, why is Rey hearing spooky children crying in the basement? Is this like Lord of the Rings now, where magic inanimate objects have a voice? I thought Obi Wan said that the Force binds all LIVING things. Why does a hunk of metal now channel Force powers? 23) Finn just looked toward the camera and lovingly gushed, "That is a damn good pilot," as if he saw the cross-cuts of his his pal Poe in the cockpit along with the rest of us. And why did he look at the camera to say that? Does he want me to shout back, "Yes, I agree!"?  24) Oh for f***'s sake, I give up. (Storms out of theater.)Feel the Force once again... LOVED IT! There were many things I loved about this movie. As one who truly WAS THERE back in May of 1977 and who saw the first film 365 times in the theaters, Force Awakens was a trip back in time to reconnect with characters and a storyline from a galaxy long missed. Shot on FILM??? HELLO??? BREAKTHROUGH!! There's a vast difference in visual quality alone as well as those themes which weave through the storyline, you know when you're touching the spirit of those who were in previous films. No spoilers at all from this fan, I will simply say that I cannot wait until the digital version which I have already Pre-ordered surfaces so that I can watch it once again and reconnect with the vibe of the film. Many today for who this is their first exposure to Star Wars should watch the first trilogy, then the second, and then watch Force Awakens so the connect with the various homages to those films which exist in this one. Can't wait for the next Episode and I look forward to being able to see the final film of this new trilogy before I leave this lifetime. Enjoy the film and simply let yourself go into the world of that galaxy, far, far, away... and most of all...FEEL THE FORCEStar Wars is back! Very good movie. The prequels were so awful, this movie is such fun and a wonderful addition to the Star Wars family. The acting was excellent... such a change from the poorly acted prequels. The special effects were incredible and I loved the new robot. Just wish the movie didn't follow the original Star Wars movie so closely. But I'm sure the next movie will surprise us with wonderful new planets and lots of intriguing characters. It was so awesome seeing Han and Leia and Luke... and of course Chewbacca and the robots. i just hope the Death Star doesn't get used in any future movies... or if it is mentioned it's not the entire focus of the movie. But overall a fun movie to watch and I can't wait for the next movie.Guess the episode This is my first ever review on any movie on IMDb. So this means it's serious. So without spoiling it much here it goes: Just came home from the cinema, waited for this movie for so long and finally I can say that I've watched it. I should be ecstatic, overwhelmed, feeling like a little kid again, full of wonder and excitement and ready to boldly go where no man has gone before Instead I feel scammed. Without spoiling much of the movie – I know, it's practically impossible to spoil it now, a week after its global release – I will try to explain why this was NOT the Star Wars I was expecting to see. As soon I left the theater a friend of mine asked me how it was. I replied with a 6/10. This was a conservative estimated score. The more I think about this movie, the lower it goes. Before you jump on my throat with a light saber, let me justify this. We were waiting for this movie for so long. The hype train behind it reached Trans-Siberian levels of anticipation. We demanded a damn good Star Wars movie, after the horrendous last three, we needed this one to be as good – at least! – as the original ones. Having taken this into consideration, we also expected this one to surpass the original trilogy. The year is 2015 and visually there is almost nothing that cannot be done. Almost 40 years since we first saw a star destroyer firing laser beams at that small diplomatic vessel, I was primed for an equally epic panning first shot. That never happened. I can say that I was concerned from the get go, from the scrolling text that puts you in the story, but this would be a spoiler. I can only say that this exposition in yellow letters is the second worst since the one in episode III. Since this a spoiler-free review, I am forced to talk about this movie in general. Let's start. Visually the film is stunning. I watched it in HFR 3D and it was as sweet as your mama's a**. However, the 3D experience is – once again! – completely useless. Unless your name is Cameron, no director ever needs to promote a 3D version of his/her film!! So I suggest you go and see it in 2d, BUT – and this is important – go for the biggest screen possible. You will thank me later. And this is where it comes crumbling down. Besides the stunning visuals, true and seamless practical effects and colorful scenery, this is an empty film. The scriptwriter is from the original trilogy – Kasdan wrote episodes V and VI – so you would expect a stellar story. Something along the lines of TESB and not ROTJ, less fur, more substance. Surprises to be included also – mostly having to do with the family ties of the main characters. What we got was a rehash of the original one, albeit this is not 1977, we have seen this before and it's not going to blow our minds. Not anymore. We need something much stronger than that, something that is fresh, new, clever and above all F****ING ORIGINAL!!! Seriously Disney, you bought ILM only to make the same stories again and again??? No wonder some of the actors didn't want to play anymore in this new trilogy. This is not a NEW trilogy, it's the exact same story we've seen before – TWICE actually! – only with new actors. Even worse, they are given only a fraction of time to develop their character before they jump into an action scene, that makes no utter sense, precisely because we never got to be engaged with them. I never really gave a damn about Po, Fin, Rei or any other character in this film. F***, they even managed to ruin some of my favorite ones, like Chewie, C3-PO and Akbar!! This is the level of not-giving-a-turd-about-script that manages to destroy a franchise. Mercifully we were spared from another Jar-Jar (I feel dirty simply by typing that name) but this doesn't justify JJ's choice of making Chewie a walking carpet in this film – literally! The same old recipe doesn't work anymore in this brave new movie world. My only hope – a new hope! – is the last 2 minutes of this film. Suffice to say that for me, they make this whole shipwreck of a movie worth it (you might need to study some Jedi lore to actually grasp the meaning of these 2 minutes). I'll have to wait till episode VIII to see a truly epic Star Wars again. But then again, the middle episode V was – and still is – the best one. The force just hit the snooze button and is going to awake in the next episode. (For the original review please visit https://livingbesideme.wordpress.com/2015/12/26/star-wars-the-force- snoozes/)From the ashes of LucasFilms shall be woken, A light from the Disney shall spring; Awaken shall be Force that was forgotten; The Star Wars is back as it should be Watching Star Wars VII will definitely gives you the shivers! The movie manages to combine the new with old, paying a lot of respect to the legacy (New Hope) and prepares a new SW generation for the future. There's no ultimate bad and good guys here, there are gray zones and that's what makes the heroes so interesting. Yes sir, there are plot holes, but I guess most of them will be filled in the next episodes. As for now I am 100% emotionally satisfied, as J.J.Abrams delivered more drama that I was expecting. The music is the weakest installment of all, but still J.Williams delivered a magnificent space opera (go listen to 'Rey's Theme').Not for cynics Kind of sad to see the number of 1 stars out of 10 reviews.  Are you kidding me? I feel bad for anyone that bitter.  Out of every hundred movies made there are easily 90 that are worse.  It's a good lesson that history repeats itself with different twists.  Great effects.  Great action.  Good characters. Leaves you wondering next steps.  Saw the first when I was 7 in theaters.  I am going to chalk these negative reviews up to spoiled brat unemployed millenials with nothiñg better to do.  They are as a lot so entirely frustrated with their own personal failures that they can only derive happiness from tearing down others. Get a life.A little bit of a small disappointment I believe that I was a bit disappointed of this new follow up of Star Wars, not because it's that bad, compared to the latest (I, II, III), but because of the great response to the movie especially in here (imdb.com), which I'm using quite a lot, before choosing which movies to see in the cinema. Firstly, a lot of the scenes was taken directly from the old Star Wars movies (if you're Star Wars fans, you'll know which scenes that I'm thinking of). Secondly, the big bad villain who has been trained by a Jedi (the last skilled light sword and mind tricking master alive, that We know of), can't even win a light sword fight over a "common" Storm Trooper and a girl who haven't been trained at all. Lets remind ourselves, that he had killed all the other Jedi's that was trained by Luke Skywalker. Thirdly, Han Solo and Princess Leya, when he's ready for the travel to "save" their Son, it seems they are both getting ready for kissing each other, and suddenly he's hugging her in a very weird way instead. I must say this movie is worth watching from my point of view - BUT, I don't understand the score in IMDb. I know there's a lot of younger people giving points, but to see this movie reach as high in points as the old Star Wars movies (IV, V, VI), which were epic, for me screams out that something is wrong. As said before, this movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either - I know for sure, that if this Star Wars movie had been the first in a row of movies, I wouldn't have been as fascinated about Star Wars as I am, and I feel this movie is somehow taking advantage of the old movies. I hope the next movies in line will prove me wrong!Most overrated movie in history? What went wrong with this movie? Was it too much comedy? Or the countless plot holes and wtf moments I had while I was watching it? I really don't know. Were the first 10 minutes directed by the same guy, that did the rest of the movie? The movie had such a great introduction: dark, mysterious, violent. But it all went downhill from there... It's not only they took most of the story from Episode IV, there were so many scene that were just absurd and ludicrous. Han Solo popping out of nowhere, and the first thing he tells them is that "all the old stories were right". The whole scene felt awkward and forced (no pun intended) just to place it in the trailer. The first serious conversation Finn and Rey have is about her boyfriend... just horrible. Why does a stormtrooper soldier even ask this kind of question? I how did he turn from a trained killer to the Prince of Bel Air? When Kylo Ren took off his helmet I couldn't decide if this was Scary Movie 15 or Star Wars. He destroyed everything that made the Sith scary and fearful in 1 second.  There is one scene near the ending that is so incredibly bad it just makes you want to get up and leave the theater. It's a scene between Han Solo and Kylo Ren. This scene is a direct spit in the face to the bad-ass Han Solo we all know and love.The "Farce" awakens... *** May contain spoilers for who has not seen the movie or not been interested in Star Wars extended universe, books, games, etc. *** First of all I would like to congratulate J. J. Abrams for ruining the Star Wars Saga. This is a bad movie, a lousy script trying to duplicate the first Star Wars movie, episode IV, no depth, plot holes everywhere, and very bad acting. Adam Driver and John Boyega were both terrible. Boyega's character Finn was totally useless in every sense. Driver's Dark Jedi can only be called as a "Sith-Com", he reminded me of Rick Moranis' "Lord Dark Helmet" in Star Wars parody "Spaceballs". How can someone even think about about a lousy teenager Sith who destroys some panel in front of him when he gets angry about a failure and then returns calmly to say "Anything else?" Was that supposed to be funny? Can there be a Dark Jedi whose mastery about the force is so great that he can even paralyze his opponent in battle or stop a blaster rifle's energy shot in mid air for minutes, but cannot even win a light- saber duel with someone who has seen a light-saber for the first time in his life, that cannot even understand that it is a weapon? I am grateful that Darth Vader is dead and didn't see these happening. There were countless logical errors during the movie, especially in both opening and near the end, the bleeding injuries after being shot by blasters. Does Abrams think that blaster rifles shoot bullets? Hasn't anyone who has some logic didn't notice these kind of lousy errors? Only Daisy Ridley's acting was decent enough, but transforming her into a "Satele Shan" from Star Wars The Old Republic game trailers out of the blue and without any reason, with no training is non- sense. (And if we are to learn that she is Luke and Mara Jade's daughter in the next movie, it should have been mentioned in this one.) Almost every scene was predictable, especially the scene between the main villain and his father, which was a terrible scene, just put there to include a shocking tragedy, but unsuccessful. The final scene was supposed to be culminating, oh yes, the little girl finding her way to reach the long lost hero and reminds him of his duty by pointing out his ancestral weapon. At least duplicating Luke's search for Yoda in the Empire Strikes Back would be even better. In general, more than a film, this is some action filled scenes pasted one after other. And unfortunately just the presence of light-sabers or Millennium Falcon is not enough to call it a part of the Star Wars saga. The visual effects were good, but I personally think that the real success of the original trilogy was its minimalist atmosphere. J. J. Abrams shouldn't even be considered as a director, he clearly proves that he has no sense for cinema and knows nothing about "telling" a story. And it makes me think that the only thing he has seen about Star Wars may be Star Wars Rebels - The Animated Series. The level of seriousness is more or less alike.  The only good part is seeing Harrison Ford as Han Solo after all these years, but the way he was thrown into the story was truly amateurish, desperate to show him, but not knowing how to do. OK, you are trying to make a movie for kids but are your writers also elementary school kids? I rate 4 only because of Star Wars' sake.Review: Star Wars – The Force Awakens (2015) WARNING: POST CONTAINS SPOILERS After nearly a decade, the Star Wars franchise blasts back on to the big screen in J.J. Abrams' long-awaited episode seven. The film is set some thirty years after the death of the Emperor and follows the search for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who has gone into self-imposed exile after the failure of his attempt to resurrect the Jedi Order at the hands of his apprentice, now named Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who was seduced to the Dark Side of the Force by Snoke (Andy Serkis), the Supreme Leader of the First Order that arose in the aftermath of the galactic civil war and is attempting to restore the Galactic Empire. With the Senate of the New Republic refusing to acknowledge the threat of the First Order, Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) has gone back underground and is the General in command of the resistance within the First Order's territory and is supported in a deniable fashion by some elements of the New Republic. To some viewers dismay, the original trilogy cast are secondary to the plot and this is very much a 'passing of the torch' film, with the new characters taking centre stage as it focuses on Rey (Daisy Ridley), a scavenger on the planet Jakku, and Finn (John Boyega), a defecting Stormtrooper, who meet on Jakku after Finn helps resistance fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) escape from the Star Destroyer he was being held prisoner on, and how they all are swept up in the search for the last Jedi. As with all Star Wars films, the effects are stunning and the action fast passed and thrilling, but my prejudices against Abrams' story telling abilities remain very much intact as the plot is a rehash of episode four with Lawrence Kasdan's writing efforts seemingly limited to ensuring the original trilogy characters remain true to form. Of the original trilogy characters, it is Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who drives a lot of the action forward as we learn that Kylo Ren is, in fact, his and Leia's estranged son, Ben Solo. Because the plot is a reworking of episode four, we could see very early on that Solo was the Obi-Wan figure and that he would meet his end at the hands of Kylo Ren in the same way that Obi-Wan died at the hands of Darth Vader. Even so, his death is a genuinely shocking moment as, even though we all saw it coming, it was still a surprise to see that the writers and studio had the nerve to kill off such a popular character. There are a lot of plot holes and gaps in the storyline such as how Han lost the Millennium Falcon, how the First Order came about and why they're not using clone Stormtroopers who are programmed for obedience, and who Snoke is and how he came to lead the First Order. I know that there is a trilogy of novels being written by Chuck Wendig to bridge the gap between episodes six and seven, but there's no guarantee that all of the fans will read them which means the pressure is now on episode eight to deliver a lot of this back story. Having said all of that, the writing is very well done with well-rounded and likable characters, good action set pieces and an excellent lead in to episode eight in 2017. One of my biggest gripes with the writing is that it was stressed that this would be a new storyline for the Star Wars universe and that it would not have anything to do with the story lines in the extended universe novels, and yet it certainly borrows from both the Heir to the Empire and Fate of the Jedi series so much so that I have to wonder why they didn't just film those books. Even with all of the above mentioned flaws I'd still recommend going to see it, but, for me, this was a six out of ten movie that just about escapes being a 'meh' moment.If you are a Star Wars fan, you will be very Disappointed People asked, "how was the movie?" Well, my wife slept through some of it,and I stepped out to use my cell phone." It was incredibly boring and mediocre: episodes 1-6 were much better than this. Episode 3 blew episode 7 away. It's as though Disney put forth the least amount production effort in the movie after acquiring the franchise and is counting on the cult status of the franchise to drive ticket sales; unfortunately it appears to be working. If you have read other reviews that state this is a regurgitation, or reboot, of a previous episode; they are not wrong. This movie lacks any new story line for us to enjoy, and the new characters are weak and underdeveloped. I didn't care if any of the "good guys" lived, or died. Again, very disappointing. We can't recommend this movieHey! lets put up a bigger death star this time or a planet maybe This thread contains crucial spoilers please proceed with caution. I still cannot believe how senseless and low IQ people the dark side folks are. They have already lost 2 dark stars (twice the same way and the same star) and yet this time they have a huge death planet but still the weakest point of the weapon is on the surface and penetrable. What is the point. Well the Empire never learn from the past thats what it looks like. On the other hand Jedi training starts from Padavan class which the Jedi candidates are so young and juvenile pupils. How could it be possible for a fresh starter Jedi young woman to be a match for almost a master Sith lord. JJ Abrams let down again as he always does.Just Plain Fun!!! I gave this movie a 10. Loved it to be honest. Seen it 2 times already. The 2nd time you kind of pick up on things you may have missed the first time around. It is worth the watch if you ask me. If you have not seen the First 6 movies I would suggest you do to get a better understanding of the whole universe. I plan on seeing it again next year in January, then buying it when it is released!!! I thought there were also some pretty funny parts as well. Now I can't wait for the next episode to come out, I am sure it will be just as good!!!! So for the New Year take your whole family out for a treat and watch Star Wars together!!! Happy New Year!!!People Need To Lighten Up. It Wasn't Great, but it was Fun. I am old enough to have seen every Star Wars film in their original runs and have been a fan of the franchise from the beginning. Seems like everyone wants to be a professional movie critic these days. I read reviews where people just want to complain at a level that tells more about how unhappy they are rather than taking a movie for what it it. Then you have the movie studio shills writing ridiculously positive reviews that makes this film comparable to Citizen Cane. Finally you have the hard-core fans that will not complain about this film under any condition. My message is simple...Lighten Up. I took my 9 year old to see his first major Star Wars film in a theater for the first time that he will remember and spend as much time observing the movie from a child's perspective rather than a cynical adults that spends as much time looking for the flaws than enjoying the ride. My son cheered when the good guys prevailed, cried when Han Solo died and has spent the last several days speaking of the film.  As Yoda said: "Truly wonderful the mind of a child is."  Now from the cynical adults perspective: It wasn't perfect. This was certainly a "Passing of the torch" movie where you have to deal with the aging original cast while incorporating the new cast of characters. I knew this was going to be troublesome giving ample screen time to everyone. To be honest, the way Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford have aged, they can no longer carry a Star Wars and sell the sizzle like they used to. Father time has caught them. I didn't have much of a problem re-treading some of the original concepts, but the film certainly went too far. The new Death Star plot was weak. The film did not need another "Ultimate Weapon". The Villains were not particularly meaning. I would call them almost comical. You will have a hard time finding a kind word about Kylo Ren. My biggest disappointment was they made this weenie to be the offspring of Han Solo/Leia and of course the grandson of Anakin Skywalker. I would have preferred this character to have been a non-related Jedi recruit that went rogue rather than a descendant of Skywalker. Although the new 3 main actors were obviously cast by race, sex and national origin I must say I liked them and they had really good chemistry.  I am going to take the perspective that after ROTJ, the Sith and the Jedi were pretty much wiped out and were are not catching them at their prime. I am hoping the next film cleans up some of the plot shortcomings. For now, enjoy the ride.At least they did not "rape" Harrison Ford this time. All the way back home from IMAX I was wondering why this particular one seemed to be for me the only not-so-awesome episode from all the Star Wars" films. Every other one I simply love and hold dear like a part of my childish memories, but this one did not have even a small part of epicness we could see in the previous movies. No scene will be remembered as a classic, no actor will become a new generation movie hero - neither a villain The old faces from the original saga make this film good and it's not only a sentiment – they are now much better as actors (Mark Hamill's look at the end of the film is you just need to see that!). Unfortunately the young ones have much to learn and I am not only talking about the Jedi skills. My final rating is 7/10 and I sadly need to say I am simply disappointed as a Star Wars" fan. The character Rey, although as a mix of Keira Knightley and Natalie Portman, she's only a kid and it's hard to identify with the kids on the plan as they are very average in every aspect. On the other hand, Rey started better than young Anakin, so she still can show something better in next two episodes and I hope she will. Finn as a character was given a role of another Afro-American that needs to make a lot of wows" and he's overacting like the pilot in The Matrix: Reloaded", so I just confirmed my concerns I had after watching the trailers. Kylo Ren is not even a shadow of Darth Vader The soundtrack is nice, special effects are amazing (worth watching in 3D – especially for X-Wings, Ties and a Star Destroyer). I think J.J. Ambrams did more good with Star Trek" to give it a new life. I expected much more than improving a visual aspect. Maybe it's a Disney thing At least my wife loved it... And they didn't rape Harrison Ford this time! I suppose we should be grateful for this detail.nostalgic feeling I must have watch the star wars movies few hundred times. JJ stayed in a safe zone in the story line. it seems like copy cut paste of the episode 4 - 5 - 6 ı was hoping some original scenes and new vision to the franchise. What he did in star trek was great. but for star wars its to weak. Villain Kylo Ren needed more depth to it.. my opinion Disney is trying to reach out to new generation and create a new fan base.  Kylo Ren needed some serious dark side in him. I wish they got help from C.Nolan for that character. he would have made him a bad ass Jr.Sith lord. What C.Nolan dd with Joker character was amazing in Batman franchise. ıt really gave me a nostalgic feeling our expectations are high for this Saga. ı have to say Fin is great Daisy Ridley is a great choice for the role. for Kylo they needed somebody else casting department for kylo failed.Typical bland joyride - no depth I found myself really trying to like this movie...it was hard. Was it all bad? No, of course not. Most any bad movie has its virtues.  I don't even know if I'd call it bad, just...not good. *spoilers* Both of the new main characters basically had no past worth mentioning. Finn had the upbringing of an automaton, and Rey was stuck on a desert planet to scavenge by herself, with apparently no friends. Finn wants to leave. Rey doesn't. That's honest to God the only difference between the two characters as far as actual character is concerned - level of courage - which gets switched around as the movie progresses, making the two completely interchangeable.  Reactions to events in the movie are dry and unfeeling. *HUGE SPOILER* Let's not lose sight of the gravity of what the first order did in this movie. They are most likely authorities on the strength of their enemies. And according to them - They JUST BLEW UP THE REPUBLIC. THE CORE OF THE REPUBLIC, PROBABLY CORUSCANT ITSELF!!! Take the population of Alderaan and multiply it by at least 50 for that planet alone!!! And there were at least 5 planets destroyed! Was anyone affected? Did anyone react, beyond "They've just wiped out a whole solar system!" Almost saying "That bratty kid, look what he just did to those planets!" Hello!!! We're talking PROBABLY 50 TRILLION PEOPLE. You know how in Abrams's Star Trek, Vulcan gets destroyed, and the whole rest of the movie has the pain of Spock and the goal of justice for the Vulcans as the driving force of the movie? Right? You know how force sensitives could sense Alderaan's destruction? There was NOTHING. There are multiple other examples - these are just the big criticisms that underlay the fatal flaws of this movie as I see them. The characters are bland, the relationships don't feel real, and nobody cared about what they were doing. I couldn't feel anything in this movie. I wanted to like it, badly. I wanted Star Wars to be given new life, but I left this one numbed by the gaping vacuum I had just experienced. JJ. You can do better than this, don't be afraid of the new franchise. Don't be afraid to take risks, to crate a new equal chapter of this cultural icon. Don't hesitate to make us feel something, for fear of tampering with what we've all hailed as theatrical perfection.  Your other movies prove you've done this same formula, and far better than this. What happened???I can feel the hate swelling in you now! A review for the fans. The film is a masterpiece of escapism entertainment and so what if the template was borrowed in part from previous Star Wars movies (especially the original trilogy) – those movies worked! I'm not surprised at all with some of the hate filled reviews on here, I guess you can't please all of the people all of the time – only the vast majority of the developed world who can afford a ticket. Admittedly nostalgia levels were very high, but I felt as though they were warranted when I watched the finish article, as all boxes were ticked. *Potential very small spoiler* I particularly enjoyed the quite literal 'Force Awakening' scenes with the main force sensitive characters (not yet Jedi or Sith), who in some cases were literally fighting for their lives with zero training and a yet unknown midichlorian count. I'm looking forward to being able to share the experience with my 6 year old son one day soon, I'm sure he won't be dissecting the plot, drawing parallels with the originals and complaining about a "lack of vision". The torch as finally been passed to a new generation, well done JJ and company!Absolutely Amazing More than 10 years after the last Star Wars movie as released, the Force Awakens was well worth the wait. The First Order is now a threat, thirty years after the defeat of Emperor Palpatine. Luke Skywalker has disappeared, leaving behind only cryptic pieces of a map to trace where he is. The Resistance, led by General Leia Organa, struggles to fight the First Order while searching for Luke. On the far off desert planet of Jakku, resistance pilot Poe tries to obtain a piece of the map to Luke's location, however Stormtroopers invade and Poe is forced to leave the map with BB-8, his droid. A scavenger, Rey, finds BB-8 and is unassumingly drawn into an epic journey, where she will come face to face with the evil dark lord, Kylo Ren, the infamous Han Solo himself, and... the Force. With elements of the Old Movies thrown in, and some new twists on a classic story, The Force Awakens is brilliant. The CGI is not overdone and the overall tone stays true to the original Star Wars saga. I was absolutely blown away and beyond excited for the next instalment coming in 2017.What if it was a remake Imagine that if instead of the seventh episode it was a remake of the episode IV (the first one, to who don't know)? Disney would be destroyed, tons of people would cry: HERESY. And thats what I said to my kids when they asked me why it was never done a remake of the three ones. I said that it would be a heresy and would be a failure in all cases. Even if it would made it with excellence, the first ones would ever been better, because they were the first ones. Sou Disney choose to don't make a so called remake, but the episode VII has, obviously, the same history of the IV. The main line is the same, only the characters are changed e some parts are added but the history is the same. With more action and much more technical quality. And that's what made it a great Star Wars movie. it is a remake without being a remake and gives the tribute to the heroes of the first one movies. I enjoyed, my kids enjoyed so I think it is a great great movie and, I dare, the best Star Wars Movie I've seen.The force will be with us. ALWAYS! I am writing this review to clear the air about some of the things the haters are saying as well as to explain clearly reasons to love and be excited about this continuation of the franchise. I personally loved the movie overall but I can admit that at a couple of moments I felt an internal eye roll occur however neither of those moments was a deal breaker for me regarding the movie. First we wills start of with the haters. They complain that the plot is just like episode IV, or is it just like episode VI, they really can't decide...OK most of them say IV. Yes there is a superweapon (one of my eyerolls, I thought that the dark side would have moved on by now) (Just like IV) Yes a female character was captured and needed to be rescued (Just like IV, NOT! She practically rescues herself. Different story, way different actually)  Yes a band of X-Wing fighters led by an amazing pilot needing a team to deactivate the shields protecting the superweapon so they can fly into part of it and destroy it (just like Episode IV NOT! More like VI if anything) Yes a droid is carrying vital information that both sides want-a map that would help locate Luke Skywalker(Very similar to episode IV) Alright and that's about it... The rest of the story is more breath of fresh air.  Daisy Ridley as Rey is a different kind of hero than we have had before in Star Wars, very confident, resolute, a young woman, and STRONG with the force, albeit perhaps untrained? People are complaining because she seems TOO strong. However, no one knows exactly what her early childhood was like and was she a young padawan before her family abandoned her on Jakku? I think so. She's awesome, strong with the force and fun to watch, get used to it. AWESOME. John Boyega as Finn is interesting/disappointing/and comical at times. But disappointing as to his character in the film not his acting. We are disappointed in him when he first wants to run to the outer rim rather than fight with the resistance. However you are inspired by him when he picks up the lightsaber to try to defend Rey against Kylo Ren late in the film.  Kylo Ren is an OK villain. He would have been better if he would have kept his mask on more, but I guess they were trying to show us the conflict going on in him between light and dark. He could have had facial hair though, Adam Driver looks bad awesome in his interviews with a goatee. However when he murders a very close family member that all of us love so dearly, who are fans of the franchise, we do now have some sufficient reason to hate him. He receives further criticism from downers when he is bested by Rey in a lightsaber battle, however, downers have to remember he did take a shot from Chewbacca's crossbow, he is not a full power Sith or Dark Jedi, and he is trying to convert Rey over to his side rather to kill her, and finally Rey is obviously very talented and has received some training which will most likely become more apparent in the next film.  General Hux looks scary and convincing. I don't like Snoke's name but hey I am pretty sure he is really Darth Plagueis the Wise anyway and will seem much more menacing once we all realize that in later episodes. BB8 is cute, sassy, and funny.  Han and Chewie are great in their reprisals Leia we haven't seen enough of yet but seems like will play a significant part in other episodes Yeah so Luke only appears in one scene. Big. Freakin'. Deal. Haters. It's a good scene! And for all those that say the whole story copied episode IV, yeah I remember when at the end of episode IV a young force sensitive youth piloted the Millennium Falcon to distant planet to find a long lost Jedi Master and present him with his father's lightsaber and say daddy or uncle I am home! Oh wait. That did kind of happen when Luke went to find Yoda but it didn't happen until halfway through empire and Yoda wasn't his dad or uncle he wasn't even his great- uncle. This part of the story is different! Way different! We have a young talented Jedi now standing in front of the Jedi Master who will now come together to rebuild the New Jedi order and at the same time be forced to confront the strongest Dark Jedi or Sith of all time.  It will be EPIC! Good continuation! Yeah more superweapons isn't for everyone but I mean if you are going to strike fear across the galaxy you have to have something like it I guess...An almost perfect Star Wars film It is unfathomable how much hate and criticism this film has received. When the prequels had been completed back in 2005, people were complaining that it was nothing like the original trilogy and therefore it was complete garbage. Yes, I agree I was not a big fan of the prequels, but Revenge of the Sith is my third favorite Star Wars film. My number 2? The Force Awakens, and here is why. Yes, it is a rehash of A New Hope, but the way it does so is amazing and mind blowing. You can pick apart each and every detail and I would not care. This film was an epic rehash and I enjoyed every minute of it. The acting was superb from the original actors (minus Luke who stood their in silence.) Harrison Ford played the Han Solo I remember watching as a kid and Carrie Fisher led the Resistance as Leia Organa-Solo. Finn (Boyega) and Rey (Ridley) initially to me didn't have good chemistry, but when Han Solo came on screen that all changed. It seemed like a new Star Wars family for the new generation was created. The pacing was near perfection. The plot twist of the films main villain, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) was the son of Leia and Han was not much a surprise. What was the big surprise was his name. Ben. Named after the infamous Obi-Wan "Ben" Kenobi. The way this was introduced was heart breaking as Han had called his name to his son, you knew what was next. This is the reason I really hate but love Ren as a villain. He stabs his father with his saber and pushes him off the catwalk. He finished his transition to the dark side. He was like a mini Vader and the only thing that bothered me was his childishness but it was used for good comedy. All in all, The Force Awakens is the Star Wars film you have been looking for. And to the "fans" who hate the film, I think you're wagon hopping. You say you don't like it but HATE it. You aren't a Star Wars fan. I do not like the prequels but I admire them BECAUSE they are a Star Wars film.A fantastic film if you understand context and managed expectations I loved this movie, immensely. It was fantastic. Too many people let hype culture kill their experience or something else.. I didn't. I am a HUGE Star Wars fan, I've spent so much time with Star Wars throughout my life and this movie was a roller-coaster ride of emotions and fun. I am very excited for the upcoming releases, don't let the negative nancies ruin the movie for you. A movie can have flaws and still be fantastic, I don't understand why some people can't grasp that! Their was nostalgia, joy, laughter, sadness, tension, and even remorse. It was a plethora of emotion, with tons of nostalgia to show "hey we know the prequels were a letdown and we want to do this right." the setup for the next films had me thinking so deeply about this film, and that's a good thing! When Empire was out the movie ended on a huge cliffhanger, people had questions, were disappointed, and they let the fact of that ruin their experience. This movie does not tell you everything, or spell it out for you, and that's let some people have their experiences ruined. The score was fantastic, the cinematography epic, and the character development was very fun. Watch it now!Far and way the greatest film of 2015. Let's be honest, it wasn't even close. Star Wars The Force Awakens is a beautiful film. It's the Star Wars film that we've been waiting for for 30 years, the film that the prequels failed to deliver. It is full of gorgeous visuals, memorable characters, and genuinely funny lines but above all, it truly felt like how a Star Wars movie should feel. Wildly entertaining, at no point during the film did I feel removed from the action, or that I was waiting for the next scene to happen. The movie is very fast paced, with very few slow moments. That being said, the action flows together perfectly and somehow manages to never feel rushed. For me, by far the best part of The Force Awakens were the characters. And I don't mean Han, Luke, and Leia. While it was great to see the original three back in action, and Harrison Ford gave another brilliant performance as Han Solo, the ones that really stole the show were the new characters. The story centers around Rey, an independent, resourceful scavenger on the planet Jakku. Rey has clearly endured many hardships throughout her life and yet somehow, she remains hopeful about her future and maintains a strong optimistic attitude. As the movie progresses, we see Rey begin to discover her powers with the force and how to use them. But only towards the end of the film do we realize how powerful she truly is, and I am very excited to see what's in store for her in episodes 8 and 9. Part of what made Rey such a believable, effective character was the spectacular acting performance by Daisy Ridley. No other actor could have done a better job. The majority of the comic relief in this film comes from Finn, an ex storm trooper who encounters Rey in the desert after he crashes while trying to escape the First Order. It was fascinating to see a little inside the life of a storm trooper, something we never really saw in any of the previous films. Finn is equally as believable a character as Rey, and John Boyega's performance was spot on as well. Part of what made these two characters so great was the on screen chemistry between them, something that the prequels failed to deliver with Anakin and Padme.  As for Kylo Ren, aka Ben Solo, it was awesome to see such a complex character that has so many layers as the villain. We learn more about Kylo Ren's back story and personality in this one film than we do about Darth Vader in almost all of the original trilogy. The light saber temper tantrums, the side punching, the conversations with Darth Vader's helmet, Kylo Ren is the perfect balance of emotional kid and pure bad-ass. Star Wars The Force Awakens has brought back everything that I loved about the original Star Wars while at the same time, adding an element of mystery that did not exist in the originals. The movie is pure fun to watch and is so entertaining that I didn't notice any of the issues until my second viewing. If a massive grin didn't spread across your face when Han and Chewy burst through the doors of the millennium falcon, or if you didn't get goosebumps when Finn ignited Anakin's light saber for the first time, then you were never a TRUE Star Wars fan to begin with.  Facts and even more facts. You're welcome ; )Great Movie (For Star Wars and Sci-Fi Lovers) This is a very good movie, a fantastic work by JJ Abrams and his crew. This film is mainly focused to "reboot" the series and to create a new generation of fans as well as bringing back the many fans the franchise has. The film focuses on the new cast: Daisy Ridley as Rey, John Boyega as Finn and Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, as well as the newest droid in the series, BB-8. We see the return of our favorite characters as Han Solo, General Leia and Luke Skywalker. I have seen this movie at least 3 times, I liked it a lot and I totally recommend it to whoever that has not seen it (if that's your case). The special effects and CGI are great, not exaggerated as we saw in the prequels. It has a good story, many surprises and unexpected plot twists.  Star Wars fans will like to see Han and Chewbacca come back, they won't see Jar Jar Binks and they will like the combination of practical effects and CGI. To round things up, this movie is great, primarily for the Star Wars fans and Sci-Fi lovers.All of the best parts of the previous installments, with none of the cheese! 'STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS': Five Stars (Out of Five) The seventh installment in the immensely popular space opera film series; and the first chapter in over ten years. It takes place 30 years after the events of 'RETURN OF THE JEDI'; when the Galactic Empire has now become 'The First Order', and the rebel alliance has now become the 'Resistance'. The story deals with a First Order stormtrooper, named Finn, who's looking for redemption; after gaining possession of a map, to Luke Skywaler's whereabouts. The film was directed by J.J. Abrams; and it was written by Abrams, Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan (who also co-wrote 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK' and 'RETURN OF THE JEDI'). Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker all reprise their roles, from the original trilogy; and they're joined by newcomers Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver and Oscar Isaac. The series creator, George Lucas, returned as a creative consultant; and John Williams once again scored the music (as he did all six previous chapters, in the franchise). I think it's the most entertaining movie, I've seen, in 35 years! We first learn that Luke Skywalker (Hamill) has gone missing; and due to his absence, the ruthless First Order has gained power, and control, over the galaxy. Princess Leia Organa (Fisher) is now a general, of the Resistance, and she believes finding Luke is humanity's only hope. She sends her best X-wing fighter pilot, named Poe Dameron (Isaac), to the desert planet of Jakku; in order to locate a map, which can lead to her brother's whereabouts. On his mission Poe meets a stormtrooper, looking for redemption, named Finn (Boyega). Finn joins Poe in his adventure; he also later teams up with a scavenger, named Rey (Ridley), and a veteran war hero, named Han Solo (Ford). The film is definitely the best written, of the entire franchise; with clever, witty dialogue (for the first time, in the series). It also has the most humanity, and thoughtful drama (I cried multiple times). It's surreal seeing Han, Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, and other original cast members, on the big screen again (in a new movie); and I think it was justifiable asking Fisher and Hamill to lose weight, for their parts (it's necessary to the roles they're playing). The new characters are also extremely likable, and soon to be classic, as well. Ridley is a revelation, and I think she rivals Jennifer Lawrence; for one of the best performances of the year! Driver, Boyega and Isaac are all fantastic as well; and Ford is, once again, classic! The movie (without question) deserves several Oscar nominations; for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, acting and more. The approach Abrams takes, to the material, is exactly right (it's traditional, old fashioned filmmaking). The film is everything you could possibly expect (or want) from a 'STAR WARS' movie; it's funny, heartfelt, touching and action-packed. All of the best parts of the previous installments, with none of the cheese! It's at least the best in the series since 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK'! Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/149466777Better than the older fans want you to believe. (No Spoilers) J.J Abrams has no without doubt constructed and delivered the best Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi. Better yet, the best Star Wars film after Empire and A New Hope. Jedi isn't as definitely having good things in it, but without doubt planted the seed for what was to come in the Prequels. Ewoks anyone? Like I said though still a great film, but not Star Wars good.. Evidence of this is by the wonderful cast of familiar and new characters, particular stand outs are Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. The action was great, story while familiar still works, which worked wonders in the past. J.J borrowed the best, while adding his unique touch. As he did with Star Trek and Into Darkness. An example of this is, Terminator to T2: Judgement Day, are both similar and yet the details are different enough to stand on its on. Something like Terminator Genisys tried something so outlandishly different to where it doesn't even feel like a Terminator Movie. Which they complained about, but the opposite etc? It did a wonderful job bridging the gap of Jedi to a new story. Practical effects were 10/10. I think the older fans are but hurt that more people are exposed to a new generation. Remember Empire initially got a mixed reception and now it's regarded as the best film... TFA is far from perfect but a step in the right direction, as much as those trolls online want you to believe.An awoken Audience One day I woke and there it was: The Force Awakens. I had gone to sleep with my r2d2 1984 action figure only to find out that somebody stole it. I soon found out that the movie took my collectible item without asking. Looks like Kylo Ren is making a ham sandwich for this. BB-8 steals the show with all of the magnificent lines the droid has. Finn, a stormtrooper who realizes that being a stormtrooper is not what it seems joins forces with Po in order to make Kung Fu Panda 3. Rey is an orphan who finds out she has the force ( But who can her parents bee ??????). Overall, while people call this a remake of episode IV: A New Hope, I believe that it is a REMASTERED version which is way different. Personally, I like A Force Awakenes and hope one day I will get my figure back.best movie ever!! Can i just say that the movie blew me away? cringing, breathless, amazing and possibly the best star wars ever made! so many classic concepts were kept and the storyline blew my mind! one hour passed since i left the cinema and my head still feels like its comprehending and storing information!! the movie is spectacular. best movie ever on my list would be star wars episode 7....bless j.j Abrams. Being myself a star wars maniac and a gigantic fan of the franchise seeing this movie exhilarated me to the fullest degree i would ever thought my mind could possibly handle. I have waited years for the movie days and long months to watch it. Star Wars will forever keep its legacy!!The Force has Awakened! Delightful Film! This movie was excellent, If i were to choose one word that described this entire film for me, is that is was a delight.  A treat if i may. What an excellent and fun movie to watch and enjoy. I was never a big Star Trek fan, but when i saw the reboot JJA, did, i was really impressed, and thoroughly enjoyed his style of storytelling. Ever since the, he had been on the top of my list of directors to direct the next Star Wars film, if it were ever to be made. Few years later behold. JJA, was announced to be directing the next Star Wars Film!  Im really glad JJA took the helm of this much beloved franchise, I honestly don't think there is any other director, who could have taken this franchise and set the new tone and bar for the next installment, the way JJ did. MAJOR Props to everyone involved in making this film. Yes, i do agree that the plot is similar to the older traditional films, but its the "Star Wars" story! You will never get that confused with any other franchise. They way the characters (Old/New) are introduced are seamless and flow beautifully into the film. The craftsmanship of the props and effects are incredible along with the visuals. It was a nice blend between the two and it worked so perfectly. This movie really makes you feel like a kid again, and i had a blast!!!! This movie may disappoint some hardcore fans or movie critics, because you just cant please everyone, and people can be so nit picky and annoying despite all the HARD work put into making films in general. But, i understand the amount of hard work, time, and commitment that went into making this film and, IT DELIVERS the goods in 12 Par Secs, taking us on a new journey back into a Universe we once visited, and have come to love. It feels so good to be back! Edit 12/22: Watched it 4 times now. Opening Night, Opening Weekend, and Twice today (Once with my mom, and second with a friend). More than likely will be seeing two more times with other friends and family, but i love experiencing this movie with friends and family! With the Mom: She had forgotten about the old star wars film, and didn't remember them well, but she was on the edge of her seat the entire movie. She loved the film so much, she could not stop talking about. The first thing she says when we walk out the auditorium was "Wow, that a really movie. Thank you Son!" With the Friend: He had been a fan of the original trilogy as child like all of us, but never watched the prequels. Also he isn't big into scifi or marvel movies. He likes more drama and actor/actress driven type movies, like Wolf of Wall Street, Drive, The Departed. But i got him to come and see The Force Awakens, and he also thoroughly enjoyed it. He enjoyed seeing the Millennium Falcon back on the big screen, as well just seeing places that bring us back to the good ol trilogies.The best one yet I will probably be the only one, but I really do think that this movie is the best star wars movie yet. It had awesome acting and John Boyega and Harrison Ford really did their job. When the final battle between Finn and Kylo Ren began, I really was holding my hands up to my face with my mouth just open. Very nice unexpected plot twists, like the death of Han Solo (I F**KING WARNED YA). BB-8 was an awesome droid, being very cute and hilarious, but not overexadurated and trying-too-hard-to-make-us-laugh-y. It had some really small flaws though, like Rey once helping out and knowing more about the Millennium Falcon than freaking Han Solo or sometimes being too similar to the other movies, but other than that, a supreme movie and a great experience over all. 11/10 would watch it again.If u are A TRUE FAN u will love this....GRADE A Cause i'm sick and tired of a few people who are bashing this movie and the prequels i want to clear that anyone who is a true fan and loves the star wars universe loves all 6 movies the same and now he loves also the new addition to the series. Part 7 is exactly what u expect to see as the dark side comes back with new villains and heroes who fit great with the old stuff we used to know. Most of the original crew is back fitting beautiful with the new crew , the cgi are great and the movie as a whole is A MASTERPIECE. Now for all the devoted fans who are connected to the story and characters u will be moved and never get enough. No spoilers at all so go watch it for the 2nd and third time in a theater and then also get the DVD // blu ray plus whatever u like from the STAR WARS memorabilia. Next year we get the first star wars spin off called rogue one and i can't wait. PS. A word of advise to the haters....bashing this movie u only make us love STAR WARS MORE AND MORE......AND MORE SO STOP ALREADY AND GO TROLLING SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE BOARDS CAUSE ALL STAR WARS MOVIES ARE GREAT.....NOT JUST FIRST THREE. CRYSTAL LAKE CLEAR.The franchise lives on! No spoilers here. Thanks to the new actors and characters totally loved it. Saw it twice in theaters. Might go again. First off... Oscar Isaac is my hero. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and the not as popular Adam Driver (more later) all brought a new spark that got me pumped for two more movies! Adam Driver was awesome. I don't care what anyone says he did great and his character is sick. The more I reflect the more I liked him and what he brings to the table (something Isaac and Boyega can't). I have talked to a lot of die hard fans about what they thought as an end result and everyone liked it. Sure we all have parts we wish went how we would have wanted them but they did a good job making something that people would like to see again and again. The biggest part of this review I think should be what Daisy Ridley brought to the table. Lately there have been lots of female action heroes in movies and she is definitely one of the up and comers. I just like that women would actually say I like that character which is new to the Star Wars movie franchise. Great move on their part! Definitely go see this movie!The third best film in the saga after Episodes IV and V....................... (MAJOR SPOILERS) Well here it is. After an incredible marketing campaign with some brilliant trailers, we have the seventh Star Wars film without the shadow of George Lucas hovering over it. JJ Abrams really has brought a superb sequel to the screen, pleasing old fans like myself while still making sure that the new trilogy will be its own thing by the time Colin Trevorrow brings us Episode IX in 2019. At the time of writing this, critics love it and if I'm perfectly honest, so did I and is without a doubt the third best in the entire saga. So far I have watched it twice in IMAX on successive days and loved it each time. However, a lot of fans are making out its just a rehash of Episode IV with some of Episode V mixed in. Now this is true to a certain extent but it does NOT ruin what has been put up there on screen as it sets up far too many things for Episodes VIII and IX and by the end, it becomes its own film AND story entirely. So many good things about this film and its just so great to have an incredible cast of actors and characters (both old and new) become a 'family' together on screen again just like the original trilogy, but was completely lacking from the prequels. The welcome return of Harrison Ford (back on form here as the Han Solo we knew and loved in Episodes IV and V), Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill (Although I was over the moon to see him, I was disappointed with his 2 minute voiceless cameo at the end), Peter Mayhew and Anthony Daniels. Then we have the 'new generation' of actors taking the saga forward and the casting was just incredible as they each give it their all. The star of the new cast is without a doubt Daisy Ridley who plays Rey. Considering this is her first film, she is very beautiful (that smile) and is incredibly likable. Her lightsaber fight towards the end with Kylo Ren was just thrilling, and once a familiar piece of music kicks in, its classic Star Wars. John Boyega is also excellent as Finn and again such a likable character. Oscar Isaac was a revelation in this as the incredibly heroic Poe Dameron. Adam Driver playing the sagas best villain since Darth Vader in the form of Kylo Ren. He was more 'frightening' with the mask on and I just LOVED his voice!!! I have to mention BB-8 who is just a brilliant successor to R2D2 and C3PO with some spot on comedy moments in the film. Rounding off the cast we have Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma. She is underused but we know she will be back for Episode VIII. Domnhall Gleeson as the 'Peter Cushing-esque' General Hux. Andy Serkis on form with motion capture again as Lord Snoke. And again another likable character in the form of Lupita Nyong'o' Maz Kanata who seems to know more than she lets on. What we didn't get with the prequels in the form of love for the characters, is the complete opposite here and that is what will makes us love this trilogy even more. Lots of people slating John Williams score which I find just unbelievable to be honest. I am listening to it now while writing this and although its not his best score of the saga it is still superb and would you rather he had NOT come back???????? Ridiculous!!!! I think also that the score got 'drowned out' during the movie due to the amount of battles, sound effects, etc in the movie which is why people didn't seem to 'recognize' any new themes. But the score IS a Star Wars score and I just LOVE the theme he has come up with for Rey. Beautiful theme and classic John Williams. The ONLY downside with the whole film for me was the aftermath of Hans death at the hands of Kylo Ren, who we find out is actually Han and Leias son who has turned to the dark side during Luke training him. He has destroyed a new Jedi order and hence why Luke has vanished during the film. Hans death was perfectly done, but the rest of the characters just seemed just to 'get on with it' after it had happened. Even Chewbacca and Leia just walked past each other after the Millennium Falcon returned to the rebel base!!?? There were a couple of moments of 'sadness' from Leia and Chewbacca but it just wasn't enough after seeing the sagas most popular character killed in such a horrible way and even then at the hands of his own son who we find out that his real name is actually Ben. Anyway, I just cannot wait for Episode VIII now that JJ Abrams has set up so many things in this film. I read recently that Episode VIII will be completely different from any Star Wars film that has been before and that is exactly the RIGHT thing to do. I think its safe to say that Daisy Ridley and John Boyega will be front and centre in Episode VIII, but PLEASE give Mark Hamill lots more to do in Episode VIII and Don't kill him off!!! I would also like to see a Force ghost in the form of a popular little green fella. I also hope we get plenty more of Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron as well who will be a great replacement for Han Solo. All in all and just like Jurassic World, this sequel has given fans like me reason to believe in Star Wars again while at the same time is going to bring us something new. A brilliant sequel and it was exactly what I hoped for. Roll on Episode VIII!!!!A Huge Return to the Star Wars Film Franchise Let me just say that "Fans" who are nitpicking this film for being unoriginal are missing the idea of this film's intention. It was made to please the Star Wars fans, it has everything in it that makes a good Star Wars movie, you have the Space Battles, Lightsaber Fights, Action-Packed Adventure, and Mysterious Mythology that the Original Trilogy had. That being said, I thought the film was really good and very well directed by J.J Abrams. The new trio in this film are very well casted and well acted by John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, and Oscar Issac. The reprisal of the Original Trilogy cast was very thoughtful and they definitely looked like they were having a ball. Kylo Ren is an interesting new villain, Adam Driver does a good job of playing a villain who is trying his very best to be like Darth Vader and I really am wondering where it is going to go for this character in the next two films of this trilogy. The Visual Effects were good, the Sound Effects were good, The Comedy was hilarious, the Score by the Legendary John Williams was Phenomenal and the effort made by the Crew to have as many practical effects as possible was well done. The plot is pretty good, but like the other fans, I do have some questions about where they are going with this, I don't know, maybe we'll see in Episode VIII. I honestly think they are paying a lot of homage to the original trilogy so they can set the foundation and focus on the future films. Overall, I am give this a perfect 10 out of 10 because it gives us almost everything we have been asking for that the Prequels failed to give us, it also gives us something that I can say in one word, Fun. So what are you waiting for, go see it now.An infinite journey that continues to blow away every expectations What a huge comeback!! Just one of the best action movies I've ever seen! Combining drama with epic Star-Wars fighting scenes, Force Awakens truly surprised me. I was apprehensive that the big headlights given to this movie would end up disappointing me with a normal one but I couldn't be more wrong! Brilliant idea of George Lucas to get the same plot as in the movies before, since 1977, mixing up with a fresh new batch that reinvigorated the saga itself. Overall, Force Awakens shows off some snazzy visual effects combined with a compelling story and great characters. It won't disappoint. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!JJ Abrams is brilliant: Same formula as the original 3 JJ Abrams is brilliant: Same formula as the original 3 You have a scavenger who discovers, in this case she is not just a scavenger, but has the force and a mission. They rebooted the Sith, with what are now called the first order. All the classic characters are back. Harrison Ford, Chewey, Princess Lea, Luke. The film is warm, and leaves you fully satisfied in every respect. It should win the academy award for best movie of the year. It had the biggest premier of any movie in history of cinema. This is the best star wars out of all the 7 movies so far, and any true Star Wars fan will tell you this. JJ Abrams who created the show Lost, is brilliant at leaving mystery behind every movie or show.Great movie This is a great movie and well worth your time! My only quibbles (which are quite minor) would be "another super-weapon" and some derivative plot points. Perhaps the pacing is a bit fast in a few places. The acting is far superior to the six other movies (especially Ford, Ridley and Boyega) and the ending is superb. Of course the action and battle scenes are fantastic. I plan to see this movie again at last a few times and I want to see it in 2-D instead of the IMAX 3-D to see what might be different. I'm anxious to learn who/what Snoke is and how he corrupted the Jedi Academy. J.J. Abrams has certainly captured the feel of the movies and is moving them forward interestingly. Looking forward to more!Abrams Delivers!!!!! SPOILERS!!!  First off, PLEASE DO NOT PAY ATTENTION to the negative comments, poor reviews, and frustration out there from people who claim to be Star Wars fans. If anybody is upset about this film, does not like the film, or has negative things to say about the film, they are not truly a Star Wars fan and are probably upset that Jar Jar Binks was not in the movie.  OK, now I can share my thoughts. Hands-down the greatest movie I have ever seen in the theater. I say that based on the kid who at four years old saw Empire strikes back and return of the Jedi and I was absolutely floored it was so amazing. Abrams has brought me back to my childhood, has brought Star Wars and the galaxy back to the vintage rusty futuristic garbage scenes &amp; of course the original cast.  What I love so much about this movie is that Abrams opens up so many cans of worms that you could literally take this movie in so many different directions it is so exciting and at the same time it is really toiling with my inner spirit. I fear in my conflict that I may turn to the Darkside. However I will not because Jesus is my true light, but that discussion can be tabled for a different time. Is Rey Luke Skywalker's daughter? Is Poe wedge Antilles kid? Is Finn Lando's kid? We already know that Kylo Ren is Hans Solo's son. Is Snoke Darth Plageuis? Did Han Solo kill himself or did Kylo Ren kill his father? So many more questions can be addressed, that we will ask those later.  I love Rey. She is bold, strong, confident, and a warrior at heart. I love the cast, I love the storyline and I'm gonna leave one thing for you fans that I really wish Abrams would've written in the script. Let me know if you would've liked to hear this line at the end of the movie when Rey was holding Luke Skywalker's light saber at him; "Here You Go Dad". Peace out / 10 out of 10 / cannot wait for episode eight!10 Stars a Perfect homage to the source material This is one of the best movies of the year! It stays true to the source material while paying homage to the prequels as well. It s not stop action from scene to scene. Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher do a great job reprising the roles that made them legends. Lets hear it for the new boys as well. Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac come alive on the screen and I cant wait to see what they do next.  The story picked up from where thy left off so brilliantly that I'm still shaking with excitement. It was a perfect blind of old romance and new romance. The dialog was not as cheeses as I originally thought, and the over all performance of even the extras surprised me. The CGI was not a eye sore at all. JJ (Director) did an amazing job using where he needed it and mostly sticking to set and props.  From choreographed light saber battles to space dog fights with X- wings and Tie fighters, if you are a fan of the original series and even the prequel, or if this is your first starwars movie, you will not be disappointed.Best A So today I went to the premiere of the long awaited new star wars Episode 7.  Here is a fast and short opinion: The movie blows really blows.  Here is the more detailed opinion. The movie has no star wars feeling. None. No deep dialogs about the force and almost no background about what happened in the period between episode 6 and this one.  The dialogs between Ray and Finn sound like two modern age teenagers talking (first real dialogue between them, Finn asks Ray if she has a boyfriend). Horrible. Then there is the First Order (successors of The Empire) the bad guys. Their leader commander is the Sith wimp Kylo Ren who answers to a extremely bad CGI drawn Supreme leader (really?) about whom the audience doesn't get any information at all.  Kylo Ren is an insecure teenager with anger issues. His character destroys the sleek mysterious Sith presentation of the both prequel as the original trilogy. This is really a bad thing.  The main weapon of the First order is a death star on steroids. But the way the weapon works is taken straight out of Star Trek. This is a criminal offense.  Han Solo and Chewbacca appeared in the movie absolutely out of nowhere. It's like Abrams and Disney were desperate to throw them in there just for nostalgia.  Once again out of nowhere Ray figures out she has Jedi powers. The first time it happens is when Luke Skywalker's (who as been explained shortly decided abandon everyone and live in isolation in a place unknown) light- saber suddenly possesses the ability to show her where it's located in exactly the same way like bracelet of Anubis showed to Evelyn it's location in the movie Mummy returns. Also the audience figures out later on that non-Jedi's also can fight with light-sabers when Finn ( not a Jedi ) fight the wimpy Sith Kylo Ren. It's like who needs Jedi's, give a light-saber to a regular Joe and he will fight almost as good as a Jedi who had years of training.This film rewards repeated viewings just like the original trilogy did Having seen it for the third time (on opening weekend), I can now safely say it is easily on par with the first three films. Every viewing reveals new details, subtle nuance and more charm. Where this movie excels, though, is it is funnier than any Star Wars episode before it, as well as having superior acting to ANY of the first 6. Perhaps most importantly, though, The Force Awakens has that intangible magic that makes every viewing more wonderful than the last ---a quality that only an extremely few films possess (such as the OT Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws), thus making TFA a true film for the ages.  I can't wait to watch it again. And again. And again...Star Wars is back! I am seeing a lot of people nitpick this movie pretty bad, and I know that is gonna happen with any movie this big, and any Star Wars movie for that matter, but people really need to calm down a little bit. First of all, I recognize that this movie has some flaws, but every movie does and anyone who expected a perfect movie is completely unrealistic, and really only has themselves to blame for being let down. The OT are, in my opinion, some of the greatest films ever made but they have some issues too people all movies do!!! That being said this is such a great movie. Its amazing to be back in this world, especially since it feels like Star Wars again. Some people are complaining that the movie didn't flesh things out enough, and I think that for certain things that is correct, but Lucasfilm is leaving reveals for other films and they are smartly thinking ahead instead of blowing everything in the first film. Others are claiming that the movie is a rehash of A New Hope, when really it is mainly just homage with a couple points that I agree were too similar, and I think this movie is based on the idea that history repeats itself. Every single person that I know that has seen this movie, which is pretty much everybody that I know, absolutely loved it even if they had a couple minor issues, and there is no doubt to me that this is an amazing start to this new trilogy! The original cast was all brought back in a perfect way, the new characters are great and I already love them, and I cannot wait to see what comes next. The force awakens is no doubt the most difficult task ever handed to a filmmaker, and JJ Abrams did an amazing job bringing Star Wars back. It is a complete triumph, and it deserves all the money that it is going to make. I cannot wait for episode 8!!Predictable very predictable I'll be nice and give this movie a "2" rating. The movie was highly predictable, it had little if any originality. That Disney screwed over the EU for this is beyond me other than for capitalistic reasons of course. I refuse to even call this real Star Wars as it has very little to do with Star Wars, let it simply be a remake for that is what it really is - So I will simply not call it a Star Wars movie other than in name only. I saw the movie with a large portion of nostalgia with some hope on the side. It feels just like when Bethesda ruined the Fallout franchise by rewriting the canon of that franchise. So now have Disney done to Star Wars but just like with Fallout franchise I do not have to recognize this Disney Star Wars. In my as well as most ADULT fans's opinion, Star Wars is now a dead franchise or at the very least dying...Let it die.A total disaster, I want my money back! This is awful, I could not believe my eyes, I left the cinema sad, frustrated and disappointed. Such a bad plot (in fact a copy of old episodes), no story, no star wars feeling, where is star wars in this movie?  I will have to watch the old episodes asap to refresh my star wars love.  Advice to all star wars fans: don't even bother if you didn't watch this episode, you won't miss anything. It is not a sequel, this is blatant remake and badly done, boring and predictable. A few good words which someone else said: "unimaginative, cheap, no fantasy, lacked vision" If you want to watch star wars watch the old episodes, they are all good, this one is really bad.This was not worth ruining the ending for Return of The Jedi. I'm going extra hard on this Movie. Just after watching it I'm extra confused, I wish I could go through scenes and see if it's as bad as I feel. I don't see what you guys are talking about when you say it's great, I did feel it had good parts. But overall it makes no sense. Kylo Ren is a Crying bitch and acts like a spoiled brat, he doesn't even look like Han or Leia and yet he's supposed to be their son. They killed Han Solo in the most random pointless way imaginable. I just don't get how any star wars fan could forgive this? Seriously our new darth vader is so pathetic he can't even handle two brats that never even held a lightsaber? Do I say that it has no good Points? No, it's more well written then the prequels but it doesn't feel like Star Wars. It feels like a star wars fan film with a massive budget and the original actors in it. They said Kylo Ren were supposed to have ended Luke Skywalkers new jedi order but can't handle two kids that never even held a saber? Was Luke's jedi order full of pussies? It makes no sense at all... And who the hell is snuke? Why should we care for him? Why do you guys feel this Movie is so great, I'm simply not feeling it. This Movie was NOT Worth ruining the ending in Return of the Jedi in order to make.Disappointing to say the least I honestly CANNOT believe that this movie has a current rating of 8.6 That is absolutely ridiculous. I created an account to review this movie because I felt so strongly about how trashy it was. 1. How can anyone get over the fact that J.J. Abrams completely threw away Star Wars rules? I guess the rules don't apply to Rey and she can just use the force when she pleases with no training whatsoever. I'm so sick of Hollywood ruining story lines and characters just to be politically "correct." Rey is not superwoman. She is an (emotional) teenage girl who was handed things and skills because she struggled early on. Such a predictable and annoying character. 2. Finn is useless. He is only there for comic relief which is unnecessary. He seems out of place in the movie and has no depth to him whatsoever. He doesn't want to be a storm trooper? Cool. Why? "Because it's the right thing to do." What made him think this way? That might have made the story more interesting. Instead we're given a bland sidekick with dry humor. 3. Oh, the humor. Disney how you baby us. Did we really need such childish humor throughout the movie? For example, when Rey is bound by Kylo Ren, she (somehow, with no training) uses the force to compel the storm trooper standing guard. The guard repeats what she says and undoes her constraints and beings to walk away. Ren quickly adds "and you will drop your weapon." The trooper replies "And I will drop my weapon." What???? Was that needed. If he had just dropped his weapon that would have been fine but instead Disney had to dumb it down for us. 4. Kylo Ren is the absolute worst villain I have ever had the displeasure of encountering. People who are saying he is conflicted are so daft. He is poorly written and the most bratty bad guy ever. He throws a literal temper tantrum when things don't go his way. He worships Vader, his dead grandfather, for no reason at all. He says that he is pulled by the light (the light side doesn't pull you, only the dark does) but this is not a constant battle. He easily overcomes it and moves back to throwing temper tantrums. He wears a mask for, again, no reason at all. To all who are saying Hans death was so emotional and dramatic, WHAT? How could you not see that coming? Kylo was never conflicted, you knew he was going to kill his father from the moment the scene began. 5. I know Harrison Ford said he would only do the movie if his character died, but he looked like he wanted to die the whole time. Hans is this awesome, strong, witty, intelligent man. The Hans we saw looked tired and bored. Nothing against Harrison Ford, I'm sure he was given little to work with. Freaking Rey knew his ship better than he did for, again, no reason at all. 6. Hans and Leia's relationship was so awkward and a total let down. We have been rooting for them for 30 years now and this is what we were given?? Two adults who seem uncomfortable with each other and who refer to their son as "our son" and that's it. Also, Leia barely cries when Hans dies. So disappointing. 7. Lastly, (well, I could write 100 pages on my disappointment, but I've written too much already) like everyone has said, this is a replica of A New Hope. No originality whatsoever. The graphics were good and the plot could have been interesting had they introduced Mark Hamill sooner. I can't say many more positive things about this movie. I am so sad and disappointed in this movie and J.J Abrams. A complete letdown. Also, whoever is REALLY reviewing this so positively...why? How can you be so stupid? I hope the ratings go down so this film lands where it deserves- in the trash.They took my money Again fooled by Hollywood. After seeing an IMDb rating of 8.2 i decided that i had to contribute and get this score to a reasonable ratting. This movie is so bad i cant really be stuffed dissecting it in length. Another female who doesn't need a man, a leading actor who isn't a man, a villain who feels and a story line that is uninspired. This movie is a variation on the first movie. Person stuck on a distant planet, is a person of great abilities, goes into space, there's a death star and a man in a mask. My rant This whole feminine hero thing is getting boring. I would rather watch ja ja than this again. Skeptical about the next ones.Easily the worst Star Wars film yet. A real insult to intelligence. I will offer my thoughts about the new Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer. This new trailer, by the way, again got me to think about how bad of a film Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) is. I began watching videos and reading articles that criticize and pick apart this film, and I'll later post some of these videos on my blog. I've known from the beginning that it's not a good film, but I now realize that The Force Awakens is truly the worst Star Wars film so far. I really enjoyed watching and reading the negative things that people have to say about it. Here are a few reasons why it's so bad:  It is pretty much rip-off of Star Wars (1977). In addition, it is a much worse film than Star Wars. Why should I watch an inferior version of a film that already exists? I'd rather watch the 1977 original. And, not surprisingly, I haven't seen The Force Awakens since that one time in December of 2015.   The new characters (Kylo Ren, Rey, Finn and others) are not interesting or appealing. They're pretty much inferior copies of old characters like Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader. These new characters are just more proof that screen writers in Hollywood can no longer write believable human characters.   The Starkiller Base makes no sense. How could the First Order create a weapon that's several times bigger than the Death Star? Where did they get the time or the resources for this? In addition, the laws of physics don't apply to this thing. Is The Force Awakens more of a fantasy or more of a science-fiction film? The Starkiller Base is a result of poor screenplay writing.   So, The Force Awakens offers nothing new when it comes to plot and characters. It also offers nothing new when it comes to fashion or technology. Almost everything in The Force Awakens is something that we've seen in Star Wars films by George Lucas.   In short, The Force Awakens is a cash grab. It's not original. It's not art. It doesn't feel epic like the other Star Wars films. It's just a corporate product that was made to play it safe, to appeal to "fans", and to earn as much money as possible. It's just mind-numbing.  Well, there you have it. There are many more reasons why The Force Awakens is such a bad film. It's even worse than the Star Trek films that J. J. Abrams directed. The latest trailer does make Star Wars: The Last Jedi look somewhat promising. Rian Johnson probably made a much better film than The Force Awakens. But I won't be seeing it in a theater because The Force Awakens left such a bad taste. I'll be boycotting The Last Jedi just like I boycotted Rogue One (2016). What can I say? Thanks to The Force Awakens, the prequel trilogy that George Lucas directed doesn't seem so bad now. At least the prequels have some originality. Even that romance that was played out by Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman doesn't seem so bad now. By the way, I once read that Portman strives to keep a good image as an actress by not appearing in trashy movies. That's admirable, I thought, especially when compared to other Hollywood actresses. But, as it turns out, according to a gossip website, even she appeared in at least one movie without every item of clothing on her. I haven't seen Hotel Chevalier (2007), which is what that amusing cartoon that I posted earlier about, but I have seen The Darjeeling Limited (2007). I've seen it so long ago that I can't remember what happened in it, but I did include it on my list of the ten best movies of 2007. So, The Force Awakens is truly awful. But I'll mention that there's another film that's even more painful to watch. It's Casual Sex? from 1988. I'll admit that I like watching Hollywood films from the 1980s. Even the bad films from that decade don't seem so bad when compared to many modern films. So, what can go wrong? But Casual Sex? is so dull that it took me about a month to finish watching it. Sometimes, I watched it several seconds at a time. It felt like a chore. It's very dull. It stars Lea Thompson and Victoria Jackson, but there's nothing original about this film, and nothing interesting happens in it. If you'd like to get tortured, watch this film.A Disgrace to Humanity! A Disgrace to Humanity! Only for the Immature Mind. Garbage! Insult to Intelligence! This is Not a movie. It is childish nonsense. Pure Crap. Updated - July 2, 2017 This is a sad excuse for a movie. Go see the original 1977 and Empyire. Acting is crap. The music is crap. The plot is copied from the original. The comic is crap. The force? Where? Kylo Ren, as a villain, as an actor, costume, actions, crap. Leia, Han Solo - crap. Luke? crap. Fin and Po - crap. BBwhatever8 - crap. Chubacka - good. Rey - character, actor, costume, supergirl - crap. Where was the great music. Where was the great acting? The original had James earl jones, OB1, Peter Cushing. Even Luke and Leia. Han Solo always sucked, his character was always a dirtbag. Harrison Ford is way overrated. I have read all reviews and continue to read. It is my personal social experiment. I saw the move first time a couple of months ago. The crap is confirmed. Sad to say this movie and the love that it receives also confirms that the deception will continue. What's the story with the 10 star reviews? Non-objective nonsense! Saying it's great does not make it great. It just confirms that you are a liar! July 2, 2017 – Update to early review:  I am not a huge Star Wars fan. I am a fan of art. I do not think the original, 1977, movie was great. I thought it was a good movie, B rating. It should have been better. The acting on the most part were subpar. Han Harrison Ford Solo is garbage, I never thought he was a good actor, he just fell into the parts. William Kirk Shatner is much better. Luke was OK, not great. Lea was also only OK. What was great was Vader's look and the voice "James Earl Jones" and his dialogue. OB1 was good, better than Luke and Lea, but still not great. Peter Cushing, was great, but he was only in it for 3 minutes. I think what made the original work was the good story, the music, characters and the visuals. I did not enjoy the jokes. Comedy should be left to comedy movies, not sci-fi, or horror. Empire was almost as good as the first. Return pretty much sucked. No OB1, no Peter Cushing, and we had a bunch of puppets running around. So that was a C movie. But at least the story continued. The prequels succeeded because of the story. They were all C movies. Now we have, the Force Awakens. Admit it, it is a rip off of the original. You can make any excuse you want. The best is if you've never seen the original, and just want to sit and watch some wild scenes and never think about it again, you'll have a good time while you're watching it. But, some of us like stories that make sense. Especially ones that continue from prior episodes. That's where we have a major problem. I don't know or remember every aspect of what happened before, but at least it should make basic sense. Force Awakens does not. I have been reading and studying the IMDb reviews for the Force Awakens as a social experiment. I'd like to know how the thinking of my fellow humans think of this mess to how our society is right now. Can you see what's happened? We in the First World, are the ones that have. And when we want something else, we just buy it. If you're heavy, instead of exercising and watching what you eat, you get a surgery. If you're getting old, plastic surgery. If your tits are too small, then no problem, put it on the card and enlarge them. If you smell like crap, buy some expensive perfume. Got the point?  Force Awakens, is a lie. Most movies are. But there's something beyond that. Beyond the money that the studios want to raise. It's a hypocrisy! Movies are a form of education, of propaganda. Rather than teaching us something of value, to think for ourselves, this movie just gives us more candy and cake. Don't worry. If you have enough money or a credit card you too can have that surgery!Little substance Felt rushed, little plot, too many things crammed in. The villains felt extremely weak and underdeveloped/not inspired.  It gets one star for Han and Chewy's adventures the 4 seconds of Luke Skywalker we get, and that is about it.  The New Order just plain sucks. Supreme Leader Snoke and Kylo Ren?! Complete freakin' jokes compared to Darth Vader and Darth Sidious. The Emperor needs to come back, that is the only thing that can save this mess of a beginning to the sequel trilogy. The expanded universe was much better that this crap and ultimately ripped off some of its ideas anyway.Confused *****Warning Spoilers ahead***** So Rey beats Kylo but needs lukes help, who has lost to Kylo and his knights and ran away like a huge baby, to beat Kylo again?!?!?!? Seems like a better idea would be to bring Chewey have him shoot kylo again and just finish the job without searching around for old washed up scared useless Jedi who is now 3 and zip versus the dark side. Lost in ep 5 to Vader was beaten in ep 6 and obviously got his butt handed to him post ep 6. I guess maybe she thinks if she brings Luke to fight Ben and Gollum Ben might switch back cause he feels so bad for the loser like his father did?? Pretty much sums up what I saw. JJ Abrahms just put Star Wars into the DVD category for me.A Star Wars void of character and depth is merely a giant ad for toys. This movie has about as many (or more) plot holes and inconsistencies as some of the worst B-movies of the Eighties. Nothing makes sense, nothing feels designed to have some meaning or to build drama, instead everything that happens is like a loose succession of trivialities: Protagonists stumble upon each other as if the whole galaxy was small like a village. Protagonists don't seem to be able to express any real human emotions, apart from violent outbursts like 8 year olds, or shallow friendships. Nothing feels real. Protagonists turn into friends or enemies without real character development. It's like when you watch 8 year olds narrate stories while they play with their SW toys. Movie plot has the exact same emotional depth as 8 year olds playing with toys, I am not kidding. Don't expect to hear a new compelling music score, you won't find any. Also don't expect to see new creatures or planets that stimulate your imagination, creature design is just a rehash of what we are used to, NOTHING new is explored, no new planets or sceneries. (you just get the obligatory desert and ice planet, etc... I thought we had a whole galaxy to explore??? Can you believe how shallow the character design is? Apparently there exists an Asian looking gang in this universe whose name is KanjiKlub-Gang. You can't make this stuff up. It's EXACTLY what an 8 year old would choose as name. Also there is a childish understanding of astronomy, like in one scene having multiple planets just a few thousand miles apart from each other. (the old trilogy had much more scientific accuracy, at least they didn't make such glaring mistakes) This movie feels like a giant jedi mind trick. It's a TRAP!Spoiler-less review I want to write a quick spoiler-less review for those who still haven't seen the movie. In summary, eh. This movie is perfectly average, if it were a color, it would be beige. It's very predictable and filled with clichés, perfect for mass market appeal. If you're a star-wars fan because it brings back memories of your child hood, then you'll love this movie, because it's just a re-hashed episode 4. If you love star-wars because it's always pushing the boundaries and trying new things, give it a miss.  You probably wont feel like your being robbed of your money, but you won't be missing out if you wait for DVD release, I certainly won't be paying good money to see any more star-wars in the cinema again.Star Wars in name only. ***SPOILER ALERT!!!*** I just came back from watching this movie and must confess it made me feel empty inside. I'm a big Star Wars fan (of the original trilogy), but didn't feel like The Force Awakens added anything to the mythology or universe of George Lucas' creation. If anything, the Star Wars universe of J.J.Abrams feels a lot smaller, a lot less interesting and with a lot less in it. It also feels a lot less believable. Had it not come with the Star Wars tag attached, I think most people would wonder what the point of the entire ordeal was. First of all, there's not much of a story. We don't get much information about the previous 30 years (since Return of the Jedi), or any explanation of who the bad guys are, where they come from and why the ending of Return of the Jedi apparently counts for nothing. There's still an Empire of sorts (now called The First Order), ruled by someone we learn nothing about, but who is a badly conceived CGI character that looks like the kind of CGI characters we saw in movies 10 years ago (LOTR, Harry Potter, I am Legend etc). His Sith apprentice is a completely non-intimidating weakling, whose path to the Dark Side seems as plausible as that of prequel Anakin Skywalker: Puberty-related anger issues or whatever. He also manages to get his ass kicked by a girl who learns the Force by closing her eyes for 2 seconds. Because reasons.  As for the plot of the movie, it's a dumbed down rehash of A New Hope. While the new Death Star is like 500 times bigger than the old Death Star (because it's now a whole planet - BIGGER IS BETTER!), the new "Empire" feels smaller and less menacing. While The Empire of the old trilogy was loosely modeled on The Roman Empire and Pax Romana (peace through conquest and assimilation), the cartoonish evil of The First Order seems mainly based on a desire to destroy for the sake of destruction. We don't get to know why they hate The Republic so or what their objectives and motivations are. They are simply evil for the sake of evil. As for The Republic, we see it for about 5 seconds when the bad guys destroys it with their Death Star on steroids. And to add insult to injury, not only does the solar flare gun of the Starkiller Base (yes, that's the name) not obey the laws of physics (the solar beam splits up to hit multiple planets at once), but the entire Republic is apparently visible from planet Takodana - because our heroes, who are there, look to the exploding planets on the sky and yells "it's the Republic". It's so utterly ridiculous, you'll just have to see it to believe it.  All in all, there seems to be very little respect for the laws of the Star Wars universe, while simultaneously a lot of sucking up to fans by superficially referencing the original trilogy whenever possible. One of the most important rules of good storytelling, is an internally consistent world. Once you set up rules for how things work, and make sure your story never strays beyond those rules, the audience will generally be willing to accept all kinds of bizarre and impossible world constructions. But the moment you break those rules, it ruins the suspension of disbelief. You no longer believe in the story.  This happened to me all the time throughout watching The Force Awakens. At no point did I feel immersed in the story. At no point did I forget that I was sitting in the theater, watching a movie. It remained distant to me and I was unable to lose myself in the world or the story; A world that never really feels like the world of Star Wars, and a story that is as unengaging as it is devoid of substance.Script is retarded Really terrible! I could not get myself to believe the story at all. All the previous series were philosophically simple yet deep. This one was just simple without the depth. Simple to a degree of being retarded and so awfully predictable. Felt bad afterward for wasting more than 2 hours of my life. The characters are OK, the props are actually good. Whoever wrote the script has a total lack of imagination. In this supper vast galactic universe there were endless possibilities to make this movie interesting. There is absolutely nothing new to the story. Its all just a repetition with new special effects. However, I must acknowledge the marketing plan behind this release. Incredible marketing achievement!The Force Awakens? Put us asleep. So many errors. So much disrespect for the original story. As a 55 year old father of four I was ecstatic that finally I would be able to share with my teenagers the wonderment of the Star Wars saga. Imagine my disgust watching this total betrayal of the original. Too much glitz and explosions and not enough plot. We waited for 2 hours and 2 minutes only to have the long awaited Luke Skywalker appear in the last four minutes of the film with nothing to say. I would have just assumed to be mugged behind the theater, to take my $80.00, than to sit for that long watching this boring movie. It hurt that there was no respect for the spirituality of the force. It was insulting that the movie seemed to be more concerned with being racially and politically correct for this day and time than to put real actors in place as leading protagonist. One year from now no one will be able to tell you names of the actors that starred as protagonist and antagonist, such was the failure of this poor script. In the end I returned home from the theater disappointed. The only thing my 13 year-old son had to say was "Dad, can we put on the DVD of the 1977 Star Wars?" We did with homemade popcorn.Lost 50 IQ points watching this. I've spent most of my working day reading people's reviews and now i decided to make my own first ever review. The fact that i am taking time to register and post this shows how utterly horrible this movie is. THIS MOVIE IS FOR 13 YEAR OLD KIDS, to lure them in the franchise and scoop the money from all kinds of toys and stuff. People posted all kids of mind numbing problems like story loop holes, inconsistency, terrible acting,etc. All of this is true..ill just go over few things that made me vomit in the cinema. The terrible wimpy villain that looks like an emo kid from some crappy manga (literally). The seemingly vital but totally useless black man? A wonder woman? The "political correctness" alone makes this move terrible. Its forced and unnecessary, totally out of lore for star wars universe. Acting by this kid Boyega.. worst i've ever seen. Instant jedi master by this yolo girl and most of all.. THEY ALL FORGOT ABOUT JEDIS IN 30 YEARS TIME!!! HAHAHA really? It takes Han Solo to convince them that the LEGENDS of Jedis are in fact, REAL! As it has passed a 1000 years or something? Another crappy death star, another boring droid...etc To top this there is a 2 minute lightsaber duel which was pathetic at best. I could go on for hours.. End scene Luke is standing on some cliff staring at the ocean, doing what? craping in a bowl like some hermit from asterix? I am calling all of you true fans out there DO NOT BUY TICKETS FOR SECOND AND THIRD MOVIE! I wouldn't be surprised if JJ Abrams hired personal bodyguards after this move.. AN INSULT TO MY INTELLIGENCE!Go sit at the prequels table, Force Awakens This was a paint by numbers movie. Take the 1977 film and color it anyway you want, JJ Abrams. When the Star Wars name is slapped on a movie, you spend a lot of money, make a lot of money, that's how it works. Big hype, positive reviews, I got caught up in the excitement, wow, look at the special effects in the trailer, lots of things flying around and shooting! Paid my $9.00. Watched a totally uninspired piece of garbage. Should have let Jodorowsky do it. There is no Heart in this film. Geez louise, these characters were bland, no character development whatsoever. Just believe whatever it is this girl can do, she just can, OK. Yeah, I don't know why she was collecting garbage and eating weird add-water bread when she knows everything about everything and is the ultimate jedi. And Han Solo's kid, Kylo Ren? What a turd. If he was so badass he would have instantly sensed the weakness in Finn and killed him then and there. And what was up with that big holographic freak Snoke? Snoke? Stupid name. Was he supposed to be scary? Everything has to be taken for granted. Things just happen with no explanation or connection. Where was Poe? Oh yeah, I uh, was OK after all. Surprise, buddy! Captain Phasma? What is this, Mr. Roboto? No, domo arigato.JJ Abrams shall never be forgiven Worst Star Wars movie. After so many years the engineers still failed learning the importance of a backup system? Both sides are using rusty fighters built several decades before? The Force has become so cheap and Rey could beat Ben in no seconds? If so why she is looking for Luke? The old Jedis were so dumb they need more than 10 years of training to play a mind trick or handle a light sabre! YOU KILLED CAPTAIN HAN SOLO? Every character is so shallow that I didn't feel anything. I personally felt worse and worse as it came to an end.At least it cant get any worse than this. This film was an absolute embarrassment to the Star Wars franchise. I grew up loving Star Wars more than just about anything and I thought this movie couldn't be that bad, considering it is part of the saga. I had low expectations, and even then, I am still disappointed in what I saw. I don't know how this movie is allowed to have STAR WARS in its title. First off: terrible scripting. Almost none of the characters delivered performances that related to the first six movies. I felt like I was watching an Avengers sequel with bad slapstick humor throughout and horrible modernized speech. Secondly: ZERO character development. Just about every character had no background whatsoever, and some characters felt added in for no apparent reason. Third: Bad casting. Usually movies have characters who deliver performances that feel right. Not in this movie. Other than the 2 main characters and the returning heroes, not one actor felt like a Star Wars character. Again, it felt more like Avengers or some other, modernized, Disneyfied movie. However, even the characters who fit their roles were dumbed down with the poor script written for this garbage. Lastly: Strong story is absent; plot is dull and predictable; climactic moments feel very anti-climactic. A travesty when compared to the traditionally strong story telling of the former Star Wars films. DO NOT get your hopes up. Like I said, I had low expectations and was still upset with this film. If a true Star Wars fan you are, disappointed you will be.Highly disappointed. I was expecting a lot more. Wasn't expecting something perfect, nor feeling the same way I felt with the original trilogy. But THIS has gone too far: if they only intended to sell lots of silly ball-robots, they could have warned us. The plot, childish and a total remake of the IV movie. The acting mediocre. Kylo Ren and Finn are maybe the two worst characters... although Leia is close enough. One point out of ten is maybe too low, I know: if this had been a completely different movie, the scoring would have been better, sure. But I have got two reasons for voting this low: first, my expectations, utterly betrayed. Secondly, with the characters coming from the old trilogy, the plot, all the feelings people had... it is difficult filming something this bad. And JJ... I have no words... no words: my first review ever in IMDb thanks to you. It's 3:50 a.m. and I go to bed in a very sad mood.Abrams doesn't understand how Star Wars works for women/girls JJ Abrams has been widely reported as saying that Star Wars was 'for boys' and something they shared with their dads. He has since tried to apologise for this statement and say that wasn't what he meant to say but after seeing this movie the fact that he doesn't understand female characters or how they work in this universe is blatantly obvious. Let's start with the latest Fanboy crush Rey. Let me start by saying I thought Daisy Ridley did a good job with the material she had so this is in no way a comment on her as a performer. It's just that the character is god-awful. Rey is instantly (and I do mean instantly) good at everything. Disney try and make us have sympathy for her because she is waiting for a family that abandoned her and she doesn't have enough food. Well she's rather fit for someone on meager rations. She can speak droid and wookie she can fly the Falcon (which has been sitting in the desert for years and flies fine btw)and she can use the force to jedi mind trick people into doing what she wants and to move items. It took Luke 3 movies to do that. Now I know at this point a whole bunch of fanboys will be saying it's because she was probably trained when she was younger and just forgot, she's Luke's daughter obi-wan's daughter blah blah blah. It doesn't matter it's just not plausible and it makes her character very 1 dimensional. If you compare her to other iconic Sci-Fi heroines like Ripley, Sarah Connor they had to struggle, they worked hard and they weren't ashamed to ask for or accept help. We went on the journey with them as they learned, in this case we do not. Phasma was supposed to be the other main female character but aside from killing a few civilians (oh yay) and bossing Fin around that's all she does (and again I don't care what happens in the next movie cos this one is awful). The minute she has a gun pulled on her she caves and does exactly what she's told. Leia never caved in when she was captured but this woman waves the white flag in about 20 seconds. OK now let's get to Leia. Again this is not a comment on the abilities of Carrie Fisher, I really like her and was so looking forward to seeing her in this movie. Again JJ Abrams has no idea. In an interview he said Leia isn't a Jedi in this horrible alternate reality (surely that's what it is) because she had other more important things to do. So I guess when Yoda told Luke to pass on what he had learned he must have meant to anyone other than his sister. Obi-Wan in the prequels and the clone wars cartoons very clearly is a Jedi that commands and army. Leia was always a smart woman why couldn't she do the same? In the EU books it takes her a while to complete her training but she does it and becomes Jedi Solo. Leia is portrayed as an older woman who has had all of her family relationships break down. Her husband and brother left her and her son is now gone. It's like her only point in the series now was to give birth to the new bad guy. Couldn't we have a non-skywalker bad guy just once? I read a comment in one of the reviews on here that the reason Chewie was the only one upset that Han died is because he was the only one close to him. Really??? the mother of his child wasn't close to him??? What utter BS. And now the Han/Leia relationship. It was one of the corner stones of the trilogy and they just destroyed it. Again it has no point other than providing us with a new bad guy. I say another review that said no one wanted to see an older couple in love, but I really did. I thought it would give those characters the gravitas they deserved. Han's death would have had much more impact then if they had continued to share the struggle for 30 years like the do in the books. As a little girl I never felt Star Wars wasn't for me. I never felt shut out. I loved Leia. I loved her with Han. It wasn't an issue for me. This movie casts women as either superheroes or redundant shells of their former selves. Like life just stops for all these characters after about 40. It's also just turned Star Wars into a series about dysfunctional relationships, which I can get on any TV drama/soap opera. So disappointing. Hollywood needs to be more realistic with their female role models.Don't waste your money on this trash.....!Boycott this movie! Well where do we start with this review?... I guess with my first initial thoughts of WTF! This movie is awful, dreadful, and pretty bad to boot. Its like the original star wars was reminiscing about its past while sat on a park bench with a bottle of wine in a paper bag... This movie has nothing of the star wars spirit, in fact it wouldn't have been surprising if Micky mouse was the new bad guy... In some ways this is entirely true... So lets call this movie out for what it is... Its just a weak ass money making machine, serving its corporate task masters, playing on the dedication from fans of the original series. The only acceptable part of this movie was seeing solo and chewbacca back together. I initially wanted to add a spoiler,but then thought it wouldn't be fair to people who may actually go out and spend their had earned cash on it... save your money, get some friends together to buy it on DVD and watch it together, trust me you will never want to watch it again..The Farce Awakens Firstly, I don't think this is a bad movie: it's an entertaining enough way to spend two hours: but it's a terrible Star Wars movie, hence the one star. Since most of what I think has been said at length and many times in other reviews I'll just add a few things which haven't been said so much. There were a few good opportunities to introduce some original locations: the place where Luke is, the planet where Maz Kanata lives and the place where the rebels are, but instead the just look like earth, my girlfriend even mistook Luke's planet for earth. Quick comparison: Darth Vadar vs Kylo Ren. Name; Darth Vadar sounds subconsciously sinister because it sounds like 'Dark Invader'. Kylo Ren sounds oriental. Costume: Vadar; Fantastically original, sure the buttons on the front are cheesy now, but amazing costume at the time. Kylo Ren; Recycled Darth Vadar, same dish, but with a slightly different sauce. When things go wrong: Vadar; dispassionately murders someone. Kylo Ren; throws a temper tantrum. Reason for suit and voice: Vadar; was horribly disfigured in a light saber duel. Kylo Ren; wants to be like his granddad, cause who'd like to be like dad when your dad's Han Solo? Under the mask: Vadar; kept in suspense as the story develops over three movies. Kylo Ren; some ugly young guy whose appearance would make me wonder about Leia's fidelity if I were Han.Unoriginal Ideas Repackaged in PC with "STAR WARS" Label Attached to Milk the Franchise There are plenty of YouTubers who have exposed this movie as being a low-quality rip off of many other great movies which won't be mentioned for the sake of avoiding spoilers. This movie is unoriginal and terrible compared to the original Star Wars trilogy. I would even rather watch The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith than this garbage. This movie is just a remake of older movies which were much better, coupled with a nauseating dose of political correctness to appease social justice warriors and their various special interest groups. Political correctness is no substitute for original thinking and new ideas. The media industry just repackaged ideas from other movies which were older and better in political correctness, slapped a "STAR WARS" label on the product, and are now hoping to milk the STAR WARS franchise for money while they ride it into the ground. I'd give this 0/10 if that was possible. This movie is a disgrace to the "STAR WARS" name.Very funny I think TFA was very funny. So funny that the whole film became a joke. But seriously, JJ Abrams failed miserably. How the character development of Han solo from ep 4-6 was totally ignored really strucked me and after his death that leia hugged Rey (almost a stranger) instead of chewie is just..... a disgrace. And rey being a mary sue is just so annoying. Finn had a lot of potential but they ruined it. Why did he laugh after killing dozens of stormtroopers with the fighter?? He left because his best friend (also a stormtrooper) died and he was shocked. And he didn't want to kill the villagers of course. Just sooo unrealistic. And rey closing her eyes for 10 minutes while fighting with kylo was just hilarious.
More marshmallow than Martian! The crew of an American base on Mars are forced to make an emergency departure leaving one crew-member behind presumed dead. But he is alive! Can the stranded astronaut find a way of communicating his plight to those on Earth and survive while he awaits rescue?  A fairly standard 'castaway' plot but one which offers many dramatic possibilities. Unfortunately few of these are realised in this pedestrian movie which fails to generate any significant dramatic tension. This is partly because the characterisation is thin but also because the challenges the stranded astronaut faces seem to be so easily overcome. Starvation? Grow potatoes. Punctured space-helmet? Sticky tape. Mars rover vehicle lacking power? Wire up a few solar cells. Communications equipment destroyed? Motor over to a handy Mars lander. We never sense that the 'Martian' (Matt Damon) is in a desperate, mind- and body-sapping struggle against the odds (conveniently he is a botanist). Damon effectively portrays the 'Martian' as a likable guy but the problem is how to fill the two hours of the movie that remain after he is stranded? When a character is alone and unable to communicate it needs something exceptional to keep us glued to the screen. Maybe what's going on back home will do it. Not really because the cast of characters there are verging on cardboard cut-outs. The returning crew? Likewise. And the script is written on the assumption that the audience is a little dumb, e.g. A: It will be 500 Sols (Martian days) before we can rescue him. B: But his food will run out in 300 sols. C: So he'll die before we get there. Indeed! And so may we.  The movie has some good FX and the Martian landscape looks convincing. But there's nothing exceptional here to compensate for the lack of an effectively told story. In essence this is an American feel-good fantasy film, celebrating ideals of technical omnipotence, racial harmony, gender equality and international collaboration (with those cool Chinese guys and gals). If only it were so. No wonder the credits rolled to the tune of The O' Jays singing 'Love Train'. School-kids will probably join in! But, to quote Sam Goldwyn, 'Include me out!' (Viewed at the Odeon, Warrington, 06 October 2015)This movie is really NOT good! Here's why. It's so frustrating when so many people like and praise a movie that really doesn't deserve it. The Martian is such a movie. I had such high hopes for it after all the hype, and after reading reviews by smart critics I usually agree with, but it was such a disappointment. Here's why:  Plausibility. Just like Gravity, there are so many non-sensical depictions of the physics of space travel, it makes my head hurt, and I'm not even a physicist. The characters and their actions are pretty implausible too, starting with Damon's chipper attitude about being left alone on a planet 100 million miles from Earth, but certainly not ending there. After realizing he is alone and will be for so long that he will run out of food, he gets the brilliant idea to try to grow his own, which we are supposed to take as a mark of his plucky brilliance. But he's a botanist! What would a botanist be doing on a space mission *except* studying how things grow? And then when an accident causes all his potato plants to die, the brains at NASA (who can't believe he figured a way to grow potatoes in the first place) instantly conclude (and tell us) that since the accident froze all the bacteria in the soil, he won't be able to grow any more. Why not? He still has potatoes to eat, and he still, presumably, shits occasionally, so he has all the ingredients he used the first time. Ugh! My brain hurts!  Writing. The script seems written more by market researchers than a screenwriter. Corny little one-liners ("My balls are frozen!") appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience, and the relentlessly happy tone makes being stranded on Mars seem like a big party, complete with disco music (literally). And the dialog!! There's a moment when Jeff Daniels, the head of NASA (whom it is hard to imagine has ever ever taken a science class or piloted anything) talks to the heads of the Chinese Space agency who offer (presumedly--we only hear his end of the conversation) to lend one of their ships to the rescue effort. He says, "Mmm Hmm. Okay. I see. Thank you." (That's what a discussion about loaning spacecraft between two space agencies sounds like.) Then he hangs up the phone, clenches his fists, and says, "Yes!" It's like Homer Simpson finding out there is still one donut left. That someone wrote that line is astounding. That the director and actor saw fit to actually shoot it is bewildering. That it survived the editing process and made it into the final cut--well, there should be an investigation.  Pacing. It's a movie about being stranded on Mars for months and months. Why does it feel like a comedy by Woody Allen or Edgar Wright? There is never a pause, never a prolonged quiet moment that might begin to capture something of the unbelievable space and loneliness this movie is supposed to be about. Instead, it is a constant rapid fire of dialog and action. Even the scenes where he is communicating with Earth via text happens faster than I usually get with my iPhone and 4G. (NASA technicians mention, at one point, that there is a 25 minute delay between all communications, but the filmmakers hope we forget this two minutes later when all the subsequent conversations happen instantly). Then there is the rest of the crew and their additional unplanned two years of extra time stuck in the spaceship, going all the way BACK to Mars to pick up what they left there. If I have to run back home to get something I forgot, the trip always seems infuriatingly long. But not these cheery space travelers! Another two years in space! No problem! And it takes only two minutes of screen time. Piece of cake!  AGH! What a frustrating experience. If you want a sugar-coated popcorn movie that will make you think that if being on stranded on Mars isn't really so bad, why complain about our petty little problems here on Earth? then this movie might be for you. It does for being stranded in space what The Shawshank Redemption does for being in prison. It tries to tell us that it's really not THAT bad after all. It's such a lie, and such a disappointment, all the more so because there are so many serious issues and exciting psychological and scientific aspects about space that could have been explored here.Expected more I am a bit of nerd of this kind of realistic science fiction movies and therefore I had high expectations of this movie. I regret to say I was disappointed. The movie tells the story of how the main character struggles to survive on Mars and how the space agencies work to get them back. But I was missing the emotions, the human touch. The main character never displays any signs of loneliness, despair or fear. He is more like "oh, looks like I'm stuck on Mars, let's grow potatoes". He makes a one- off reference to his parents in an electronic communication, but nowhere in the movie is it made clear what his main drive is to want to return to Earth. It appears as nothing ties him there. Maybe the directors wanted to avoid the cliché of the eight months pregnant and terminally ill wife eagerly awaiting her husband's return from a dangerous mission, but even a cliché had been better than nothing. His character is also too flat. The only character trait that is highlighted slightly in the movie is that he may be a bit too smug about himself. Nothing else to make me identify or sympathize with him. To be honest, I couldn't have cared less if he had not survived. The Mars landscape is beautifully rendered en very credible with dust clouds and all. This is the main attraction of the movie. The main problem that there is nothing novel about this movie. There have been better movies for every aspect of the film: Human aspect/psychology of being marooned in a strange place: Cast Away did it so much better; set in space: Matt Damon's role in Interstellar was more credible than his performance here. Space action scenes: Gravity had me on the edge of my seat Ground control scenes: Apollo 13 already set the standard In summary, the movie is a beautiful, but hollow shell.Not a Ridley Scott Classic I can't really believe that I just finished watching a Ridley Scott science fiction movie and feeling this low, this one never felt like anywhere close to any of his classics. This is just nothing but a typical Hollywood s***. Matt did a poor performance as a character who is caught in a life and death situation. He is not scared or emotional but instead he keeps throwing Hollywood typical punch dialogues on your face like an Avenger hero when you are expecting Science. A make-up artist or a sound engineer from the set of "Big bang theory" would have written better science script and dialogues. For me there are plenty of "WTF" or "Seriously?" moments in this movie and I wonder what happened to one of the favorite directors of all time. Also repetitive high five/triumph scenes where we don't feel anything. To brief: Drag, bad drama, insensitive emotional scenes, poor acting, very less science, predictable and not at all funny punch dialogues! Just YIFY it, don't buy!Utter piece of trash Boy, I haven't hated a movie this much in a long time. I actually just joined IMDb (I have been a long term viewer) in order to vent this out of my system, and to express my amazement that this terrible, vapid, cliché movie won a Golden Globe and is nominated for the Oscar best movie of the year. What the heck is going on? Are Aliens sucking the brain matter out of us little by little so that we actually think this tripe is not only good, but great?  A script a high schooler could have written, bad acting, terrible dialogue, one dimensional characters you don't care about, bad disco music, overly politically correct casting, mistakes in basic "science", stupid hap-hap-happy ending where everyone in the world (literally) is jumping, smiling and hugging each other, I could go on and on. This movie was so bad we actually kept watching it, like the morbid curiosity of looking at an auto accident.  My favorite line of the movie was when Jeff Daniels said that the Matt Damon character would be fine with his supplies "as long as nothing goes wrong". I looked at my husband and said sarcastically "Gee, I wonder if something is going to go wrong", and wouldn't you know it, in the very next scene it does.  We have sworn off any future Ridley Scott movies, for good. He is obviously in cahoots with the Aliens sucking out all our brain matter.Shallow, empty I was waiting for this movie for a few weeks and was greatly disappointed when I finally watched it. It doesn't matter if the number of potatoes to survive is accurate, if you are using toxic rocket fuel to make water, you do not feel lonely and isolated, and you are not worried about oxygen - you are just having fun - isolated for 300-500 days without anyone or anything else around - the guy seems pretty comfortable and not worried. Impossible to connect with characters. Too many stereotypes. Blatant sales and marketing, actor and story picks for the sake of selling more tickets. I hope I will save my money and time, next movie like this comes out.Were my expectations too high? I wish I liked this movie more like a lot of moviegoers who are giving it good to even great reviews, but I left the theater with a bitter taste in my mouth I had to write this review to reconcile my feelings. Imagine a movie that takes from the glory of Gravity, Cast Away and Apollo 13 which also tries to be as hilarious and groovy as Guardians of The Galaxy at times but fails? You've got The Martian. The first 1/3 of the movie was quite engaging: An astronaut on Mars expedition team gets left behind after a huge storm because he was assumed dead. But he was alive and we watch him try and utilize every cell of his brains and science savvy to survive until help comes. But once he gets out of initial danger things get all too predictable and over-wrought. Couple of annoyances: 141 mins. About 30 mins too long for the storyline. There were too many mentions of Disco music the commander of the mission left behind to ill effect, unconvincing supporting characters on the Earth who seem to be just reciting a script, and some characters the movie shouldn't have had whatsoever (such as Kristen Wiig).  Did Matt Damon do a good job ? I thought so until they showed a body double that didn't even resemble him and from there nothing he did was believable unfortunately. Had Damon actually lost weight without using a body double, I might have gotten more into the movie. But then again, he is no Christian Bale. So I wasn't expecting it but a little weight loss would have made him more convincing.  A few good acting jobs came from Michael Pena and Benedict Wong whose characters added to the storytelling instead of subtracting it in the midst of too many unnecessary characters reciting an already weak script.A movie written by frat-boys I don't usually like to give movie reviews - but it was a hot weekend and I figured maybe I'd venture out and see what the culture had to offer. So just how bad was "The Martian?" So bad that after an hour I realized I would rather be back in the sweltering 97 degree heat than sitting in an air conditioned theater listening to anymore inane dialog (lines like "F**k you Mars!" and "I'm going to science the S**T out of it!") In fact it would appear that a prerequisite for going into the space program is at least six months of doing stand up. (BAD stand up.) Why does everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) in the movie sound like one of those guys on "The Big Bang Theory?" Snarky and idiotic and always cracking wise. Also: Why did every character, while typing, READ what he's typing out loud? Has anyone ever done this EVER? And what was with all the expository dialog, (the whole script was expository as far as I'm concerned) Throughout the movie Matt Damon talks into a video camera, making a diary and yet he only says things that everyone who would potentially WATCH the video would of course already know, things like: "Oh yeah, did I tell you? I'm a botanist." It's clear he was attempting to speak directly to the viewer and NOT the imaginary audience in the movie itself. This is the laziest kind of writing there is. They don't know how to deliver plot anymore except to dump bowling balls of ham fisted information in your lap; telling you things you've already figured out in the most obvious way possible. That meant that there was absolutely ZERO tension. It was like reading an instruction manual for a microwave oven. "How do I grow potatoes? Oh look there's some poo." (cue the laugh track) And Ridley Scott's direction was as slack as an industrial film. False stakes, false resolutions, false falseness. Now,I know I only managed to make it through the first hour or so; maybe it got really good after that, but I was starting to feel my brain cells beginning to atrophy so it was from a sense of self- preservation that I skedaddled out of there when I did. (And don't get me started on the disco songs and requisite jokes about 'bad musical taste.' It was just more target-market reconstituted nostalgia-bait.) If there is a more unoriginal, un-involving, unbelievable waste of time out there, I haven't seen it. So of course: Line up the Oscars!Matt, you're not making this easy. This tedious family adventure film is the latest contribution to the popular and well established 'Where Are We Rescuing Matt H. Damon From This Week?' genre. I like Matt H. Damon, I really do. But he's been making it very difficult recently, and this 2+ hour marathon just doesn't help. Damon plays an astronaut accidentally marooned on Mars by a storm that literally could not happen because Mars lacks the necessary atmospheric conditions, where he must somehow survive with nothing but an unlimited supply of electricity, an unlimited supply of water, an entirely self- sufficient artificial habitat, half a dozen spare space suits, multiple land vehicles and probes (all in perfect working order), food supplies intended for half a dozen people, and a large quantity of magical potato seedlings that grow to maturity in just a few days despite a complete absence of soil nutrients. Since the first act establishes that Damon is so well set up he doesn't actually need rescuing, Ridley Scott fabricates a second act 'emergency' in a vain attempt to raise tension (it doesn't). Damon keeps in contact with Earth via a magical transmission technology that provides full HD streaming with no latency whatsoever, allowing him to have real time conversations with NASA headquarters, where everyone does and says whatever they want because there is no chain of command even though it's ostensibly run by Jeff Daniels (played by Jeff Daniels). His fellow astronauts remain hovering above Mars, beaming their own HD stream to NASA by the use of a magical camera that automatically homes in on Damon regardless of where he is on the planet. NASA builds a brand new rocket from scratch in less than 14 days so they can send Damon a fresh load of unlimited supplies. It explodes immediately after takeoff because Ridley Scott still has another hour to fill. Meanwhile Damon accidentally blows up his potatoes. NASA's lone Chinese employee suddenly remembers that his uncle has a private rocket he's never got around to using, so they phone China and ask if NASA can borrow it. The uncle agrees so the Chinese government sends it into space immediately, where it is instead caught by Damon's astronaut colleagues, who nick all the supplies. Meanwhile Damon is travelling to the other side of the planet, where he intends to escape using a previously unsuspected bonus rocket that just happens to be lying around the place in perfect working order.  Damon can't carry his unlimited supply of water and only has enough room in his vehicle for a few sandwiches, but by a remarkable stroke of luck it turns out that his body is capable of indefinite peak physical performance despite minimal hydration and a complete lack of nutrition, so that's OK. Also it turns out that the gravity on Mars is exactly the same as Earth's, so he hasn't lost any muscle tone. Damon arrives at the bonus rocket and is told by NASA that it's actually too heavy to lift off the planet despite being designed for that exact purpose (???) The only solution is to remove the nose of the rocket, which is actually easier than it sounds because the entire spacecraft is made of Lego and can be easily disassembled by a single undernourished man with no tools. With the nose of the rocket removed, Damon risks being killed by the extreme physical pressure generated by takeoff. NASA points out that a simple tarpaulin is strong enough to protect him, so he finds a spare one from... somewhere... and straps it on. Damon's fellow astronauts pair their ship with his rocket using Bluetooth, and take over the controls. Damon is almost crushed to a pulp as the rocket leaves Mars, because it turns out that tarpaulin isn't as strong as industrial steel after all. Somebody on the astronauts' ship blows something up because of reasons, and this somehow makes it easier for one of them to rescue Damon, who has jumped out of his rocket and is now flying towards their ship with the aid of a hole in the finger of his space suit and an unlimited supply of pressurised oxygen. NASA is helpfully streaming this heroic rescue to the entire planet using their magical realtime HD stream, because of course they are. Damon and his fellow astronauts arrive home safely just a few hours later, and Damon is rewarded with a free pair of glasses. Henceforth, everyone must call him 'Doctor.' Because doctors have glasses. I rate The Martian at 13.32 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a mediocre 4/10 on IMDb.What do you get when political correctness takes precedent over good movie making? (If telling you why this move is terrible qualifies as a spoiler then beware) This movie can be summed up with one word... vapid. As if Matt Damon's inherently vapid acting weren't bad enough, the makers of this film were so overtly focused on presenting an idyllic reality where no character behaves in any offensive way, to anybody, they produced an un-suspenseful, uninteresting, boring, vapid turd of a story. They fall over themselves to be so certain that no minority demographic is stereotyped that all characters have the sane vapid personality. And in what seems to be some sort of perverse effort to recompense reality, a very transparent hierarchy is followed to be certain that: the Black people are the most clever; the Hispanic people are next most clever; the Asian people are next most clever(carefully not portrayed as exceptionally smart), and of course the women are more clever than the men. Of course the only flawed demographic were older white male authority figures. To me this liberal, philosophical portrayal of what an ideal reality is reveals that they are the true bigots, the haters. They hate the differences that make people interesting. Ethnicity, femininity / masculinity, and their different traits should be loved and celebrated, not shamed, muted, or eliminated. It is the interaction of those differences that create an interesting story, not a vapid one.another pathetic movie of Ridiculous Scott because I care about the future, I looked forward to this movie. But while i watched it, it was a struggle to make it to the end. I'm very disappointed. Easily i blame the director, but there is a bigger production team who failed. They created a film of shallow, lame, cliché stereotypes with bad developed characters. It's all about the hero. It's not about "Matt Damon in his best role". When he's suppose to be funny, it's the worst. Jessica Chastain was brilliant in Interstellar, so now she lights up another successful chapter of imaginary human spaceflight ? Sorry, I much more think of a massive loss of image. If you wish to make future NASA look smart, cute and sexy, do not pick Jeff Daniels as it's director ! Every time 'Teddy' shows up, I expected Jim Carrey dancing to the disco sound. It wasn't even funny once to blame Lewis for her taste of music, and it wasn't funny to blame her again and again.  Please, Mister Scott, if you grab one more time into the box of stereotypes and transform actors like Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and Michael Peña into fools: retire ! Thank you. P. S. Hold on, you didn't fail on Mackenzie Davis, she made NASA look cute.Unintentionally funny, otherwise OMG awful! I watched this movie with a friend who has no technical background, and she pronounced it good. I should note that my friend is Canadian, and with the possible exception of Neil Young, Canadians are an innately polite people. Meanwhile, being American, I was laughing internally until I spotted.  I also note that I knew the author of the book (when he was a kid) through a workplace and personal friendship with his father. Andy Weir is an incredibly gifted science geek, as is his dad. I therefore know that none of the gross scientific transgressions in the film can be blamed on his ignorance. Andy openly admits to willfully ignoring a few things like the thin Martian atmosphere in the interest of moving the story forward. He correctly understood the impatience of miseducated Americans with annoyances such as basic laws of physics. IOW, he took the movie money and ran, like the smart kid I know him to be.  So I would say that any idiotic disregard of science on screen—the use of Visqueen and duct tape to secure a 6 foot hole vacated by (richly ironic) a blown hatch cover against a 50,000 pound pressure gradient, for example—resulted either from production or directorial indifference. The list of anti-Newtonian horrors goes on, and gets funnier, particularly when Matt Damon punctures his space glove and uses the escaping oxygen to propel himself toward his rescuer. Next, I was half expecting the crew of the rescuing spacecraft to line up, bend over, and torch off an ensemble fart to correct a course deviation. In any case, this movie was not intended to portray a real human battle against nature, as was so wonderfully chronicled in Apollo 13. Rather, The Martian was intended to make money by playing on current themes of political correctness and the warm fuzzies of international cooperation, framed by the awesomeness of space. It fails spectacularly even at this wretched goal—not at making money, you understand, but the furtherance of World Peace—placing its bets on star power, flaccid dialogue, dumbass jokes and cheap CGI effects instead of a solid script, good acting and a credible stab at realism. Jeff Daniels as the director of NASA? My God... Watch this movie only if you're looking for something to distract you from doing something more useful, such as expressing the dog's impacted anal glands. Higher emotional content can be found by chopping up an onion.The worst thing about this movie Spoilers below.  The worst thing about about this movie was that everything is so hard to believe because it's such nonsense. It doesn't follow basic physic laws. It doesn't take much to get me invested in a movie as a viewer, but this just goes too far. The absolute worst flaw is not even all the fake science, nor I'd it the overuse of disco music or the fact that the astronaut doesn't really get desperate and only makes cheesy jokes... No, it's the fact that China's space program has some secret spaceship which they want to reveal and give up for the eyes of the world to save one unknown American dude. That just doesn't make any sense. First of all, China could care less, also, why give up a rocket on which you've been apparently working in secret, just to send food up to space? And if all this would happen for some strange reason... America responds with 'ok. I see. Thank you'. Hangs up and goes ' yessssssss.' Idiotic.NASA promotes the rape of science for tax-payer money. I had low expectations of this film, and not to my surprise, my expectations where more then fulfilled. After watching this terrible movie, I looked up the reviews on the Internet and was disappointed that so many reviews of sites and movie-critics where so positive. It felt like I was truly alone on this world. For me, the movie was sh*t, but everyone thinks it was great. Wat is wrong with me. But today, I started reading the reviews of some fellow IMDb- reviewers, and finally I see what is wrong. Only an intelligent person would perceive this movie as cr*p, but since most people are morons, that explains all the positive reviews. I can only perceive this waste of pellicule as a promotion-movie for NASA. They probably want to gear up to get more tax-payer money for their upcoming research to get people to Mars. Believe me, this will be money wasted. People will never walk on Mars, seeing the current situation on this planet. The movie was a travesty, where science and doing the math was used as a continuous red line to explain everything. I really didn't see any math or science in this movie. It was more like a lotto contestant who won every game, against all odds. The astronaut was a botanist. WHAT??? That was the easy part. Planting some potato's in Mars-dust, and fertilize them with sh*t, in a dark environment does not give you a full 100% harvest of potato-plants. Believe me, I have done the math, in earth soil. He was also a doctor, an electronics engineer, a chemist, a programmer, a mechanic, a psychologist and what what more. An astronaut for me, should be a civil engineer, with a specialization in whatever field in science, but certainly NOT a botanist. Unbelievable. And where did he get all of his oxygen? After getting his helmet ruptured and taping it off, he was down to 10% oxygen, but after a few seconds all was back to normal. Heh? If you want more discrepancies, read some more reviews with low stars. This film is full of it. Ridiculous Scott, stop making more movies, you seem to suffer of the self-delusion that you are a Sci-Fi director. Nuff said.Whatever happened to good space movies? Underwhelming and boring movie, can't understand how it gets so much acclaim and good reviews in general. The theme of man overcoming challenges through "science" sprinkled with disco music here and there to awaken viewers along the way and raise their spirits felt cliché and didn't make it for me. The film just felt somewhat void and foreseeable. I think it lacked suspense and if I may "planetary or space awesomeness", but of course that is not the mood the film aims at, so you can blame me for judging it from my expectations rather than than considering the movie in itself. However, to me it seems almost like a movie about Mars had to be made and this is what we got. You would expect something special coming from Ridley Scott, or maybe not after the disappointment of Prometheus (for me that film deflated at about the equator and contained some odd script and dialogue nonsense) What happened to old good space movies?Thrilling Sci-Fi Survival Adaptation In an era where science-fiction survival tales are becoming a popular occurrence - with 'Interstellar' last year, and 'Gravity' the year before - writer Andy Weir and sci-fi connoisseur Ridley Scott team up to craft a complex tale that is carried by a single character, that character being Mark Watney, played fantastically by Matt Damon (Hollywood's biggest calamity, who requires being rescued... again). As the film tees off, we are instantly given a first-person view of the dangers of Mars and the fight for survival each astronaut is living out each day on the planet's surface, that is until their emergency evacuation - but nope, even Damon couldn't do that right. Abandoned upon the desolate surface of Mars after being presumed dead by his crew, Damon must do all he can to endure the martian environment. One huge thing I admire about this film's plot, is that it doesn't care about the intellectual level of its audience, as the quote above states so well: it'll science the s**t out of them. It's such a complex and well-executed premise that on paper seems nothing more than a impossible feat to pull off. Technically this film is stunning, the cinematography, the CGI, the production design, all utterly gorgeous, and according to the Golden Globes, it's one of the best comedies of recent years too... yeah, sure. Admittedly the tongue-in-cheek humour does add a more fresh appeal to the film, making it a little more unique than previous sci-fi adventures, it piles on layers of thrills, emotional value and complex character development to create one of the finest science fiction films of recent years.Were all the scientists on a day off when this script was written? Wow this was a bad one, I thought Interstellar was painful but this was even worse (I know hard to believe!) My favourite part in the whole movie was when Matt points out that an explosion which occurred in a particular room during an experiment he was conducting was due to (you'll love this!) him exhaling too much oxygen into the room! Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure we exhale CO2 and inhale O2. I think even a fifth grader would be able to tell me that. I nearly cried with laughter when I heard him say that line and how he kept a straight face is beyond me, unless he thinks its true of course. This was just the beginning of the lack of believable science in this movie and it was so painful to watch after more and more random unbelievable events started popping up. His one line killed the movie for me, from that point on I was looking for more "errors" and they just kept on coming. Anyway to cover the opening sequence with how poor Matt ends up left on Mars to die, well there's a big storm that no one seems coming, they all rush to their landing vehicle to hot tail it back up to their orbiting mothership. Matt gets a whack in the gut with something (which we later find out pierced his suit completely but yet somehow the suit manages to stay pressurised with a hole in it) and decides to pass out. The rest of the crew fly back up to the mothership and, get this, immediately set course for home! They don't stay in orbit for say another 24 hours and recover Matt's body they just leg it back home asap. Odd I thought for a NASA mission to just abandon him and not say bring the body back for his family to bury. When poor Matt wakes up he finds all the communications are down and all his friends gone. And by communications I mean the one satellite dish that was stuck to the habitat roof has blown down in the storm and been completely demolished, but not one of the solar panels outside is damaged, just a bit sandy. Seeing how comms back to Earth would be one of the critical systems would there not be 3 or 4 other methods of calling home, redundancies in case of a disaster? NASA didn't see the point in having any of those backups on this mission to Mars, what could possibly go wrong? Another good one is when he is told to drill and cut a whole in the roof of a perfectly airtight rover and sticky tape a big plastic balloon to the top of it. No reason is given for this yet it happens, I think it's so he can take some more plastic painting sheets with him but I cant be certain. Also wouldn't this drilling and cutting a big hole compromise the pressurisation integrity rendering the vehicle unsafe to drive around in without a space suite on, oh but not for Matt, he happily drives around Mars with no suit on at all with his new plastic sticky taped sunroof fitted trying to work out how far he can get on his batteries while whinging about how he'll never make it to the RV due to lack of power all the while singing along to the stereo with more flood lights turned on than at a football stadium. Um turn some crap off Matt that'll save you some juice. Again another scene in the movie, an airlock somehow gets blown to bits and a big gaping whole is left in the side of the habitat Matt lives in. The solution, a big piece of plastic sheet and more sticky tape, he then repressurises the habitat and somehow his sticky taped plastic painting sheet is able to hold up fine, outside there are wild storms going on (which are visible through a few of the more believable looking pressurised windows) raging away and not one single piece of debris punches through his plastic painting drop sheet or does any damage to his rover or solar panels. The mission to get him home is to send back the craft which ran away and left him in the beginning. NASA didn't tell the crew of the ship for months that he was still alive as they didn't want to hurt their feelings! So the plan to get him back is drive the mothership all the way back to Earth, do some gravity sling shot thing around Earth (sounds like Apollo 13?) rendezvous with a supplies pod (food and movies onboard probably) and fly all the way back to Mars and pick him up as he fires himself into space from a lander (after stripping out all the gear inside, removing the roof and covering it with another plastic painting sheet held on with sticky tape to save weight) already there for the next disastrous mission to Mars NASA has already cooked up. For me this movie just went too far, way beyond what any normal person with a even a tiny grasp of science can cope with. I cannot believe Ridley, NASA and JPL were happy to have their names mentioned let alone their relevant ground breaking departments portrayed with such a lack of any real science. I know it's a SciFi movie but you have to get the basics right and have some kind of explanation for the viewer to be able to buy into the ludicrous things which take place in the movie. Otherwise it just becomes a complete bore to watch and the viewer spends their time looking for more flaws. My opinion, save yourself the money, stay home, get a pizza in &amp; watch Blade Runner on BluRay again :-)Insulting Do not trust any review above 2 stars. I think such users are payed reviewers. I went to watch this "movie" not expecting much, but what i get was a total frustration.  I'd like to get a refund for the ticked i payed because i felt cheated. The movie is insulting to human intelligence. Totally pointless, superficial and from a scientific point of view, is an insult to every scientist. In addition i hope the NASA will call the production to a courtyard for how they have been represented in the movie.  Acting is quite often terrible too, no psychological immersion, all is a joke and with a little montage everything become possible... this movie is a waste of money and time, i want my money back!!! Do not waste money and time over this one! THE SPOILER PART REAT AT YOUR OWN DISCRECTION:  Think about : 1- growing potato over a soil not tested fertilized with astronauts "poo"... what about bacteria ? What about soil minerals and PH ? ... why he had potatoes in a martian station? (that's a joke) 2- why there is no scientific team studying and calculating ? Just a bunch of guys wandering around saying "yes" to the big boss or the minor actor acting like the "genius" ??  3- No information control at the NASA center??? Are you kidding me ??? An astronauts left alone over mars, does a real-time chatting with a "guy" (not even a psychologist) and such conversations are real-time public shared !!!! ARE YOU F*****G KIDDIN ME?????  4- sorry i forgot to mention that in such movie radiation are totally ignored, as you will never see the reflecting visor down even in "free space" while glancing at sun There are tons of those nonsenses in the movie... i just have time to write down 4, but all the movie is 2 hours of such nonsenses. TO CONCLUDE: this "movie" is an insult to the viewer, who liked it does ignore even the basic concepts of science, a terrible superficial plot. This "movie" is a scam, a fraud to steal our money. I've been cheated, listen to me and don't be fooled keep you time and money for something better.Not a good movie at all, can;t understand why people like it. Okay, I am also perplexed as to why people have given this terrible movie a favorable review. It seems like all we care about is a big name director and big star, then the movie has instant credibility. There was not one truly memorable moment in this movie. I cannot remember a single word, phrase, exchange of dialogue, or turn of event that left a lasting impression. The only positives were Matt Damon's likability and some decent special effects. For one thing how can this premise be taken ass even remotely plausible? Does anyone think that we would send ship to Mars that is vulnerable to a naturally and regularly occurring storm on Mars? And who would design a ship that is docked so perilously? It was standing up like one of those red/white/blue popsicle rocket treats we used to get from the ice cream man as a kid. Or even more than that it looked like a ship from a 1950's era sci-fi movie. C'mon man, this is a new millennium. Make a ship that is supported as it would be supported on Mars. It should be shorter and more stable, not doomed to tip over like shown in the movie. That one scene lost me for the next 30 minutes. Here are the other things I feel left me wanting with that movie. 1. When the storm struck I didn't know who was left behind. I knew it was the Matt Damon character but I didn't "know" him, meaning I had no emotional investment in that character. 2. He was a botanist, how convenient. His character didn't have to transform or change in any way in order to survive; he was the perfect guy to be left behind. 3. And just why were the potatoes going to run out??? They said you have 400 and something days, but never said why. Was it because there were other vital nutrients that would be lacking at that point? 4. If you give me 2 years to figure out how to solve a problem that means my survival, and there's nothing else to do but figure it out, I bet I'l find something too. The dates before his food was going to run out were so far out that I never felt a sense of urgency. You can call Mars "The Monster" but it wasn't pursuing the main character, just waiting for him to run out of food. How boring is that??? 5. When was the last time we saw nobody but good guys in a movie? There was nobody to blame, no bad guys anywhere. That was just plain weak. A bad guys doesn't have to be a bad person, just a person who either has too much fear or fears the wrong thing, which causes him/her to make poor choices. Nobody served as a villain in any way. I know from playing sports and working in small and large companies that there's always a person who feels like the bad guy, even unintentionally. This movie, with it's little slice of heaven, was absurd to say the least. For these reasons and other minor reasons I was totally disappointed. My wife liked it and I couldn't understand why. This was the dumbest movie I've seen in a long time. I really wanted to like ti but was terribly disappointed.The Martian: "Cast Away" Meets "Apollo 13" The Martian is a new Ridley Scott classic, featuring his best work in years, the best performance I've ever seen from Matt Damon, an outstanding supporting cast, a surprisingly funny screenplay from Daredevil creator Drew Goddard, and a great narrative that ties the film together beautifully.  As expected with Ridley Scott films, the film itself is visually stunning. The landscape of Mars looks absolutely breathtaking, and the scenes aboard the Hermes and back on Earth are just as sharp in detail and scope. The way he chose to make this film made it almost seem like an exceptionally made biopic. Many times during this film, I legitimately believed that Mark Watney was a real, living person that was actually stranded on Mars for many months alone. It's Cast Away meets Apollo 13, and this marriage is crafted beautifully.  Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant in this film. He plays Watney with so much optimism that it actually makes the depressing aspect of the film not as depressing for me. However, when he has to put on his dramatic chops in certain scenes, he truly commits to the drama of the situation, and that right there is true Ridley Scott suspense for you. The supporting cast, everyone involved, all do great work as well. Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor. He is one of the best actors working today, and this movie and 12 Years a Slave shows how far he's come.  The most surprisingly element about this movie though was the screenplay. The film is hilarious in some parts, in fact I'd argue that it's funnier than most comedies that have come out this year. What makes to movie unique to me was Watney's optimistic point of view. He believes that he isn't going to die on Mars, and this transforms this rather depressing situation into something comical instead. But when you really think about it, this is a very personal film about some people coming together to save somebody. That's it. And in today's world, it's nice to hear an story about people coming together to save one of their own.  I have nothing bad to say about The Martian. It's the best film I've seen all year.The Martian: A Classic by all means. I read some of the reviews and decided to review this title myself. That's because I'd like you not to miss this lovely movie. It got some very bad criticism (Reviews&amp;Ratings first page hosts at least 4 reviewers rating this title '1', lowest possible value on IMDb), most of which deals with Physics laws bended to screenwriter's desire.  Well I just want to reassure you that even though I am among the nerdiest guys on the Internet, I didn't get annoyed from what I saw. Not once. And if you weren't annoyed by Tom Hanks and his boys killing almost an entire German Division before giving up in 'Save Private Ryan' you won't be annoyed too. It's a movie, not a documentary. And it's a great movie, a classic by all means.I Am The Only One Who Was Not Disappointed Having read the book, and being very impressed, I was looking forward to the movie interpretation. I was not the least bit disappointed. I was hoping this movie would not be an overacted, overproduced and sappy version of the original, and I was pleasantly surprised that the story played out without the overblown extraneous embellishment that Hollywood seems to depend on so often. It was great to see how the screenplay added extra material that was not in the book, and it enhanced the story to make it even better. The characters were interpreted with full respect to the intention of the author, Andy Weir, and nothing was overdone. The pacing and editing of this movie was some of the best I've seen, in fact, some of the one-liners from the book are done so quickly it pushed the story forward relentlessly.  One thing that struck me is that everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I think that could be a testament to the originality and uniqueness of the book. I believe anyone who reads the book is captivated and involved with the story from beginning to end, and it's possible this comes across in all phases of the production; the acting, the sets, sound, everything. They all knew they had some great material to work with and ran with it.I'm giving up on Ridley Scott! Man, I was so disappointed by this movie! Did I have too high expectations? I don't think so. If you have a bunch of actually Hollywood-A-class actors and a director who made "Blade Runner" and "Alien", you are officially allowed to have expectations! But they all failed terribly in my opinion. I could rant about the bad jokes, the awful soundtrack and the cheesy 3D-renderings - why didn't they manage one single time to make these things, the ship, the rover, actually look big? It all looked like toys! Awful! But my biggest complaint is the terrible storytelling! The movie had zero suspense from beginning to end. It was always, hey we have a problem, let's have a cool dialog/monologue, and then, hey, we'll solve the problem within the next minute - no problem at all! Hey, I got no milk in the fridge, OK I'll get some from the supermarket... That level of depth. I didn't feel for one single minute with the main character and I couldn't have cared less, when he had died in the end. There was at some points emotional music and we all were told, that this and that is dangerous and what not. But I couldn't feel it at all. Just for comparison: "Gravity" had me on the edge of the seat and "Interstellar" had me hold my breath. Not to mention "Moon", "Blade Runner" and "Odyssee". Wasn't there a time, when Ridley Scott made actually great movies? Do yourself a favor and spend the money on something else. This movie isn't worth it.Project Elrond A NASA crew on Mars evacuates during a bad storm, Mark (Matt Damon) is believed dead and is left behind. However, he is not dead and needs to be resourceful to survive until the next mission, over a year away. However it it not as bad as "Gravity" or "Cast Away" without Wilson. Mark (plot spoiler revealed in previews) manages to make contact with Earth and we have a subplot to break up the monotony of a one man play. The film is designed primarily for science geeks. There is a lot of terms for them, many are broken down, some inanely as when a sling shot effect had to be explained to the head of NASA, something they do all the time. With all the hype of an Oscar nomination, I thought the film would have been better. It was good, I enjoyed it, but I don't believe it belongs in the Science Fiction hall of fame. There are no space aliens, ghosts, or anything crazy like that. Science fiction, not science fantasy. As far as science goes, my understanding is that Martian soil has a high perchlorate content hindering plant growth. Also NASA is leery of sending anyone to Mars as the radiation dose they will get on a round trip would be considered a lifetime dose for the astronauts, ending their careers and greatly increasing the risk of a latent radiation induced cancer etc. Fantastic film Excellent film: the science is accurate, the acting is solid, and the film carries an emotional depth that previous reviewers, who have been panning it, seem to have missed (but maybe they're not used to films where spaceships DON'T make noise in the vacuum in space and the audience actually has to think). One of Ridley Scott's best films.A film about growing potatoes with poop A film about growing potatoes with poop. That's it.Fantastic It was well made, sure, but Childish Gambino was in it, so it's fantastic. Too bad Sean Bean did not die. Was disappointed. That'll happen.Great EFX but a bit preposterous, boring, yet spellbinding? With 1100 reviews, I suppose that few people may read this, but here goes: Fantastic sets and special effects. I wish I had seen this on a big screen. I am sure that it has been compared to everything from "2001" to "Apollo 13". It seems a bit tedious, but that might be because of the 3 hour cable broadcast time if you don't DVR it. An astronaut presumed dead is accidentally left behind when a long-term Mars Mission is aborted due to an intense hurricane force Martian sand storm is encountered. The first third of the movie centers on how Astronaut "Mark" manages to set up housekeeping, grow his own crops, and re-establish communications with Houston Control. Then it shift gears and become a rescue mission much like Apollo 13. There are equipment failures along the way and the mission crew almost commits mutiny when they decide to double back and rescue the stranded man. Smart and intelligently presented by Ridley Scott but not everyone's "cup of tea". I enjoyed it but found many badly-answered plot hole questions: There seems to be an unlimited supply of oxygen in the space suits. Maybe they can manufacture it in the suit? The "Power of Duct Tape" creates a perfect air seal. (I guess it really is the handyman's secret weapon?) A partial nudity shower scene is really unnecessary. Even after a clear plastic seal blows out, the entire craft doesn't fog up and blow apart? Oh, well, enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect it all to make perfect sense.The Martian Damon died in a challenge inside and outside the film. The movie Mars may not be a logical or purely scientific film, but certainly succeeded in satisfying everyone as a film science fiction exciting. The film is directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon and Jessica Shastin. It is believed that Mark has died and left alone on Mars, and begins a struggle to survive while trying to communicate. On earth, in the hope of saving him, Marc remains without a thing in this planet, which is twice as large as the Earth, and there is nothing but himself and what the crew left before the forced departure. One of the film's problems that you may read about is the storm that led to Mark's departure in the first place. Mars's atmosphere is about 1% as compared to the Earth, so Mars winds, which may reach 100 mph "which is rare in the Mars climate" would be like winds at ten miles an hour on Earth, Flying a paper plane in the sky not to fall humans. Beyond that film is excellent in almost all respects, since the beginning of the film can not stop stunned by what Ridley Scott of visual effects, and continue to amaze something something with the stages of passage of the film. The film begins in a desert desert similar to the environment of Mars, as we know from the images of him, red, arid, empty, filled with horrifying silence. The film moves to two stages. The film then moves to two sides, the psychological aspect of Mark being that he has nothing more than he can think of getting to his home and family, and the aspect that makes him one of the most responsible and discoverable people. Here lies the details, the film may not be perfect in writing. Both are in these two sides. When you see a movie that tells the story of the horror of loneliness, you have to think of two aspects (psychological and physical). The physical aspect I thought for a moment was that Matt Damon's work was a mighty example until I knew that the whole thing was just an effect on a computer, which increases visual dazzling and its effects and reduces The actor's creativity and sacrifices for the role.  In an interview with Matt Damon, he said he wanted to lose weight for the role, but director Ridley Scott stopped him. "He talked to Ridley about losing weight for the role, because I had already done it for the movies, Almost a month ago I said that the time is perfect. I can lose 30 to 40 pounds and start shooting from the end scenes back to the beginning until I get back to my normal body. "Riddle Scott" replied "F * ck that". As for the psychological side, yes, there was a conflict, and yes, Dimon was good at it, but it was not enough for me to see the dramatic dramas, being on Mars, knowing that you are 140 million miles from Earth, home, home, family. Because you will not see human beings after today in your life, it is very frightening once you think about it, so I had a desire to stress on a dramatic scene that would be screaming and whining and then supplication and crying. but it's okay. Some may notice the American championship in the film, or even the mathematical complexities, when we calculate the number of years between Mars and the Earth or the speed of Mark's or even attraction between the planets and others, but the film certainly did not make it more sophisticated than the movie Nolan among the stars, Understand some of them and do not mind their presence, because it will not actually stop them, in turn will increase the quality of the scientific background of the film, which puts it in a challenge with the scientists who will see it. The film is not the ideal film in all its analogies, but it is certainly interesting to the viewer, a victory for Ridley Scott the rest of the workers, from the voices to the visual effects and even fashion .. A poetic and objective film at the same time, and above all we can not but stand in hugs for the creativity of Matt Damon and his grandmother to portray The scene of the dramatic car and the rest of the film with complete creativity.

The charm of the story for me is, that it heavily emphasizes the Science in Sci-Fi. The whole thing is (mostly) sound and very well explained, so even technical illiterate readers can follow. For this movie someone decide to dumb down the content and take shortcuts and - surprise - mistakes, failures and plot holes ensue and some things simply make no sense anymore (just look at the goofs list - you could make a book out of them). Then again some scenes were unnecessarily added to confuse even further to make up for plot twists that were cut. This messy screenplay can't be saved by the cast. Most of the characters are but a faint shadow of their book selves. Take crewman Vogel for example. Would anybody have guessed him to be German, if it wasn't for the patch on his suit? Jeff Daniels seems to wear a stiff neck and all the characters interactions feel like packed in cotton. Those guys should be passionate and fight for their opinions especially since the lives of astronauts are on the line and depend on their decisions. They are highly trained specialists in their field of work and have to fight against political red tape. Non of this was in the movie. They could have had a more passionate discussion about a burgers or football. And don't even get me started on the props. Think about airplane furniture and then shave that down even more to get rid of any unnecessary gram, while barely preserving basic function. Where was that in the movie? The Hub looked like it was built to house colonists for decades and not to serve as a pressurized shelter for a two month mission. The movie-Hermes consists mostly of large corridors without any purpose and large window panes. A spaceship like this would never be approved. I could go on forever, but it all boils down to this: Andy Weir went to great length to make the plot and every action the protagonist take plausible and get his book scientifically correct. That's what I love about it and why I was looking forward to the movie. And then I got handed this stupid, dumbed down, senseless piece of trash.Great, realistic, space adventure 'The Martian' is based on Andy Weir's excellent novel - one of my favourite books from last year. It's a very simple concept - in the near-future, a manned-mission to Mars goes awry and Mark Watney (Damon) is presumed dead, as the rest of the team returns to Earth. However, rumours of Watney's demise were exaggerated and he just manages to survive, only to be faced with the conundrum of how to stay alive on a freezing planet with almost no food, water or oxygen until he can be rescued? It's beautifully shot, with Jordan a good stand-in for Mars on most occasions, and the CGI doing the rest. And there's obviously a few shots of Earth from space - always a great perspective to see. Scott directs well, with the pacing good, and time spread across the strong cast - Chastain, Peña, Mara, Stan and Hennie on the spaceship home; and Daniels, Ejifor, Bean and Wiig at NASA - showing how everyone involved deals with the initial tragedy and then attempted rescue mission(s). However, the film belongs to Damon, who has to use all his charm and skills to make one man talking to a video journal interesting. The film's possibly 15min or so too long, but luckily, it's a great book &amp; a good screenplay, so there's plenty of levity to go along with the serious life-or-death/fingernail-chewing moments. Tense/great final 25min or so. Never quite reaches the heights of the book, but comes very close.Great Scott Some reviewer on this site said don't trust any reviews that give this film more than 2 stars because they aren't genuine. Well let me say having just watched it that I wouldn't trust any review that give it less than 7 stars. If this was La La Land I would have agreed as that was overrated rubbish but this was superbly crafted wonderfully acted and a joy to behold. Not at any time during its 141 mins was I not totally engrossed and exhilarated by this total cinematic experience. I'll even go as far as to say this maybe the best film that Ridley Scott has directed.Captures the excitement, humor, and humanity of the book Full disclosure: I read (and enjoyed) this book. So I'm going to be one of those people who says "They got this right, but they got this wrong." Bottom line, though, they adapted this REALLY well. Scott captured what survival and problem solving looks like, and managed all the excitement/humor/humanity that made the book great. I would have loved a little more explanation and a little less self-seriousness, but there's no way not to enjoy this ride.Smart, thrilling, and surprisingly funny Super good, enjoyed this one a lot. Sort of a mix of Castaway and Gravity with Matt Damon taking on the deserted Hanks role, explaining things to a video diary along the way after he is left stranded on Mars and presumed dead by his crew. With meager supplies he must find a way to contact Earth, make oxygen and grow some food. Its very funny. This did feel a bit too long but in saying that I also can't think of any scenes that were unnecessary. Great special effects and finally a movie using CGI and green screens to enhance the movie not just BE the movie as is often the case these days, where movies forget about a story and just become special effect extravaganzas. It did get a bit over-the-top towards the end with Damon in his Ironman reminiscent suit but I went with it. Worth a watch. Oh, this is based on a book by Andy Weir.Globe Earth Propaganda The most unrealistic part of this movie, is not the fact that Matt Damon started a potato farm out of his own feces in space, but THE PREPOSTEROUS FACT THAT SPACE AND OTHER PLANETS EXIST!1! As a Christian Mom, I must tell you that the whole idea behind space, planets and even a globe earth is so unrealistic that I had to remove my 7 children from the cinema mid-way through and then perform an exorcism on them. I tried to contact Hollywood and demand this movie is removed from all cinemas within Christian governed nations but they wouldn't answer my e-mails or my calls. Alas I am here to try and convince all Christian citizens of the World, to avoid this movie like the plague. Also i'd like to inform you that NASA is a satanic organisation that throws arsenic in our water supply and that vaccines are made of sin. This movie proudly displays the ridiculous idea of space, which I am pretty sure is a myth (just like physics and sanitation). The only reason I am giving this movie is getting anything more than a 1/10 is because of Matt Damon. Check out my Matt Damon erotic fanfictions, if you want to make my Christian soul happy! :) Thank y'all. Vote Trump and don't forget that existing is a sin!

Quite soon into watching I felt that it was being strangled by political correctness. It is bland; it is beige; it is, quite simply, not compelling. Towards the end I completely lost interest in it, so little did I care about the outcome.Clunky Mess not deserving of any Oscar nominations Cant believe this was nominated for 7 Oscars.  Matt Damon plays a scientist of sorts, in fact a botanist who after an accident is left on mars alone ,to survive he starts fertilising potatoes with his own excrement . What started brightly decent soon descended into a clunky mess which left me rolling my eyes. The scenes on earth with NASA were cringey and i was saying to myself no one talks like that in real life, it was like i was watching a Judd Apatow film ,Kristen Wiig has about 2 lines of dialogue but appears in the background in almost every scene looking on the verge of a stroke ,then there's Damon who had zero background to his character -are we led to believe that a scientist left on a distant planet thousands of miles away from home , doesn't suffer any adverse affects other than weight loss, doesn't feel any anger or anxiety or any other emotion, to cope he just makes corny jokes and listens to disco music Absurd premise with no depth or emotion and if wasn't directed by Ridley Scott it would of passed through the cinema without notice. Scott is the most overrated director going.several science mistakes in this movie Probably The Most Weird bit of all is the fact that Matt says that an explosion from a sort of water generator was caused by the excess OXYGEN that he breathed out: 1. You breath out co2 not oxygen 2. you would not cause an explosion by breathing a single breath of wind 3. How would like 10gs of wood chips burn for some like: 200 sols? he would need 10 kg instead of grams. Duct tape does not help in taping together a hole. It just doesn't. And I don't see any seals in that. all there is is a tarp and a few straps and duct tapes strips to seal it together. Mark uses duct tape to fix his spacesuit, attach a dangerous plutonium reactor, and to seal of a giant hole in the wall of the HAB, the base of the mission. The alarming fact is that it is 100% worrying when you hear the flapping sound of the tarp, and sending a person on a rocket ship with its nose cut off and replaced with a tarp is totally nonsensical.  Overall, This is an okay movie but if you are one of those experts on film better not watch it. or if you are a scientist.Golden Globe for comedy, comedians miscast in serious roles. ABBA soundtrack. Contrived to make money. Awful, awful. This movie may have been initially popular, but it will fade away. To better imagine being on Mars I had to mute the sound to imagine Watney breathing in his space suit whilst he worked, You do get the impression of being on Mars but this is not sustained because of the comedic overtones and stupendous miscasting. I imagined another version being released in the future - a true space drama- deleting the wisecracks, replacing the soundtrack, and reinforcing the success factors such as the sense of isolation, the science, and the fear. But that's not going to happen. People forget this movie is a comedy, yet it is thoroughly unfunny, but it did win a Golden Globe for comedy. Touché from the accountants! Audiences do love an optimistic fantasy depicting triumph over adversity. And what fantasy! The sandstorm that stranded Watney would be no more fierce than being pelted by talcum powder given Mars thin atmosphere. The storm would barely raise a flag. And then there is Watney. Perpetual optimist, says he's a botanist, but botanists are not farmers nor gardeners. The garden he creates is ridiculous, too shallow with no drainage, and the crop yield fantastical (see one of the reviews below which explores this in detail). Watney doesn't suffer much. He is playful, always strong, optimistic, jovial, confident. I don't see him triumphing over adversity."Apollo 13" Meets "Interstellar"But Not Quite As Good As Either "The Martian" is a solid movie. It has an interesting plot, some good character development, and (in a complete departure from most Ridley Scott films) contains a very hopeful, at times even light-hearted tone. Most people viewing this will find it a very enjoyable experience all-around. Here is the problem, though: About a year ago, "Interstellar" was made by Christopher Nolan. It shares many similar character types and themes with "The Martian"but manages to beat it in nearly every single area. So, I have to say that it was a little weird seeing this movie and thinking that not only it wasn't as good as "Interstellar", but now it is chronologically second-fiddle too. For a basic plot summary, "The Martian" primarily tells the story of a member of the Aries III crew exploring Mars sometime in Earth's future. A violent windstorm picks up and astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is flung off into the eye of the storm and presumed dead, his fellow crewmates having to make a tough decision and a quick getaway. Due to some incredible luck, however, Watney is most certainly not deadjust stranded on Mars with few supplies and not enough food to last until any sort of retrieval mission can be furnished. The catch? Watney is a scientist (a botanist, to be exact), and must tap into all of his ingenuity and wits in order to survive until NASA can pick him up again. Like I said, "The Martian" is a pretty good movie when looked at with tunnel-vision. It has all the right ingredients for a great sci-fi drama, and those ingredients do indeed gel together to form an entertaining final product. It has some high-concept themes, impressive visuals, and that sense of gravitas befitting films like "Apollo 13". Damon turns in a great performance, and his scenes are the highlight of the entire experience (had the movie focused on him even more exclusively, I probably would have liked it even better!). There are indeed two major problems that keep this film from being a classic sci-fi adventure, though: 1. The casting besides Damon is very poor. Jeff Daniels is terrible as the head of NASA, as is Kristen Wiig in a similar corporate role, and Jessica Chastain's character is inexplicably under- utilized. As such, the scenes where Damon isn't front-and-center really drag the fun to a halt. 2. Maybe this isn't 100% fair, but it still stands that this movie can't really hold a candle to Nolan's masterful "Interstellar", and that turned into kind of a problem during the viewing experience. I mean, think of it this way: A film featuring Chastain, Damon, space travel, space anomalies, and all set in a very hopeful tone. Where have you seen that movie before? I know that "The Martian" is based on a book and thus it is difficult to scream "plagiarism" too loud, but having not read the book I really don't know how closely it was followed. To me, then, this sure seemed like an opportunity to capitalize on the success by using the same general themes of the previous "Interstellar". Bottom line: Had I seen this movie a year or so ago, I may have liked it considerably more. However, once one has seen movies like "Interstellar" before it, it kind of feels old-hat. Not a bad movie by any means (and hence the four-star rating), but also not all that close to being one that will be remembered for years, either.What is a long movie or it felt really long? Better read the synopsis before watching The Martian. I did not. That's why I thought it would be some fun sci-fi movie about astronauts landing in Mars and having to defend themselves from the attack of creatures from another planet. Well, that wasn't what the movie was, and I wish it would be. The first hour of the Martian felt long, dragging and utterly boring. Matt Damon, left alone by himself in Mars spends the first half of the movie regurgitating technicalities to a camera where he records himself while explaining what he has to do to survive alone in this new "home". If he didn't it would be just impossible for people to understand all the things he is doing. In the second half the movie, a rescue mission gets ready to pick him up, so they talk an talk and talk again in endless meetings about what needs to be done to save their man while the world is watching. Although this second part is slightly more entertaining than the first one, I really could not wait for the movie to finish. Boring! It's all i can say.Not Equal to the Hollywood Hype If it's a cold rainy night and you have nothing to do, curl up with a bag of popcorn, and you'll find this film is an OK diversion, but if you're expecting the next Apollo 13, or Stanley Kubrick classic, you will be disappointed.  The basic plot is the typical adventure, action, suspense formula with rather predictable turns and barely enough of predicable problems which the scientists will have to solve just in the nick of time.  The real problems with The Martian are centered around the script and character development. The script could have been written by seventh graders who were given bonus points for trying to write as many cliché lines as possible. What's worse, is the fact that none of the characters including that of Matt Damon's have any real development as people with whom you can empathize. Good dram is always more than the actions of the plot. Good drama is about people and their relationships, conflicts, struggles, etc. We know nothing about these people and therefore can never develop the empathy necessary for good engaging drama.  Lots of great visuals, some bad disco music, and an OK story line.Basically it's "Cast Away" set on another planet I saw this movie with friends and enjoyed it, although I found it to be strangely reminiscent of CAST AWAY, staring Tom Hanks. The best parts are when the stranded Astronaut uses his scientific knowledge growing potatoes to stretch his food supply and his calculations in seeking out and finding/reactivating the Pathfinder lander. Those scenes illustrate the kind of psychology one would need to survive while being stranded on Mars with limited resources. Damon does a fine job in these moments. The rest of the movie is kind of melodramatic, even thought Jeff Daniels made a convincing NASA Administrator. The ending is a bit silly, as tearing his spacesuit would have killed him rather quickly, not propelled him far enough to reach the ship commander. A lot of that was just the melodrama to make it more exciting. I understand the book ending was much different. Overall a decent movie and an excellent one for planetary colonization enthusiasts to watch. There is a good bit of science fact mixed with the fiction part. It's basically CAST AWAY, except on Mars.  For movies of this genre, I prefer the setting of MOON as a more possible scenario with the mining operation. Just my personal take.2015 vs. 1953 If you are either a cinema enthusiast in general or just a science fiction flicks fan, and somehow was able to sit through the entirety of "Project Moon Base" (1953) telling a story about an orbital survey mission changing into unplanned Moon landing, you can come to this conclusion: there are just light years of filmmaking between similar themed 1953 and 2015 movies. That first one does not get even the basic science elements right and has naively stupid and childish script, resulting in a picture just doomed to not withstand the test of time; while the newer "The Martian" is both so accurate / logical as a non-documentary feature can be and is technically at the highest levels Unfortunately that great distance shrinks noticeably in the middle of this newer movie, when the first part of the absolutely thrilling and entertaining Robinson "The Martian" Crusoe hits the scene of kindergarten-like pandering to the Chinese audience. (Because let us Hollywood executives and investors do not forget, that our beloved comrades on Mainland China have more cinemas than we here have in The-US-Of-A-Land and that only thirty something foreign titles per year get a full distribution in China). It slowly but inevitably shifts from an excellent survival drama with educational values to a mediocre drama with more adventure driven orientation, sticking mostly to the entertainment side. Practically it is no longer a drama but a tragedy- a tragedy of a downfall from a possible 10 / 10 picture to a flick with a score of only 6-7 / 10. For example they start to put all those "classic" (boring) songs, and not just in fragments. Why, just why did they use the excellent "All Along The Watchtower" by Jimmy Hendrix in the trailer (and for that purpose even creatively remixed it a little), but in the movie itself they took the path of least resistance of using that kitschy "Starman" by David Bowie (and in its entirety)? And that final rescue attempt, with more and more layers of obstacles? Were those space cowboy stunts really conceived some time before 2015 and not in 1953?Don't Go Anywhere Matt We're Comin back ta Get Ya.... Are you ready for a feel good movie about being left to die on Mars - well "The Matian" could be it! (could be a couple of spoilers if there's anyone left who has not already seen this one). This offers all the fun of being left out in the frozen night - then waking up next morning totally ALONE on Mars. Our astronaut (Matt Damon) has been speared in the gut and surviving in a space suit that has a hole punched in it. After some initial grueling pain we surprisingly find Matt doesn't really seem to mind all that much. Nice images, good locations, some good original score music (in between the compulsory hit-parade-chart-toppers designed for the sales promo sound-track album), then along come those assorted characters from the central casting stereo-types catalog - you know them all from just about every other big budget crowd pleaser over the past 25 years. The stony, super cool NASA chief ~ super smart female space craft commanders who show little fear or sign of human concern - simply reduced to 'gung ho' utterings like: "OK lets go get our boy"! ~ Chinese scientists willing to give away billions of dollars and years of "Top Secret" equipment and information - all just to get a nice outcome for this lone U.S. astronaut ~ understanding wives and children who smilingly wish their life partners well - after being told they've voted to put their lives on the line for a one in a thousand mission. Not enough for you? - there are many others to be found but go see for yourself. It's beginning to seem like NASA is being reduced to product placement in space. Even the the 55yr old poorly named: "Robinson Caruso On Mars" fared a little better in the human psychological stakes. 'The Martian' is really just another typical Ridley Scott movie so if you enjoy those, then none of the above will concern you - now I understand why it ended up on general cable less than a year after its Cinema release. While some of its two hrs plus is watchable, those that are lovers of fantastic big budget space adventures will actually enjoy it all but, if that's not you - then blast off with caution...oh, further warning: you may also need to dodge all those awards that were thrown at this offering.MATT...DAMON (in Team America voice) a pawn for new age space interest? Okay so randomly a frigging BOTANIST is brought to a desolate wasteland of a planet, and then left behind and somehow survives. THIS WAS FROM A STORM THAT ALL of the other astronauts fled for fear of their very lives, and the botanist survives... WTF?! In comes the fact that of all the things not on a mission that is needed for him to survive, there are bits of wood from the one token chicano guy, in the form of a wooden cross among his affects. Nobody else had religious iconography, what the hay? Then the loner breaks up the cross to use as fuel to create water for his botany experiment. He creates water like its nothing, making something NASA would not have done, at least in the film, seem ASTOUNDINGLY simplistic, for a guy whom is supposed to just be a botanist. This is beginning to reek like Gravity did. Still it distracts from all the classic low brow Damonesque slurs and cussing that has been a mark of his in acting since Good Will Hunting. ENTER THE KAKA STORM! So after digging into whats supposed to be dead soil, burying feces, by burning the lone Mexican's wooden cross, the stranded man creates virtual mini hydrogen bombs in an oxygenated environment (*faceplams*). The far too average spaceman then points out that the astronauts were supplied with a highly radioactive substance, that after hardly any use, is just dumped onto mars underneath but a few feet of ground. So already humans turn the world into a garbage dump, but its okay because Damon uses it to warm himself while humorously listening to Hot Stuff by Donna Summer. Then pausing for comedic effect.  THIS IS STUPID! Damon is literally spending most of the film on candid camera like its a reality TV show. Are we to be impressed by an actor trying so blatantly to survive upon an alien word, on a screen within a screen? Not if one has respect for themselves, let alone the art of acting.  SO then the man with the one trait he claims to have utmost expertise in just happens to dig up his crop of potatoes after barely 48 days, with potatoes bigger than some fists. FORTY EIGHT DAYS?! Either nasa found the one strain of miracle grow anywhere potatoes, or they cheapened out on the healthier organics for these space cadets' mission. Thems some gmo tatter tots, WIll Hunting.  Onward with the stupidity. So back on earth the mission command wonders where the leftover cadet is going to journey to, and instead of using most ANY of the sophisticated equipment to plan his course, they just run off to the cafeteria and use a ruler on a picture of craters and it just happens to do the trick. Really? Then comes the use of simple phrases to communicate over a vast distance, one lame nerd whom derides the point of trying at all like a useless emo teen star, and as we were about to be unintentionally woken up form this bullmess, the director just pulls folks back in. I can just see people in the theaters when this movie came out. Deplorable. This was all less than one hour into the film. I had wanted to quit, but kept watching, and was just bored as hell. Then there was more pointless babble and posing and fame from afar snap shots, then planning and untold amounts of cash spent to save one fool take form. Then came poor planning, unlikely execution and a lot of destruction of expensive equipment and wasting of air in an oxygen-less environment. He is then saved, comes home, time passes, the world is distracted from all its real problems blah blah. Later on Damon sits and marvels at a little sapling, reminding him of his martian poop factory for potatoes, all the while admired by the most racially mixed group of young astronauts jogging by him, which still was not that diverse at all. Now I already knew this was gross fiction, but come on, space programs are about as diverse as a teen clothing ad from the mid 90's. IN THE SOUTHERN STATES. Waste of my time by modern cinema, YET AGAIN! We already messed up one corner of the universe, we don't need another done in by: MATT...DAMON. But hey, its not like Hollywood is being used to make us interested in spending billions to launch off into fruitless missions without solving our problems here...OH WAIT. =_=Kind of flat Not bad, a few funny bits, a few thought provoking bits, but overall fairly flat in the acting department (with the exception of Michael Pena). Really ready for Hollywood to move on from Jessica Chastain's tough grrrrl leader roles... Her subplot at the end was farcical. Would have been nice to see a real philosophical discussion from Jeff Daniels' character about the harsh reality behind "what are you willing to pay to save one man's life". Is it worth $2 million? $20 million? $200 million? Could you have a gotten a Starbucks or Tesla owner to step up and foot the bill for a space launch? (maybe that's more criticism of the source material).Great! BEST Sci/fi movie ever!!. Awesome Matt Damon,10/10Good for the first 90 minutes but tediously overlong The first hour is interesting and engaging but the plot starts to tail off after 90 minutes and the final hour is dull and irritating. The attempts at humourous scenes fall flat and detract from the tension which has been building. Ditto the choice of music - as if 2001 A Space Odyssey had used Priscilla Queen of the Desert for its soundtrack. Ultimately, this film seems to be confused about what it wants to be. It starts out as a gripping thriller but then turns into something weirdly light-hearted. A pity, it showed promise but didn't deliver.Good film if you do not mind a little Star Trek type script... The movie mixed science fiction with a real life portrayal of life in space fairly well. Plot also examines the politics of space disasters as well. There is some Star trek dialog in the script, which may or may not turn some people off. Part of the movie that pissed me off was that it did not seem to give much credit to Rich Purnell for his idea...(see movie). Brian GhilliorriCast Away on Mars with Matt Damon The title says everything i need to say. Apart from the fact that it is far more fun to watch Tom Hanks doing nothing, than Matt Damon. I'd assume anyone rating this over a 7/10 is a Matt Damon fanboy.It's a fictional movie people; enjoy it for what it is... I watched this film and enjoyed it because it's not considered non-fiction; it's a fictional account of what might happen if an astronaut were abandoned on Mars. Too many people who are submitting reviews are trying to get too technical. People, just enjoy the movie for what it is.Strove to present correct science.....REALLY?? Generally the movie was good....lots of quasi-science which, although improbable, didn't stretch the bounds too far but the ending......really? We're supposed to believe that the rocket nose....in order to save weight, jettisons the hard cap and replaces it with....wait for it....CANVAS. If you do the math, the only speed quoted, which is BEFORE the maximum thrust, converts to about 2600 kilometers per hour. Now I've put my arm out the window at about 150 KPH and had the hair nearly blown off so I'm pretty sure 2600 KPH is more than a little improbable. Since the entire movie is predicated on hoping we will believe at least some of the science why couldn't they have just picked a smaller number to reduce it which didn't entail removing all the windows and the nosecone 'cause I'm pretty sure they'd be necessary at 2600 KPH....just saying.Never give up even if everything goes wrong. Stop and calmly think. This is an interesting story about a man who tries to survive and doesn't give up. He just doesn't give up and doesn't stress out too much, he continues working. This is what this movie is about.. It is an interesting movie and NASA and space stuff does look realistic (even though in real life it might be different actually). I really liked Jeff Daniels (guy from Dumb &amp; Dumber) character, he is very serious, a real director and made this movie more realistic, because I think that his decisions really looked like something a real life director would do (for example in the end he didn't want to risk 5 astronauts for 1).I'm going to have to review the sh*t out of this THE MARTIAN follows botanist Mark Watney who, during a manned mission to Mars, is hit by a fierce storm and left behind by his crew who presume that he's dead. But little did they know that he's still very much alive, stranded on the hostile planet. With limited resources at hand, Watney must draw upon his ingenuity in order to survive.  Having only seen the trailers, I went into this film unaware of how much humor there would actually be. In that regard, it's quite faithful to the source material; Drew Goddard was able to inherit author Andy Weir's snarky dialogue and translate it from the pages of a novel onto the pages of a screenplay, while Sir Ridley Scott brought it all to life.  Speaking of Ridley Scott, it looked as if the legendary director's best days were behind him, entering a career slump of sorts with The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings, both of which were dull and uninspired chapters of his otherwise impressive filmography. THE MARTIAN, however, marks Ridley Scott 's return to form. It's captivating from beginning to end, enjoyable from beginning to end, and is full of personality from, you guessed it, beginning to end. A lot of that personality, if not all of it, is due to the incredible group of actors that have been rounded up here, most notably Matt Damon. If not for him and the way he charismatically delivers his lines the sarcastic dialogue, which is really just Damon talking to a video recorder, would 've just ended up being really awkward. Chewitel Ejiofor and Jessica Chastain both make strong impressions as well, along with the rest of the cast who have small, yet potent moments of their own.  Despite having convincing performances, the film didn't do as good of a job trying to get me to naturally invest in these characters. Sure, you care for Mark Watney's life but that's only because of the situations that the story places him in and forces him to face; there was no real emotional through line for me to grab hold of.  But the thing that stops me from calling THE MARTIAN "great" is that it's a very safe, by the numbers, sci-fi film. It doesn't have the technical drive of Gravity or the emotional punch of Interstellar; it's very good, but it could've been so much more.Sir Ridley at his best Ridley Scott knows science fiction. The director of iconic and cult crowned sci-fi flicks Blade Runner and Alien, Scott is no slouch when it comes to futuristic or outerspaceish type scenarios played out through his keen direction. Scott last dipped his toe into the sci-fi waters in 2012 with the love it or hate it Alien prequel, Prometheus. The film was met with varying degrees of acceptance and disapproval but no one could deny the film was visually spectacular. In 2015, Scott brings Andy Weir's novel of the same name to audiences in the inspiring, The Martian due to hit theatres early October. Matt Damon plays NASA botanist Mark Watney. Watney along with a small group of other scientists are stationed on Mars when a storm prompts their evacuation. Through a series of events, his colleagues believe Watney dead as they execute their evacuation. But Watney is very much alive. Alive and alone on Mars. With little resources and materials, Watney sciences the poop out of his working assets in an effort to survive. He manages to relay a message back to earth but he is very much aware of the realization that any rescue effort or further mission to Mars is years away from actualization. Watney must live on his wits and faith in hopes that he may one day be reunited with species. The focus is clearly on Damon's character but maybe more interesting are the team of humans back on earth lead by Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels that attempt to science the poop out of things themselves in an attempt to orchestrate a spectacular rescue. Their pooling of minds will draw reference to NASA's brain trusts in Ron Howard's Apollo 13 and is riveting the exciting to watch unfold though the emotion of the colleagues. We'll leave the final chapters of the film to your viewing pleasure but make no mistake about it, The Martain is Ridley Scott's best film in years. Damon excels in the lonely character left abandoned. He carries the film with remarkable poise and the intelligence of the script by Drew Goddard (Cabin in the Woods, World War Z) is a marvel as to what man has and can accomplish when faced an unfathomable situation. The 3D imagery is spectacular and the special effects are sometimes toned and other times on the scale of a blockbuster big-budget extravaganza. But the film is rooted in the triumph of the human spirit. It's hard not to cheer or cry when we see a balls-out effort to what it takes, to use what it takes, to work tirelessly in what it takes to save one human life. The Martian is destined to be box office hit. Smart, funny, tense and drawing on emotion, it is easily one of the best films of the year and it is the type of film that might just have children once again naming 'astronaut' as the profession that they most aspire to. Yes, it's that good. http://theintestinalfortitude.com/Wrong approach to the book I have read (and loved) the book, and I am not distancing myself from that in this review. There's many ways to adapt material, and in a sense, The Martian is very faithful to the book it is based on. Obviously you can not fit an entire book into a movie, so you would have to skip parts of the plot, etc.. The book the movie is based on is in large parts the astronaut's first hand account of what is going on, the logs he writes. The movies have him making video accounts of the same, so we can hear the character say the lines instead of writing them. All of this makes sense. What I disagree with, was what the movie decided to put its main focus on. It has picked a couple of moments from the book and spent quite a lot of time on them, and fast forwarded through the rest. This has the effect of making Watney's stay "easier" then it is in the book. To me, the book was at its most interesting when Watney was coming up with great solutions, and explaining how he did so. The movie has some of this, but skips most of explanations, choosing to rather "show than tell" (which you'd think be a good thing). That said, I thought they picked great actors to play all of the roles, and all in all I appreciate how close to the book the movie was with what it decided to have on screen. I wish the movie all the best, but would really have preferred if it was done differently. I don't know how, but for this movie I would not have minded an almost continuous voice-over. Or at least for the movie to be longer. Or maybe replace most of the parts without Watney in them, having rather the ongoings on earth being related through other means. I don't know what would work the best, but the direction they went for was a big disappointment to me.Beautiful scenery, a great cast and a down-to-Earth story makes a genuine cinematic experience. The Martian sees Matt Damon play astronaut / botanist Mark Watney as he survives stranded on Mars after an accident during a mission leaves him presumed dead. The Martian is a sci-fi thriller and adventure, showing a return to form for Ridley Scott. This shows space is what he does best. As soon as the film begins you are just immersed by the scenery. Some of the wide shots and the detail put into the setting of Mars is phenomenal. It is honestly stunning and almost makes you think "how did they film on Mars?!". Mars' rich red and stark desert is captured in beautifully composed shots and polished cinematography. The 3D adds a layer of depth that really stood out for me. The cast is spectacular. Great performances all round. Some examples that stood out in particular was Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor and even Kristin Wiig who obviously comes from a comedic background naturally fell into her character and gave a solid performance. But overall this movie would be no where without the leading man Matt Damon who is exceptional. He drives this film. When he's on screen you are with him surviving Mars. When the film cuts back from Mars to Nasa back to Mars to Nasa again it doesn't feel boring or that you like a certain plot better, the film meshes and blends well because these characters and actors deliver stellar performances. Which brings into the writing. The writing is witty, smart and without a doubt hilarious. This movie could have been mopey and very emotion-driven throughout, the film has time to fit in humour here are there and it works! Watney seems to find the funny side in his situations and I had numerous good laughs. I did not expect the film to be this funny and it'll come as a pleasant surprise to people. You are rooting for Watney the entire film. Damon's performance accompanied by witty writing makes for a likable protagonist. The supporting cast elevate the emotion of this event and how it effects everyone and all can relate. Beautiful CGI and directing makes for the aesthetic that is the Mars landscape is really one of the main reasons this movie is so good. A classic and unexpectedly groovy soundtrack too make one of the most entertaining and well-rounded cinema experiences this year. You will be cheering in your seat praying for Watney to make it home!The Martian - a hopeful survivalist tale with a good sense of humour I've always had mixed feelings about Director Ridley Scott and his films. Some are fantastic and some..are not. Here he is back once again to exploring a familiar territory – space. "THE MARTIAN" truly strikes cinematic gold here with what could be looked as a quasi-instruction manual on how to survive surefire death on Mars. Though this adaptation of Andy Weir's novel (which I haven't yet read) is the best thing Scott has given us in quite some time, he still goes where others have gone before – only this time, with a perky, life-affirming attitude. The concept is catchy and simple: While on a mission on Mars, a major storm hits the crew of the Ares III facility causing them to abort and head for their escape rocket. As Commander Lewis (Jessica Chastain), cyber-whiz Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), flight surgeon Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan), pilot Rick Martinez (Michael Pena) and chemist Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie) head out into the vicious winds of Mars where botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit by debris and disappears. The others think he's dead and leave without him. But guess what?! He's alive! And in order to survive he must "science the shite" out of the remaining supplies in a lab that was created to last only 31 days. His wit, scientific know-how and vlogs are what sustain him until the people at NASA – including NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), mission director Dr. Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and flight director Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) – can figure out how to save him. Add in the back ground techies Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis) &amp; Rich Purnell (Donald Glover) who literally come up with the live-saving idea that make it possible to go back and get their man!! All the while they make this trip to Mars almost scenic as you can almost feel the atmosphere while watching. There are shifts here between humor, heart and suspense which are all handled quite well. Plus the soundtrack..ohhh the soundtrack... with it's precise way that it works in the disco from the made-fun-of play-list of Lewis' – with just a sampling is "Waterloo" (ABBA) "Don't Leave Me This Way" (Thelma Houston) and Vicki Sue Robinson's "Turn The Beat Around" – is not only truly ingenious but yes, fabulous as well. It hits all the notes at just the right moment in Watney's journey, giving us a look into his in-the-moment feelings in a perfectly stated way. While this film is almost all Matt Damon, his very adequate supporting cast really gives the film a huge boost..along with the fact that it engages us intellectually, but not over the top as they make it all relatable and with a dose of humour I just loved. So it makes it hard to even list the one small unfortunate thing about THE MARTIAN as it's good..really good.. it does stop just one step short of being electrifying. And in this case..that's still not a bad thing. Grade: Btechnically excellent Ridley Scott has a great eye for fashioning self-contained worlds, evidenced in this movie by convincing depictions of both the confines of a spaceship and the vastness of a planet.  THE MARTIAN is solidly entertaining Hollywood fare. How much you enjoy it will be determined to a large extent on whether you're happy to pass a lot of time watching Matt Damon, who is at the centre of it. He's improved as an actor over the years. Pretty dismal in THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY, he was impressive in BEHIND THE CANDLEABRA, and has some fine moments here. The sheer size of the role might even attract an Oscar nomination. But there's something about him I don't get, a hollowness in him somewhere, a lack which doesn't exist in actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Leonardo DiCaprio, who fill the screen with sheer presence, just as De Niro and Pacino did before them, and Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Spencer Tracy...the list is long. Damon has his moments, more than he used to, but he's not in the same league. Provided you can live with that, and some of the clunky dialogue, you'll have a good time with this technically excellent movie.This film is out of this world... It should be on everyone's must see list for 2015 'Hi, I'm Mark Watney and I'm still alive... obviously.'  Walking into the cinema... Can Ridley Scott redeem himself? This is looking good, but skepticism persists.  Overall Rating: 4.5 stars Cinematic rating: 4.5 stars Bigger questions rating: 4.5 stars  From the opening sequence, it is clear that Mars is a desolate and harsh environment. NASA has sent a manned mission to the red planet, but due to a dangerous storm that will threaten her crew, Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) has to decide to leave the place they have temporarily called home. As they attempt to leave during the storm, one of her crew members, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), is hit by flying debris and thought to be dead. Lewis is left with the difficult choice of saving the rest of the crew or searching for Watney. Her choice is to sacrifice one for the sake of the crew and they leave Mars and Watney behind. The next day, the crew mourn their crewman without knowing that he had survived the storm. Back on Mars, the interstellar botanist has to come to terms with the challenges of being left alone on the lifeless planet with meagre food stores and no direct communication with his team or NASA. Through human ingenuity and the desire to survive, he must find a way to connect with the people who think he is dead with the hope of getting home to Earth.  Ridley Scott (Gladiator) is back in true form with The Martian and it is a reminder of this director's brilliance and what keeps his fans coming back with hopeful anticipation. This space journey incorporates whispers of past survival stories like Apollo 13, Gravity and Castaway, but Scott delivers a fresh perspective on this enduring genre. Whether it is on a remote island or in space, experiencing man's ability to survive and the lengths that their fellow humans will go to see these survivors saved is worth the price of admission. Scott manages to bring together a talent pool of actors that provide the right balance of believable performances and drama to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña, Kristen Wiig and Chiwetel Ejiofor help to lead out a stellar cast that make for a perfect mix of characters, but ultimately, this is Matt Damon's film. His strength of character, unassuming intelligence and dry wit help to drive this story and keep it from turning into an arduous experience. The unwavering belief that he is a botanist and an astronaut provides the needed tenacity, brains and borderline arrogance to make his survival plausible. The trick for the director is to bring the audience along on the journey and make us believe Mark Watney is on Mars and providing enough hope that this space explorer can make it home. Scott manages to balance effective cinematography with a well- crafted script and the right support characters to make this unbelievable tale believable for the audience.  The difficulty in writing a review like this is trying to balance the review with potential drawbacks. The struggle is finding any. The Martian may not appeal to those who need excessive car chases or gun fights to keep their attention and the language is meant for mature audiences, but none of these elements weaken the overall entertainment value. This is an exceptionally compelling ride and should be on the must see list of anyone who enjoys good cinema.  The survival genre is ripe with points of conversation about the human condition. In a film like The Martian, the cost/benefit analysis of saving this one man's life does not make any sense. Saving this one man's life does not seem to justify the expense involved, but it shows how others are willing to risk their physical lives and livelihoods to bring Mark Watney home. Why? Some might say it is the sheer will to live, but it has to go deeper than that, because death is a natural part of life. The answer goes beyond being merely a learnt trait or evolutionary instinct. Mankind seems to be internally wired with a hope for the future. Hope for this life and even something beyond this life. The challenge is considering where this hope originates and how there can be any hope for the future. Is it in science or love of your fellow man or could it be in God? If you were challenged by the film, here is a real challenge, take time to read through Romans in the Bible to see where hope can truly be found for this life and beyond.  Leaving the cinema... On all levels, this is one of the best films of the year. A must see in 2015.  REEL DIALOGUE: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible say about hope? (Jeremiah 29:11, Roman 8:24-25) 2. Why do we care about other's survival? (Matthew 25: 35-40, 1 Peter 3:15) 3. What does this life have to offer? (Ecclesiastes, The gospel of John) Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews #themartianHere's the rub: this is one of the most enjoyable films of 2015. Ridley Scott is truly back to form with this fun, intellectual, charming, well-constructed picture. Admittedly I advent read the book so this review will, unlike others, be of the movie as opposed to an essay on how it contradicts the book or isn't faithful to the source material or whatever.  Matt Damon brings the perfect blend of charm and emotion to this unique character. It's hard to imagine how any human would react in the situation our protagonist Mark Watney is put in - being stranded on a deserted planet 140 million miles away - yet he is able to put in a performance which is heartfelt at times and emotionally driven yet enjoyable and entertaining to observe. The support cast for this flick encompasses overkill in the best way possible. Daniels, Wiig, Ejifor, Bean, Glover, Chastain, Stan... I've undoubtedly left a supreme acting talent out and how sure I am of this is a testament to how many strong performances assured that the audience's interest, when the story was not focusing on Watney's survival, was not squandered. The story is what is promised in the trailer. A male astronaut is stranded on Mars after a mission goes awry and the aftermath regarding how, when and why he should be rescued is the backdrop of the film. Switching between how NASA deals with the situation and how Watney is processing his situation, mixed in with excellent pacing due to brilliant editing and directing allows for a dull moment to be nowhere in sight.  Finding a gripe in this film is difficult. It hits all the right notes and it's charm especially is what will surprise and ultimately please the majority of audiences. The occasional slow moment exists but does not bog down the film by any means. I personally have a slight issue with the final scene but all reviews are subjective and it's highly possible that i'm in the minority in thinking this.  The cinematography and visuals are breathtaking. I would highly recommend seeing this film on the biggest screen possible in 3D. The only thing I can think of being more difficult than NASA actually pulling off a mission such as this would be thinking of someone I couldn't recommend this film to. It ticked all the right boxes and was most definitely one of the most well paced, intellectually stimulating, charming and enjoyable films this year.Potential not reached Non-spoiler review. Having seen an early screening here in the UK, The MARTIAN was one of my most anticipated movies this year. Sci Fi is one of my favourite genres and its great we get a big budget space epic for the 3rd year in a row after Gravity and Interstellar before it. I wasn't a big fan of Ridley's last 2 movies Prometheus and Exodus Gods and Kings, both had great potential but failed to deliver. The MARTIAN unfortunately for me falls into the same zone. It is a better film no doubt than those 2 and the quality of characters /story is much more simpler and coherent but it doesn't reach the full potential I hoped it would. I have read a lot of comments from reviewers before watching it saying the film plays it safe and its clear to the viewer as the film progresses (I haven't read the book). The premise of the plot is straightforward and easy to pick up and it provides the viewer with clear audible dialogue and exposition behind the motives of every action that Matt Damons character undertakes. The science behind the set pieces which form the pillars of the film are accessible to understand for the most part. The visuals are aesthetically pleasing to the eye, especially the terrain of Mars and some shots of the spaceship floating through space, I would say the 3d did enhance these scenes.  However without revealing spoilers, I just didn't become invested in the plot to care enough at the end. The film relies heavily on a formula which is pretty much, problem arises, problem solved, problem arises, problem solved, etc. There are 1 or 2 dues Ex machina moments which come out of the blue simply to drive the plot forward. In this sense the film starts becoming noticeably predictable as it runs its lengthy 2hr 15min course. I felt the dramatic moments on the script should have been focused more on how NASA and the crew debate the ethics of risking 6 astronauts and billions of dollars in space tech against the possibility of saving 1 stranded astronaut 50 million miles away. Overall it's an enjoyable movie, with dry humour and some neat moments throughout illustrated brilliantly by the acting of Matt Damon, but ultimately isn't the thrilling, edge of your seat, tension mounting space epic I was hoping it would be. For me Interstellar is the much better comparison and I would say Gravity is about par if not slightly better than The MARTIAN. Final rating 7/10.Sir Ridley! More gravitas than Gravity! More stellar than Interstellar! After sleeping through Gravity and laughing through Interstellar, (a fine unintentional comedy if ever there was one), it's good to see a contemporary Sci-fi tell the story well - and do the science right. I am not a big Matt Damon fan, mainly because of his loudmouthed lefty nonsense and his limited acting range, but he was very good in this. The support cast were also excellent, especially the always compelling black guy who I can't spell the name of and Harry Dunne. There was some unfortunate pandering by Sir Ridley to the PC brigade, which the film could have done without. The Gen-Y unhygienic (accurate), disorganised, (accurate), disrespectful (accurate), black guy, who also happened to be an astrodynamics genius rocket scientist, (inaccurate), was a poor casting choice. Also to suggest the Chinese would give a fat rat's crack about an American astronaut....at the expense of their state rocket-technology secrets....is laughably far-fetched. Probably more far fetched than flying into space in a roofless/windowless capsule. But putting the film's failings aside, at least Ridley told a good story, laced it with plenty of well-explained science, spliced it with genuine humour and soaked it in amazing vistas of the Martian landscape. Plus he showed that if you put a woman in charge of a dangerous mission, she will ultimately fail. This degree of honesty is refreshing, in an age where every second antagonist is a flimsy female (beating up men ten times her size), or a female weapons expert/assassin/whatever. Show em as they are, Ridley. Well done. All in all a great film where I expected a load of boring tripe. 8/10.The best film I've seen in quite some time! The best film I've seen in quite some time! Which given that so far (admittedly from the limited number of his films I've seen) I'm certainly not classified as 'a Ridley Scott fan', is saying something. A superb film with brilliant characters, excellent acting, a great soundtrack, incredible cinematography, genuinely funny moments and a 2h 20m+ plot that has you hooked throughout and at no point checking your watch! Really difficult to find anything you can fault with this movie! Having seen both films it's inevitably going to be compared to: Gravity &amp; Interstellar, I feel I'm in a position to compare - and on first viewing (watched them all once, and at the cinema) this one knocks the socks off Gravity and encompasses the 'wow' factor of Interstellar but with a much more 'human' plot which is far easier to connect with. I bet the book is a fantastic read, but even without actually reading it I'm guessing this is a really good adaptation which helps bring the pages to life. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to experience what cinema is all about: taking us out of our ordinary lives and whisking us away for 2 hours or so... And realistically who's going to the cinema not wanting that...?very impressive! just got back from an advance screening. Wasn't quite prepared for the ride. I am not a fan of Matt Damon's work on film, but found him very effective as the lost astronaut on Mars who has to survive. I was never bored, frequently on the edge of my seat, and the dialogue was extremely witty. Once the credits rolled and I saw the name "drew goddard" , all the dark and twisted comedic aspects of the film made sense. (Goddard did "the cabin the woods.") This is a real crowd pleaser, with everyone rooting for Matt to come home. Most of us actually clapped at the end of the film. How many movies make you want to do that? The 3D is VERY effective.. I would recommend seeing it in 3d. 9 out of 10. One of Ridley Scott's best efforts.Further proof that Ridley Scott is at his best when doing sci-fi As a genre, sci-fi quite often provides audiences with both thrilling and thought provoking films. Over the past decade there have been some great entries into the genre from filmmakers such as Christopher Nolan and Alfonso Cuaron however, 2015 sees a director return to form in the genre he made his name in. Ridley Scott is responsible for arguably two of the greatest sci-fi films ever made in Alien and Blade Runner, and while Prometheus may not have been a great prequel to the former in 2012, there is no denying that Scott is at his strongest when working within the genre. The Martian is Scott's latest venture into sci-fi and easily his best film in a while. When astronaut David Watney (Matt Damon) is separated from the rest of his crew as a result of a storm during a mission on Mars, he is presumed dead by both his crew and everyone on Earth.  Stranded on Mars all alone, Watney must find a way to survive the harsh conditions of Mars while trying to communicate with NASA in order to get a rescue mission sent his way. What struck me most about The Martian is that, for a film that runs for nearly two and a half hours, it absolutely flies by. Thanks to Scott's direction, a zippy screenplay from Drew Goddard and a superb central performance from Matt Damon, The Martian has an energy running through it that will make sure the audience doesn't lose an interest. Personally, I could have watched another half an hour of it. The film also finds a perfect combination between comedy and drama, which led to a lot more laughs than I thought it would have. It exceeds in both, leading to an interesting take on the human fight for survival and one of 2015's most entertaining films. Coming to the performance of Damon as the stranded Watney, which has to go down as one my favourites of the year so far, and arguably his best performance to date. Damon sells both the tough and vulnerable sides to Watney, remaining totally watchable throughout, which is important as he shares virtually no screen time with any other actor for the whole film. The supporting cast isn't too bad either with Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Aksel Hennie and Chiwetel Ejiofor all playing a part in making The Martian such an engrossing watch.  The cinematography from Dariusz Wolski impressively captures the scope of just how isolated you could be on a vast planet like Mars while also making sure that Damon remains your main focus. There is also some great choices in music for a soundtrack that accompanies the film in such a fun manner. The Martian doesn't reach the high intensity levels of recent sci-fi films such as Gravity or Interstellar but it doesn't have to. For an entertaining slice of sci-fi at the cinema, The Martian is the film for you. I will definitely have to make time to read the novel this is adapted from.Emotionally and viscerally thrilling, this outer space survival story has as much humour and heart as spectacle, and is easily Ridley Scott and Matt Damon's best work in years As tempting as it may be to compare 'The Martian' with 'Interstellar', the two couldn't be more different – and we mean that in a good way. Whereas Christopher Nolan's sci-fi odyssey got (literally) lost in space with its own quantum physics, Ridley Scott's stranded-on-Mars survival story stays rigorously grounded for pretty much its entire duration, relying on hard science and good ol' human ingenuity to pull off a high-concept premise with ambition, derring-do and genuine heart. It is less fiction than fact, but that doesn't stop it from easily being Scott's best film in recent years.  Scripted by Drew Goddard from computer programmer-turned-author Andy Weir's best-selling novel, it chronicles the ensuing days of a NASA botanist named Mark Watney (Matt Damon) in the aftermath of a sandstorm that forces his fellow Ares III crewmates to abort mission and head back to Earth, assuming because of a freak accident that he has been killed. Because his communication equipment has been damaged, Mark's best hope in getting back to Earth is to wait four years for the next manned mission to arrive – that is, if he can survive that long. Mark's challenge is twofold – one, he has to make enough food in order to last 400 sols; and two, he has to drive 3,200 km across Mars terrain to get to the Schiaparelli crater where Ares IV is expected to land. Undaunted, Mark decides to overcome his first by growing his own food, an arduous feat which entails using recycled human waste to make fertiliser and burning hydrazine fuel to create water, in the hope of farming the potatoes meant for the crew's Thanksgiving dinner. As for the latter, well let's just say that the two Rovers which the crew left behind would need to do the trick. Unbeknownst to Mark, NASA is quite aware that he is alive, thanks to an eagle-eyed NASA technician (MacKenzie Davis) who spots activity at the Ares III Hab – though not before the presumed dead astronaut is duly mourned. Leading the rescue mission is the head of NASA Terry Sanders (Jeff Daniels), the team comprising of the head of PR Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig), head of Mars missions Venkat Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor), flight director Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) and director of the Jet Propulsion Lab Bruce Ng (Benedict Wong). It is Venkat who surmises from Mark's movement patterns that he is attempting to use the unmanned Pathfinder lander to communicate with NASA, thereby allowing both parties to have a direct line to each other. Not to give anything away to those who have not read the novel, it suffices to say that a freak accident forces a change of plans to retrieve Mark sooner than previously planned, the eventual rescue effort both an unlikely collaboration between two distrusting world powers as well as a demonstration of the selflessness of Mark's former crew members (played by Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan and Aksel Hennie). Those who have read the book however will notice that Goddard has whittled and condensed some of the details to give the film a leaner but much punchier narrative, and perhaps most significantly, abandoned the use of Mark's video logs which Weir had used in his novel as a framing device. Quite astoundingly though, Scott's film loses none of the intimacy of its source material in portraying Mark's personality and emotional psyche. That is as much credit to Scott's ability to translate Goddard's writing into a spare but effective character study as it is to Damon's warm, sincere and effortlessly winning performance. Much of the movie is held together by Damon and Damon alone, and the actor hits the character beats perfectly with just the right balance of optimism and cynicism to pull off the good dose of wry humour that made Mark such an engaging person in the first place. It isn't difficult to root for someone in Mark's circumstance, but Damon captures his character's hopes, fears, disappointment and helplessness in such a tangible manner that it is hard not to feel an intimate connection with Mark. On that same note, there is also much humanity in the interactions between the staff at NASA headquarters as well as Mark's former crew on board the Hermes spacecraft. It is pleasantly surprisingly that the former is devoid of any political agenda – even a controversial key decision which Terry makes midway into the film is less out of expediency than a genuine concern of the risks involved – and the latter, like we said earlier, proves a rousing display of team spirit. As much as there is spectacle to be had in seeing the execution of a rescue mission of a man on Mars, Scott roots his film in the heart of the people involved in the process, such that the suspenseful climax delivers not just a thrilling send-off but an emotional payoff. Yes, it is pretty much a given that 'The Martian' will boast of Scott's striking visuals, and even with such heightened expectations, the 77-year-old filmmaker doesn't disappoint. Together with his 'Prometheus' cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and production designer Arthur Max, Scott makes the most of the picture's Wadi Rum filming location to create awe-inspiring images of one man against a harsh inhospitable environment, conveying both scale and isolation in breathtakingly elegant frames.  That Scott is still able to astound us with his vision of space is in itself a notable achievement, but 'The Martian' stands out as one of his best films for being much more than spectacle. This is a celebration of the triumph of wits and will against the odds, especially notable in its generous dose of humour and whimsicality. It is also tonally an uncharacteristically upbeat film from Scott, and a befitting shout- out to NASA and the brave men and women who have left our planet to find our place amongst the stars.Excellent film to learn We watch lot of films and read stories about scientists going to other planets for research. I think the way we watch the films and read the stories, it just for thrilling entertainment. We never take the message about how people spend the energy and resources to go to other planets and end up in tragedy and it's all about just surviving with energy and resources we use from earth. We use lot of energy and resources from earth to bring back those people safely to earth. We read stories and watch films like aliens come to earth. Some of the alien life fights against human life. Some of the aliens are very powerful naturally. I am sorry mentioning this. It's our life style to invade all other places for resources. Once we suck resources and destroy the place, we will try to find some other place.Science Porn The Martian quickly begins with the crew aborting their mission and abandoning Mark Watney after being hit by a debris during a storm on Mars, presuming he was dead. And for this impression, this introduction seems sort of contrived, but this film happens to be one of those that gets better and better. As we see this lone astronaut stand up and try to grow plants on this lifeless planet. Everything comes to life when it's just scrutinizing the protagonist's survival on Mars and NASA's rescue mission for him with a delightful dose of science and humor. People might be bragging for more atmosphere of oblivion around this environment, but apparently, it's actually not needed. The upbeat tone of the film is a terrific choice. Not everything has to be a tragedy, The Martian aims to make science look fun and it triumphs from top to bottom. Survival films like this tend to be about self-discovery, life regrets or other personal ordeals, but how this astronaut deals with his own situation is applying his skills; which is botany. So he strategically find ways to grow plants out of potatoes which were stored in their base for food, by collecting soil and fertilizer, even producing water out of chemistry. It's gripping stuff. But the science doesn't stop there; the plot shifts to NASA finding out Watney is still alive and trying to gain contact to rescue him. This rescue plan also consists plenty of scientific strategies; you still won't find any villain in this point, either. Because they're facing the same conflict as the stranded astronaut, which is the probability of failing, even if they carefully planned their ideas. Because every experiment could go wrong, even in something as simple as planting potatoes in a foreign planet. While much of it is discussing their plans and studies, the movie never becomes boring, mostly because it establishes its own personality; especially with its main character. Maybe if the movie is only about Mark Watney surviving on Mars, it would still be a pretty good film, because this character is given a real down-to-earth charisma and Matt Damon justifies all of it. Even when he is just talking for his log explaining his experiments or just driving a rover, it's already a quite entertaining movie to sit through. But having the full story is just equally as important as the Mars alone, because even outside the planet, the other characters are also given enough humor and witty dialogue to make their scientific explanations entertaining to watch. The supporting cast is filled with excellent talents as well that definitely helped making their every moment quite engrossing as Damon's. Of course, the movie doesn't lack impressive visuals, and this merit now comes from Ridley Scott's direction. We've come across with some ambitious space movies in the last two years; either it showcases amazing CGI or amazing practical craftsmanship, but here, those technical methods don't matter. It could be just balance. The simple exterior of Mars already looks impressive in detail, even the scenes in space where how it breathtakingly shoots the interior of the spaceship, it creates an exciting scale of adventure with these angles. There's many to be dazzled here visually, even without acting like an ambitious technical magnum opus. The direction also sharply displays their practicalities which makes every detail easy to comprehend from the fast pace. And the chaotic results of their plan can either be depicted with realism or just a thrilling ride. The Martian's straightforwardness is what made it utterly interesting and supremely entertaining. There is no personal life dilemmas involved in the Mars scenes or any cynical commentary at the NASA side. They're all seeking for the same goal, facing the same problem; they just want the crew to come home. And this doesn't need anything more than their knowledge. Some people might be looking for any sense of humanity in this realm of scientific jargon, and luckily, this movie has plenty of it: isn't Watney's determination of surviving enough? Or his constant sense of humor? How about his loyalty to his crew or everyone's longing of having them return to Earth and reunite with their loved ones; even if the latter is only briefly explained, it's already crystal clear, even without putting up any inspiring monologues or pickup lines. How these characters do their work is already uplifting, anyway. And of course, the soundtrack! Everything else, it's just human beings dealing with nature and time outside their own atmosphere. Their deliberately scrutinized plans are fifty-fifty in this cruel world. It's everything you would ask for in a smart Sci-Fi movie. Its flavor just made it more exciting.A monumental cinematic achievement The year's not over yet but if I were to form a list today, THE MARTIAN most definitely takes the top spot. It's the best movie of 2015 and quite frankly, it's the best Ridley Scott movie since "Gladiator." It's no secret that I found Scott's movies to have been quite disappointing over the past fifteen years or so, "Kingdom Of Heaven," "Body Of Lies," "Robin Hood," "Prometheus" for example — they just existed — they didn't leave a mark nor carry a lot of weight. But I had hope that the director who gave us such classics as "Alien," and "Blade Runner" would return to his form and I find that in THE MARTIAN. Based on Andy Weir's outstanding debut novel and adapted by Drew Goddard ("Cloverfield," "Cabin In The Woods") Oscar winner Matt Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney who's a member of the NASA crew that explores the planet Mars. A storm forces them to leave their mission but a debris hits Watney and he's presumed dead as his fellow crew members leave him behind. But surprise! Wanted survives, he must now figure out how to continue to survive on that desolate planet where nothing grows and his food supplies are dwindling while at the same time figure out how to make contact with NASA. Mark Watney relies on his wit, his botany skills, his courage and his strong determination to get through each day as NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring him home. What's funny about this is that a couple of years ago, Alfonso Cuaron's "Gravity" was also the best movie of that year in my book, and last year, Matt Damon played a character in Christopher Nolan's "Interstellar" that somewhat went through a similar situation as his "The Martian" character, Mark Watney although they're not exact copy. But the point is, THE MARTIAN, at the heart of it, is a survival movie, just like any other survival movies you've seen about one person stranded on some island or some deserted place. What makes THE MARTIAN unique is that it's unlike any other sci-fi movies, mostly because author Andy Weir impressively did his best to make every aspect and every element of this film as accurate as possible. The extensive research is remarkable. In addition to that, the film feels like a series of solving math problem, one after another. Every time there's a glimmer of hope, a problem comes along and complicates the situation again, but it only pushes the characters to brainstorm, to think outside the box and reach out to other help. THE MARTIAN is a monumental cinematic achievement. From the story to the performances to the production design to the VFX, to the editing to every little detail of technical standpoint, everything about this film embodies excellence. It gives us what "Interstellar" could not, because Nolan's movie meant well, but the concept unfortunately trumped its story whereas "The Martian" has them go hand-in-hand. And perhaps some audiences might view this movie as a bit political especially with the scenario of NASA getting assistance from China's space program, but I think anybody from any background could view that as basic morality, the things that we humans could accomplish if we were to focus on a common goal instead of making it be only about a space race. It's amazing that even some smart nerd in Pasadena could bring positive contribution or an idea to the table. The movie is about a collaboration of all these people just to bring one man home, so it's more or it's a much bigger picture than just about Matt Damon's Mark Watney. THE MARTIAN is epic in every sense of the word, it will make you applaud at the end, it deserves a standing ovation. I hope THE MARTIAN would reignite today's generation's interest to once again dream big and look to the skies. Not everybody is going to be an astronaut or work for NASA's plan of someday putting a man on Mars, but personally, I think films like THE MARTIAN, stories such as this, solidify what I've always strongly believed to be true, science is sexy.Ridley: oh dear Ridley Scott has a superb track record and I have seen nearly all of his films.  I read The Martian and eagerly anticipated the movie. A strange disappointment. There is so much that is good (landscapes, the cast, much of the science) but the one thing missing, the key ingredient, is tension. The book achieves that by introducing cloud cover as our hero approaches his destination (bringing battery life to a halt) as well as car crashes, electrical failures, communication breakdowns with Earth and much else. Not in the film.  Why not? Was there so much else which needed to go in? Not really. Earth scenes of NASA arguments, news conferences and cheering were hammed up.  Could do better, Sir Ridley - or was that your last film?Lukewarm fun spaceride on mars Not the best, not what I had expected, and far less than what I had hoped for. Lots of detail missing and lots of dramatic high points omitted making Martian feel like a outta space roadtrip. You never really feel like he is gonna die and even the problems that arise are not given he gravitas they deserve and the solutions that Watney come up with are made to feel like "any average joe" can accomplish it. In reality, what he does is an absolute feat of near future science, engineering and sheer human willpower and ingenuity. As most book to move conversions go, this one is fairly faithful hence the 6/10. I saw The Verge complain about the ending, but comparing the ending of the movie ending to the monologue ending in the book, the book's was far more moving. And the book's ending monologue was used for the promotional material for the movie but not in the movie itself... how dumb! In the end, they left out the almost getting lost in the sandstorm and the rover overturning, two highly tentative moments in the books. One of the most interesting things about the book was the humor and the humor as a result of Mark's comments in his logs, most of which didn't make it into the movie. i.e when he repaired the machine that recycles water and how he does it and the way he interacts with NASA when they tell him don't touch it. (This didn't make it into the movie btw) Its not a bad movie, but it fails to be the great movie it should have been.Decent SF, not a big cinema experience! Went to the cinema today with the highest hope. Movie is a real SF experience. That means a lot of science that is very possible on Mars. And that is the best part of it. It is not a great cinema experience - it's slow, you can anticipate the next move and the end. The main character should be better developed especially in the emotional area. The only strong feelings that you can see are about the food and the disco music. Not a lot of introspection about solitude, anger and fear from death. The story could be a nice TV series where they could develop the story much better and in details. Visually you can really enjoy the red Mars scenery. That part is truly magnificent. Digitally accurate perspectives of the Martian surface are to die for.Not just another space adventure With the novel being already quite famous, The Martian was already surrounded by a good vibe. The movie delivered what exactly the trailer promised. With Ridley Scott in the director's chair hardly few things could go wrong (forget exodus;-)). Narration and screenplay play a major part in this movie. Visual effects are a plus point especially in the climax sequence which is shot to perfection.  The plot is hardly anything more than what is shown in the trailer. Matt Damon gets stranded in mars after a NASA expedition gone wrong. With the crew on another mission, its up to Matt Damon and his intelligence and experience to survive in mars until the rescue arrives. There is a whole lot of tongue in cheek humour in the movie which keeps the audience interested. Though there are a few over the top and cheeky sequences, the screenplay is pretty decent. There is a whole lot of science and biology involved to satisfy the nerd brains. In time to come there might be articles pointing out the scientific inaccuracies but lets face it no science movie can be perfect. The movie does not go overdramatic like other science fiction by trying to introduce an antagonist role when there is no need of one which is the biggest plus point.  The star cast of this film is pretty huge and is bound to attract a huge number of audiences. Many of them get a very little screenspace as expected. Matt Damon appears in a very cool role after a long gap. Chiwetel Ejiofor has a major role and he reminds us of his '2012' performance. Jeff Daniels has nothing much to do apart from keeping a stern face. I felt Jessica Chastain role could have been written better. Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sebastian Stan , Kristen Wiig and Aksel Hennie just increase the star power. Oh and BTW, Sean Bean lives;-) The only downside of the movie is it is a bit lengthy. But the movie is awesome enough to go and have a nice Mars experience.Ridley Scott back on form After delivering space epics like "Alien" and sci-fi classics like "Blade Runner", Ridley Scott is back top of his game in what is his best film since Gladiator and possibly the aforementioned Alien. The Martian is not the film you might expect from Scott, the man who for the better part of the last decade has had films rife with clunkiness. I was amazed at how tonally the film never puts a foot wrong. It's pitch perfect, no pun intended. Everything in the film is juggled and distilled with a precise purpose of how it affects the mood of the piece. Nothing is extraneous. It doesn't compromise any of its many intertwining elements. It doesn't sacrifice its aims for adding humour, suspense, character definition if anything they add to it. The biological, chemical and mathematical elements crucial to the plot are captivating because they're so carefully infused and engrained with this tone Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard have created. It's funny, intense and everything in between because it of how well-crafted the film is. For such an enormous cast, Scott gives them all their moments to shine. It's an ensemble piece in every sense of the word with Matt Damon being the anchor that holds it all together. The soundtrack is the cherry on top. You would really have to go digging, or snark up big time to find problems or flaws. It put a smile on my face that still hasn't left. A wondrous joy. Sublime stuff Mr. Scott. More where that came from, please.  P.S. Never has an Abba track been so elegiac. I never thought I would type those two words in the same sentence.Superb Adaptation of the Novel I saw this last night at its opening. I was stunned by the book, but curious how they would pull off a movie given the book is basically the thoughts of one man stranded on Mars. This is not a story set in the future, but our own present day. We have the technology to send a manned mission to Mars but we lack the political will. Unlike Apollo 13, which bored me to tears, this movie is just captivating. The human interest is beautifully balanced with the technical aspects (many of which have quite rightly been edited out from the over-technical novel). Apollo 13 lost itself in trying to follow the wives' stories, which were all painfully dull. This film sticks to Mark Watney on Mars and the NASA scientists (geeks) trying to bring him home. The characters at NASA are brilliantly portrayed. This is a book written by a geek for geeks, in a world where clever scientists rock, but it also strikes a chord in the heart of anyone who loves storytelling and heroics. As to the cinematography...this will leave you speechless and forgetting it's actually just a movie. Quite wonderful. Do not miss this movie on the big screen.Fun, thrilling and beautifully directed This is a hugely exhilarating, entertaining and captivating film. With top performances from everyone in the stellar ensemble cast, beautiful direction from Ridley Scott, a consistently intense plot and a great sense of humour, this is such an enjoyable movie to watch. So, let's start with the most pleasing part of this film: the fact that Ridley Scott is really back on form. The man who made classics like Alien and Blade Runner should never have lost credibility in the way he has done in recent years thanks to a string of very poor- performing films, but The Martian is a timely reminder why Scott really is one of the all-time greats of directing. The Mars landscape in this film is one of the most beautiful and pristinely shot I've ever seen on the big screen, effortlessly drawing you in and convincing you so well. In effect, this film literally transports you to another world, as this man's terrifying ordeal on a planet millions of miles away from Earth is just so incredibly captivating. Following on from that, the performances here are all very impressive. Matt Damon is fantastic in the central role, brilliantly combining his character's clear fear of the situation as well as his maverick, upbeat attitude to everything, which makes him an absolute joy to watch. Alongside Damon, there is a plethora of A-listers, including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean, Michael Peña and Kate Mara, and all of them are excellent. Everyone puts in an energetic show that corresponds perfectly to this film's brilliant blend of intense emotional drama and hilarious comedy. Seriously, this film is really funny, and although the level of humour never detracts from the intensity of the plot, the fact that there is often such a light-hearted vibe to it all (helped from time to time by a bizarre but oddly perfect 70s soundtrack) makes it such an enjoyable film to watch, adding to the excitement of the story all the more. So, now the story. This is yet another piece of this movie that works sublimely, as the screenplay is filled with fascinating dialogue throughout, and the overall premise of the plot is hugely enticing. Based on Andy Weir's book, the story is always exciting, full of action and genuinely unpredictable suspense. It's said a lot, but this film, more so than anything I can remember in recent years, is totally unpredictable. There is nothing that even gives you a whiff of whether Matt Damon will live or die in the end, and that is massively impressive. Finally, the plot is also filled with great emotional drama. Again, it's not so heavy that the movie loses its fun factor, but it really works well at certain points throughout, bringing incredible poignancy to such an entertaining film.Of Miraculous Science and Sheer Human Ingenuity In truth, The Martian's sentiments may come across as old-fashioned and impossibly conservative. The film's notions subsist in a territory less explored in the ever expanding immensity of the space sci-fiction genre, somehow deviating from the category's more standardized form, but it makes a clear point, one that strongly testifies to humanity's incredible capacity to survive. The hero is Matt Damon's Mark Watney, who, after presumed dead by the rest of NASA's Ares 3 crew, was left in Mars, alone in the hostile red planet. He has at least four years to endure before a possible rescue mission arrives. But with limited rations left that may be good for only a few months, and persistent fatal conditions around him ever present, the witty Watney decides to "science the sh!t out of it" for him to survive, declaring he is the planet's greatest botanist, after all. For most of his chunk of the screen time, Watney shares his daily struggle in seemingly endless monologues through a confessional Vlog, running through diverse subjects that go from things as random and simple as Donna Summers to those of unfathomable scientific and mathematical depths, like thermodynamics and hexadecimals. And if you're not really into such stuff, you would thank him for throwing punchlines every now and then, which sometimes may be corny and flat, but nonetheless enough to keep us away from getting bored. And with the rest of the cast mostly standing in front of screens monitoring him,y Damon singularly shines throughout the picture. That's not to say the rest of the frame is invaluable, but Watney's struggle itself creates an emotional connection between the worlds, relaying a cathartic sentiment that the audience would impossibly not relate to. This may not be your no.1 sci-fi film, no thanks to a not- so- impressive finale, a bunch of supports whose functions mostly never go past just being stare-at-the- monitor standees, and some persistent logical leaps in the narrative, but it should be enough to shake up your list. Not only it pays with utmost reverence to science, it also explores its endless possibilities, which may not be within our grasp at the moment, but still scientifically possible. With all that said, 'The Martian' is an exquisite cinematic gem, its sentiments reminiscent of familiar campaigns pulled off by countless previous films aiming to enforce humanity and its miraculous capacity. It's a celebration of human spirit and our species' ingenuity. And while everybody's abuzz about the recent discovery of existence of water in the red planet and the possibility it might be capable of supporting life, 'The Martian' has somehow delivered a compelling argument about how the planet probably can, one I believe, is worth checking out.It's hard to imagine Ridley Scott directing a film like this one.... Ridley Scott is famous for bringing "Alien" and "Bladerunner" to the big screen. Both have huge followings and both are amazing for their time when they were made. Now with "The Martian" he brings a great sci-fi film to us but one with an entirely different mood--so much so that it's hard to believe it's from this famed filmmaker! Why? Because the mood is so much more positive and upbeat--and it's a film that leaves you happy...something you could never say about the other movies! As far as what I liked about the film and what I disliked, I'll make it easy--especially since there are already so many reviews for the movie. What I liked was everything and I hated nothing. There is nothing I would have done differently...and that's something I almost never can say. This is a very intelligent, crowd-pleasing quality picture from start to finish and you should see it on the big screen if you can. Yes, it's THAT good!Technically Great and a Wonderful Performance by Damon The Martian (2015) *** 1/2 (out of 4)  On a mission to Mars a crew of astronauts get caught in a brutal storm when one member, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit with an object and apparently killed. The commander in charge (Jessica Chastain) decide to leave the planet and NASA must announce that Watney has been killed but soon they all discover that he survived. Now Watney must find a way to try and survive on the planet with a lack of food and water. Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN is an extremely entertaining movie and it's easy to see why it became such a box office hit. The idea of a man being trapped on a different planet and having to decide whether he wants to live or die is such a simple idea and there's no question that Scott knows how to handle drama and tension in space. The film has a very good story to draw you in but I'm not going to lie and say I didn't have any problems with the movie but more on that in a bit. A lot of credit certainly goes to Scott who handles the material extremely well and most importantly is the fact that he makes you believe that this man is actually trapped on Mars. If the viewer thought they were just looking at a set or just some fake CGI then it would pretty much kill the story. By Scott creating a real environment you have no problem believing that you're seeing a man trapped on a planet with his closest help millions of miles away. On a technical level the film contains some wonderful cinematography, a great and rousing score and of course brilliant sound effects and set designs. Damon's excellent performance is another very important factor because we need an actor who we're not only going to believe in the part of a brilliant astronaut but we also must be entertained by him and care for him. Damon certainly makes you believe that he's this brilliant mind and there's no question that his one-man-show is something the actor nails. We get a strong group of supporting players including a very good Chastain plus strong work from Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Donald Glover and Chiwetel Ejiofor. As I said, I did have some major problems with the film including the fact that it just seems like everything happened way too easily. I understand this is a mainstream movie that couldn't get into great detail because it might confuse or bore the viewer but I just thought the film would have worked even better had it been more realistic. Of course, I'm no space expert so perhaps what happens here is 100% believable. I'd also say that the film is also a tad bit too predictable. Either way, THE MARTIAN is certainly a very good movie.Tasks for your survival Although The Martian is set in an indeterminate future I have questions about labeling it science fiction. One of the film's best strengths is that it is based on what we know about the landscape and atmosphere of Mars right at this point in time. It's a desert planet with water and no life as we know it. Compared to what Matt Damon has to go through, Robinson Crusoe was on that tropical isle for a picnic. They never really say just exactly what year The Martian is set in. The film in that sense avoids a trap like so many others fall into. Just this past year we saw 2015 come and go and it wasn't really anything like the 2015 that Marty McFly experienced. That's just one example. Of course you can also never predict what popular trends will be there. That's purely speculative. So you can't have Matt Damon's character listening to current music. His captain's taste in music was 70s disco and that really became a running joke. It's all he heard for the months he was on Mars. Personally I'd prefer a selection of 30s and 40s music with Bing Crosby at the top of my list. But if that's all I heard for months on end, I'd grow to hate Der Bingle.  And that's part of the story, the everlasting boredom trying to keep your mind fresh and busy with tasks for your survival. Like Mr. Roberts from tedium to apathy and always boredom. What happens in The Martian is that Damon is part of an astronaut team and gets left behind when a Martian sand storm erupts and the crew flees on the space ship. Captain Jessica Chastain takes when she thinks Damon was killed.  The future also brings us better communication and NASA learns that Matt's still there. To say that there's a public relations problem is putting it mildly. Just leaving him there is actually an option discussed. But that goes against the code of a decent civilization which while we're not at Star Trek level yet, we look to be heading that way. Although The Martian splits time evenly with Damon's plight and the efforts to rescue him, Matt's time alone on the screen with the full range of emotions displayed is what got him his Best Actor nomination. Besides the realistic depiction of Mars, his performance is the other pillar on which this fine film rests. I would give mention to Jessica Chastain and her fine performance as a tough and yet humane leader of her team. Besides Matt Damon, The Martian is also up for Best Picture and for a flock of awards in the technical categories. It should take home deserved statues this year.fun thrilling space adventure The Ares III manned mission encounters a sand storm on Mars. Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left for dead as the rest of the crew evacuate on their spacecraft. Mission control back on Earth is shocked when they discover that Mark is actually alive and alone on Mars. Simply put, this is a fun space adventure. There is a good deal of Apollo 13 and Gravity. Damon is humorous and engaging. Meanwhile, the mission control back on earth is doing interesting things. Nobody is the villain. Jeff Daniels is a capable bureaucratic leader. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives the team intensity and has fun scenes with Mackenzie Davis. Almost every side character adds to the group. As for the spacecraft, it's interesting to have Jessica Chastain as the commander. The entire cast is great. The whole story is thrilling. There are unexpected turns. It has the feel of reality. A lot of praise has to be given to director Ridley Scott for a well constructed film. Also it's genius to give it a disco soundtrack.Entertaining and slick enough to make you go with it I heard a lot about this film regarding its scientific validity as a piece of fiction. Perhaps as a result of this I assumed that the film would be a dry affair – an impression sort of confirmed by the longer than normal running time. As it happens, this is not the case at all because The Martian has much more in common with the entertaining blockbuster that the starry cast list and presentation suggest it will be. The story wears its science very much on its sleeve, but yet makes it accessible and fun – with the slick presentation making it so. As a result everything seems to be explained with everyday objects, and even the most complex principles are presented in simple terms (references to Iron Man for instance). As a result the film gets to have its cake and eat it – although the film is helped by the knowledge of a lot of this being possible (eg hitting a point near Pluto recently with very tight tolerances on a journey of years). The film itself doesn't really play up the drama in a heavy way, but rather does enough to invest the viewer in it without making it too much of a downer or serious. The soundtrack is hugely upbeat, the content is mostly light in tone, and the science is delivered in a very user-friendly fashion – essentially in the service of the tone and the entertainment value, nothing more than this. The starry cast add to this feeling, and use their screen presence well. Damon is consistently likable, which is just as well since he is alone in the vast majority of his scenes. The ensemble cast has a lot of depth to it, all of which are solidly watchable – Chastain, Wiig, Daniels, Eiofor, Peña, Bean, and so on. The Chinese aspects of the plot serves as another reminder that this film is a blockbuster out to make money, but it doesn't seem too out of place. Technically it looks great and it impressive how convincing the surface of Mars looks. In the end we get to the fist-pumping mission control scenes that we all knew were coming, but along the way the film is slickly packaged and entertaining as a result; even if the oft-mentioned scientific validity of it all is not something it ever seems concerned with itself.Total Lack of Emotion and Suspense During a storm in Mars, the astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit by an antenna and presumed dead by his captain and crew that cannot find him. Captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) seeks him out and decides to departure with her crew. However, he has survived and finds that was left behind short of supplies and without communication to Earth. Mark is botanic and uses his knowledge to plant potatoes in a green house he has prepared. Meanwhile in NASA the scientists find that Mark is alive and try at any cost to bring him back to Earth. Will they succeed? "The Martian" is a film with fantastic special effects and cinematography. However there is a total lack of emotions and suspense and it is hard to understand the hype around this film. Mark Watney seems to be a combination of Robinson Crusoe with MacGyver with his ideas and solutions. However, he never feels depressed or in despair with the loneliness or with his doomed situation. His rescue is a rip-off "Gravity" that is better and better. If the viewer watches this movie with great expectation, he or she will be very disappointed. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "Perdido em Marte" ("Lost in Mars")Quite Possibly the Best of 2015 During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Although at this point I have only seen three of the eight Best Picture nominees, I feel confident in saying that "The Martian" deserves to win. Although Ridley Scott is not nominated for Best Director (odd considering this is his best film in a long time or possibly ever), and the only acting nomination is for Matt Damon (who will likely lose to Leonardo DiCaprio)... this movie nails it on the story alone. By all means, this can win in the Best Adapted Screenplay category, as well. No, I have not read the original book so I do not know what Drew Goddard put into it. And no, I have not seen all the other nominees yet. I suspect "Big Short" is also an excellent script. But again, this film succeeds based on two things: incredible suspense and a strong script. Is all the science strictly accurate? No. Apparently some key things, such as the "fierce storm", are not correct. But we believe it. Everyone speaks as though they know what they say, and unlike "Star Wars" (or even "Star Trek") this is clearly based on reality. In recent years, it seems that a space movie somehow sneaks into the top Academy nominees. After "Gravity" and "Interstellar", we have this. And I dare say they are getting better. "Gravity" was a good exploration of visuals, but not a deep film. "Interstellar" took everything to the next level, even to the point of being a mind-bender. Here, I think we have the perfect balance: hard science and space danger. What could have been two hours of boring, bland scenes of a man in a desert end up being exciting and you can feel the desperation -- and more importantly the endless optimism and hope. The bulk of the film's nominations are in production design, sound and other effects. These are well-deserved, and it may take home a few. Not being an expert, it is hard to judge sound editing. But this is the sort of movie where such a thing can make or break the picture. There will be some strong competition, but the designs of the NASA equipment are impressive and the sounds are excellent. The visual effects are a harder sell, with some of the low-gravity moments seeming a bit off somehow. The takeaway: expect a win or two in the technical categories. Of the bigger awards, Damon is a contender for Best Actor but will not win. Best Adapted Screenplay ought to be a lock, and if it gets nothing else this is the film's strong suit. For my money, "The Martian" has Best Picture written all over it, but the experts are leaning more towards "The Revenant" or "Spotlight"... on that, we will have to agree to disagree.Fun but Far From Great This is certainly an entertaining film as a formula movie. It's fun like the earlier "Independence Day" film with Bill Pullman and Will Smith. We put a poor guy in an untenable situation, trapped on a planet when his colleagues are forced to take off and leave him behind. As a scientist, he does miraculous things to stay alive, including creating a greenhouse where he can grow potatoes (that just happen to be on board providing seed). That's OK. That's a plot element. He also has incredible knowledge of all the incredible stuff left behind on Mars. An amazing rover as well as a nuclear device. That's OK too because we can't have a plot without something for this guy to do. Where it falls down is in the reality of NASA (which we are told are a pack of insensitive boobs or nerds). They are going to do this and then they are going to do that. Jeff Daniels plays a stuck-in-the-mud guy who is only concerned about the politics of the job. I love Matt Damon. I've seen nearly everything he has done. He's adequate in this film but certainly not Academy Award material. He expresses almost no emotions other than a couple little under-control tantrums. What about the loneliness, the sameness of every day? Years of eating potatoes. Anyway, it is candy for those who don't want to think very much. It's very impresstive looking and the special effects are awesome. We've become a bit spoiled, I guess. Things by the formula.An Intelligent Space Thriller These stories of isolated individuals -- "Castaway", "Robinson Crusoe," "Jeremiah Johnson" -- can be difficult to pull off. They can turn banal in a hurry. Poor Thoreau couldn't do a satisfactory job. "First, I felled the small fir, then adzed the bark and trimmed the mesophyllum into rabbits for the lallies."  "The Martian" pulls it off with aplomb, helped greatly by a courageously demanding script from screenwriter Drew Goddard. A cornucopia of plaudits to the guy, and to Ridley Scott for doing a fine job with the direction, and to the performers who are all at the top of their game, especially Chiwetel Ejiofor as a member of the team back on planet earth. The climax is about as tense as it gets. The musical score, alas, is generic. The story is pretty well-known by now. Matt Damon is a botanist, part of an exploratory team on Mars, who gets accidentally left behind. He sets about providing a habitat for himself, much in the manner of a test pilot who has run into troubles. As Chuck Yeager has pointed out, the pilot in distress doesn't panic. He just asks, "What do I do next?" It may sound a little boring but it's not. Damon's Martian doesn't despair. He describes exactly what he's doing to a video recording he intends to leave behind as a record if he dies. We are the video recording device. He's pretty chipper throughout. An experiment goes awry and he presents his injured face to the device and says, "Okay. I blew myself up."  About a third of the movie deals with the team back on earth and with the crew of the Hermes, the space craft that left Damon behind. The commander of the Hermes is Jessica Chastain, whom I admire a great deal. It's not just that she's attractive because she's less like a typical Hollywood glamour queen and more like the pretty women ahead of you in the supermarket checkout line. She has a strong jaw but her pale presence suggests fragility, as if one of her long bones might break if she slipped and fell down. I grovel in wonderment at her nose. It assumes a normal tangent from the plane of her face but at its very tip it forms an impudent little outward projection. Speaking of tangents, that reminds me. Some viewers might find the dialog a little challenging -- velocity in so many meters per second, escape acceleration, "sols" instead of days, Schroedinger's cats or whatever. It didn't bother me a bit. It all sailed completely over my head in the most satisfying way.The Martian From BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Sir Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Prometheus), this cleverly titled space film I debated seeing at first, having average reviews, but I went for it. Basically a temporary artificial habitat called The Hub has been established on the planet Mars by the crew of the manned mission Ares III, they are to stay for 2 months and return to Earth in their orbital probe. However, 6 days into the mission the base is hit by a massive Martian storm and they are forced to abandon and launch themselves, to avoid the escape vehicle collapsing and leaving them stranded. While evacuating, astronaut Mark Watney (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Matt Damon) is hit by a large piece of debris and disappears into the rushing planet dust, he is presumed dead as his biomonitor is damaged, mission commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and the rest of the crew with their lives at stake are forced to leave Mars. Watney has in fact survived the storm and makes it back to the Hab, but he is unable to contact NASA, he calculates that he has 300 days of food, uses his knowledge as a botanist to make a makeshift farm in the central room of the habitat, and anticipates needing to survive at least three years before a return mission to the planet takes place. Mark makes video logs to keep up morale and plans to journey to the landing site of Ares IV, he modifies the rover for capability to travel long journeys. Satellite photos of Mars are received at NASA, engineers Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis) realise Mark is alive, they immediately attempt to establish contact, against the decisions of the Hermes spacecraft flight director Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean), NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) orders that the crew of Ares III, currently travelling back to Earth, are not told. Back on the surface of Mars, Mark finds defunct probe the Pathfinder, he uses it to regain contact with Earth, using the probe camera and signs for a letter coding system, later on Mark establishes real-time text messaging from NASA in the modified rover. As Mark continues to grow his crops, a plan is formulated by crew supervisor Mitch Henderson and JPL director Bruce Ng (Sunshine's Benedict Wong) to send a space probe to Mars to resupply Mark to last up to four years until Ares IV can reach him, Sanders speaks to the press about the discovery of Mark living on the planet, and he authorises Henderson to send a video message to the crew to tell that Watney is alive. But probe inspections are skipped and it explodes during launch, Mark meanwhile suffers his own disaster as the airlock on the habitat malfunctions, it explosively decompresses, his crops are killed, his projected food supply is reduced and he resorts to strict rationing. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) offer NASA a lifeline, a classified booster can carry a payload, this can be sent to Mars to resupply Mark, or resupply the Hermes so that the Ares III can return to the planet and rescue Mark, Lewis and her crew agree to force Sanders to go ahead with the second option, by setting their craft into a gravitational slingshot back to Mars, the resupply mission is successful and the crew begin the return journey. Seven months later, Mark has driven all key life support systems to the Ares IV mission base, he strips down the Area IV launch vehicle (placed on Mars in advance) to save weight, following instructions from Kapoor, his spacesuit will be used to protect against the vacuum of space. The Hermes reach and orbit Mars, the Ares IV is launched remotely, but Mark's vehicle fails to achieve the altitude needed to be intercepted, an explosive device rupturing an airlock to release the ship's atmosphere and generate thrust is improvised to slow the Hermes down without wasting fuel, still too far away Mark makes the drastic decision to pierce his suit hand and use the suit's pressure to come close enough for Lewis to catch him. In the end Mark returns to Earth to begin "day one" of his new life as a NASA safety instructor for new candidates to the astronaut training program, and the crew members watch the news of the successful launch of Ares V. Also starring Kristen Wiig as Annie Montrose, Michael Peña as Rick Martinez, 127 Hours' Kate Mara as Beth Johanssen, Sebastian Stan as Chris Beck, Aksel Hennie as Alex Vogel and Donald Glover as Rich Purnell. Damon as the man trapped on the red planet is a great amiable character, making wisecracks to himself along the way, you definitely want him to be rescued, and there is great support from Chastain, Daniels and Ejifor. If you were to describe this, you could plonk together Cast Away and Apollo 13, but there is a film titled Robinson Crusoe on Mars you could mention as well. What is really good about this film is the choice of music throughout, the lead character is forced to listen to disco tunes, and the choices of songs used are inspired, including "Hot Stuff" - Donna Summer, "Waterloo" - ABBA, "Starman" - David Bowie, and the genius choice is "I Will Survive" - Gloria Gaynor. The first half of the film is really effective with the man, the "martian" of the title (no aliens are ever seen), desperate to survive working for his needs, the middle trails a little with scientific gibberish, but it picks by the last half an hour with the crucial rescue, overall it is a worthwhile science-fiction drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects. Good!a thoughtful, exciting, crowd-pleasing movie about problem-solving It's great to see characters think and actively searching for a solution to a problem. That was one of the driving forces of Apollo 13 (remember, "fit that, with that, using nothing but that"), and other films dealing with survival often have that as a crux of the narrative. But The Martian isn't something where the filmmakers are trying to do a lot with a little dialog, like All is Lost or Cast Away. There are stretches without talking, but not as many as you'd expect; as the audience we're filled in often about what processes are going on and how things keep evolving (or, sometimes, breaking down miserably) in the search for how to keep astronaut/Botanist Mark Watley a) alive and b) bring him back home. It is a splendid piece of big, mainstream entertainment because it really digs in in ways that invite the audience in, while constantly keeping things entertaining and amusing. The Martian is about a man left behind by his crew (not their fault, they genuinely thought he was a goner), and how he has to find ways to stay alive, to give himself food and, most importantly, send word to NASA that he's alive and well and can they maybe send some supplies and oh does the crew know yet? It's got a lot of science to it - as Damon says in the trailer that most have seen, "I'm going to have to science the s*** out of this" - but, more often than not, it's accessible and easy enough to understand. That is, of course, if you're not too scared by science fiction (or, as the filmmaker and actors have talked about in press interviews, science 'fact', as everything, save for us presently going to the moon with men/women on a ship, is plausible).  It's a movie about how to keep humanity in all its dimensions going through the perils of space. And, as we see, space is nothing if not indifferent; it acts, particularly on Mars, as a place where nothing really grows, storms can knock the hell out of things if items or persons aren't fastened tight, and if anything comes loose, watch out for the air and pressure to possibly kill you. On the level of threats, director Ridley Scott and especially screenwriter Drew Goddard (taking, from what I've been told, faithfully from Andy Weir's best-seller), it's high and pretty constant, and there is always that sense even when things are going well that they can break down at any time. While I never thought watching it 'Oh, maybe he won't get back or might die', as the conclusion seems clear since we are meant to like this guy and want to see him live/return, the threats and obstacles are presented expertly, with a lot of excellent pacing giving us breathing room. The 'breathing room' part is what I mean by this being a crowd- pleasing, entertaining flick. Goddard, previously of Cabin in the Woods, is adept at giving actors funny things to say, and The Martian is just good but basic sci-fi without the wit. Some of it may seem obvious - Watley is saddled with one of the other astronauts' musical selection (disco, which he grows to kind of like in a begrudging sort of way) - but a lot of it is due to personality, from him as well as those at mission control (Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, a very funny Donald Glover, Jessica Chastain and Kate Mara are part of what is actually a giant supporting cast). These are serious scientists and people trying to do their jobs in (mostly) responsible ways, but how they talk is closer to how one might see people talk in, say, the real world; this isn't the tone-deaf wit of Prometheus, and it's funnier than what Gravity previously tried to do. I was surprised how much I was laughing during The Martian. But it's deep down a drama, and led by Matt Damon in a performance that makes this director-writer-actor triangle complete for the audience. He has to hold down major chunks of the film, albeit there is a lot with NASA and the other ship with Chastain and so on, and without making this man believable in his serious scientific intellect, his ways of making things light (or cursing, which is interesting that they get away with a PG-13 here by the way through bleeps), and real pathos, the movie won't work, or nearly as well. He delivers up to what the script asks, and it, plus Scott's visual scope and control of the pacing, make this an exceptional Hollywood movie. We get to see how process works in a crisis, and that's always character-building and interesting (when written well) in a movie; that it's at this level of A-list makes The Martian a special film, and one of Scott's best.Stranded on Mars Set in the not too distant future the Ares III mission to Mars has to abort there 31 Sol (Martian day) mission on Sol 18 when a storm hits their base and threatens to topple the rocket that will take them back to the Hermes, the craft that will take them back to Earth. As they run through the storm a piece of debris hits mission botanist Mark Watney. His colleagues try to find him but as his suit's telemetry suggests he is dead they are forced to leave without him. It soon emerges that he is not dead unfortunately he calculates that there won't be enough food left for him to survive till the next mission to Mars. Back on Earth everybody thinks he is dead until a satellite photograph shows that the Ares III site has changed so somebody must be there! Still at this point there is no way to contact him. Mark manages to grow potatoes for food and sets about retrieving a transmitter from a previous mission. With contact finally made they start discuss how he might be rescued. Time will be close and there will be setbacks. Fans of 'Hard Sci-Fi' should really enjoy this; the idea of manned mission to Mars might seem many years away the technology we see doesn't seem unrealistic and the story seemed plausible so much so that the film this most reminded me of was 'Apollo 13' which was of course based on a real life near disaster in space. The opening set up is effective and wastes little time in stranding Mark on Mars then we get down to the business of him trying to figure out how to survive. He encounters many problems which are resolved logically. Similarly the events on earth appear plausible as first those in charge want to avoid a PR disaster then work to rescue him when it becomes apparent that he is alive. The cast does a fine job. Matt Damen excels as Mark Watney managing to be entertaining even when the only talking he does for much of the time is direct to camera as he records a video diary. The rest of the cast, which includes many familiar faces also impresses. The Jordanian locations used look suitably barren to act as a substitute for Mars. While things are serious for the most part there are some good laughs as well; many provided by the fact that the only music Mark has is some disco taken to Mars my the mission commander this provides an excuse for some enjoyably incongruous back ground music which I rather enjoyed. Overall I really enjoyed this and would certainly recommend it even if you don't consider yourself a sci-fi fan."Who am I to talk about loneliness?" As improbable as the story is, it had a certain resonance to my mind about the capacity of the human spirit to persevere and make the best of one's circumstances under the most intolerable of conditions. Faced with the same situation, how many would simply give up and let fate take it's course? The harder thing to do is stretch one's mind and resources in an effort to stay alive and operate from a position of informed intelligence until help arrives. When Mark Watney (Matt Damon) proclaims "I'm not gonna die here", not only do you believe it but you wish there was something you could do to help. That's not to say I didn't find some elements to be just too unbelievable. The real time communication with the rescue team, and especially the sharing of Watney's comments with the rest of the world defied any sort of credibility. China helping pro-actively - I don't think so, at least not in an official capacity. The cracking wise dialog of the crew members was also a little too forced it seemed. You would think there would be some consternation over the plight of the stranded team member. But for a sci-fi film offering a once in a lifetime what if scenario, the picture works well enough to be an entertaining diversion. I can think of worse ways to spend a couple of hours.The Gardener out of space It's almost impossible to not have seen at least glimpses/clips from this movie. But just knowing what this will be about, does not mean you won't enjoy the ride. It may be true with some other movies, but this works quite good. Even though we do know more and are expecting the inciting incident to happen to Matt Damons character. And while everyone else does not know about him and his status, we do know. And I think everyone can at least relate to some parts, when it comes to feeling lonely. Even someone who has a lot of people around him/her, has moments where you only have yourself (to rely upon). And Damon has a lot to do. You could say this is predictable (and maybe has an agenda, depending on the outcome always), but the tension still never lets up. Entertaining and funny too, even when Damon breaks a couple of rules of filmmaking (not talking to oneself, but then again, what else can you do? Plus he's not "just" talking to himself ... well you'll see).Help is only 140 million miles away. For Mark Watney, stranded on Mars. We viewed this on DVD from our public library. Picture and sound are first-rate. The premise is somewhere in the 2030s we have advanced our space exploration to successful missions to Mars. While one is underway a large, unforecast storm comes up on Mars requiring the crew of 6 to cut the mission short and use the escape rocket to blast off and rendezvous with the main space ship orbiting Mars. But one of the crew, Mark Watney, is hit by a large object and carried away, injured and out of communications. Reluctantly they have to blast off without him after a short search was futile. Mark was presumed dead. But Matt Damon as Mark Watney didn't give up so easily, he managed to get himself to a base station and using medical tools and staples repaired his wounds and set about trying to figure out how to survive with limited resources. Fortunately with rations for 6 he was able to make food stretch, and as a Botanist even came up with a method to make water and, using his own waste as fertilizer, used a Thanksgiving package of potatoes to grow potatoes in a chamber converted to a greenhouse of sorts. So much of the movie is about Mark's survival, plus his figuring out a way, using old abandoned Mars exploration robots, to communicate with NASA. The real hard part becomes how to plan and carry out a rescue mission. Mars is far away, it takes a long time, he has limited time to survive. The cast is varied and good, with Jessica Chastain as Melissa Lewis, the commander of the mission. Kristen Wiig in a serious role as a NASA communications officer, Jeff Daniels as Teddy Sanders, the NASA chief, Michael Peña as Rick Martinez, the pilot for the mission, Kate Mara as one of the crew, a computer expert, Beth Johanssen, among others. This is a really good and entertaining movie. It is a serious subject but is treated with appropriate humor.  EDIT: I re-watched it 8 days later and enjoyed it as much the second time! SPOILERS: When the first rescue approach failed in a faulty rocket launch, a young data nerd calculated, using NASA's super computer, that the crew on their way back to Earth could accelerate and using the Earth slingshot return to Mars, but it would require a risky capture of a re-supply module and a never-rehearsed module take-off from Mars to try to capture Watney in a Mars fly-by. NASA said no to the risk but the crew decided on their own to try the rescue. That whole last scene was very tense and of course it was a success.Surviving the loneliness of Mars. Not the most overwhelming thing from director Ridley Scott, but not exactly underwhelming. Commend Drew Goddard for putting Andy Weir's book way out there. Mark Watney (Matt Damon)is an astronaut and superior botanist that finds himself abandoned on the surface of Mars after his crew concludes that he perished in a major dust storm. Watney with his intellect and humor must find a way to survive the harsh planet. His former crew is high-tailing it back to Earth and is not told my NASA command that Watney is planting/growing potatoes and producing water for sustenance. NASA administrator Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) is too embarrassed and ashamed at first to tell the world that the astronaut has been discovered alive by astrodynamics nerd Rich Purnell (Donald Glover) and has convinced space scientist Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) that a rescue is very possible with some major help of international scientists, especially the Chinese space program that has the perfect rocket to get the Herculean effort underway. After being told, his original mission colleagues led by commanding officer Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) are more than ready and able to join in the rescue watched around the world. This film is held together with a soundtrack a bit better than astronaut Watney prefers. Music by the likes of Donna Summer, Abba, The O'Jays, The Hues Corporation, David Bowie and Gloria Gaynor's anthem "I Will Survive". Other cast members featured: Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Mackensie Davis, Askel Hennie, Sean Bean and Kate Mara.Not Brilliant And Not A Musical While exploring Mars an expedition get caught up in a sandstorm and have to beat a hasty retreat leaving behind the body of a dead team member . As it transpires he isn't dead but soon will be as it'll take too long to mount a rescue mission and his supplies will have run out long before then  A return to form from acclaimed director Ridley Scott . Oh hold on I'll use quotation marks because that's not really my opinion "A return to form from acclaimed director Ridley Scott" . I'm afraid I found this rather boring . Matt Damon finds himself trapped on Mars struggling to survive . Early in the film Matt takes off his spacesuit and glancing at his inhuman well buffed torso you know every hetrosexual woman on the planet will want to use him as their own personal lick toy if he makes it back to Earth . Remind me and 3.5 billion other mortal men why we want him to survive this ordeal ?  I'm afraid I'd forgotten his characters name because my disbelief was never suspended long or hard enough to think I was watching a real life character trying to survive a real life situation but more of an actor appearing in a Hollywood movie . "Luckily I'm a botanist so I can grow things" he states. Wow , how fortunate is that ? Very fortunate I'd say and this type of good fortune reminds you you're watching a contrived story . It does try and bring science fact to the narrative but at the same time when you've got the actor who played Boromir in THE LORD OF THE RINGS explain why the rescue mission is called "Operation Elrond" this tends to underline the fact that you're watching a movie  One puzzling thing is that it's picked up several Golden Globe nominations - in the comedy/musical category ? This is ridiculous since the film is in no way a comedy or a musical . Its style is somewhat reminiscent of these films in the 1980s with either a diegetic or non diegetic musical soundtrack blasting away . Anyone consider APOCALYPSE NOW a musical ? I didn't think so . That said I did slightly respect THE MARTIAN more than the rather overrated INTERSTELLAR . It's just that when you compare it the breathtaking achievement of GRAVITY a couple of years ago or the thematically similar THE REVENANT then you'll probably find THE MARTIAN a bit lacklustre in comparison . I also think because of voter politics - Inarritu won best director at the Oscars last year - the Academy Awards might just give Ridley Scott a long overdue Oscar in 2016 , but to be honest he's made better films than this oneA Great Story Of Hope And Optimism Matt Damon stars in this science fiction film that tells the story of an astronaut that was mistakenly presumed to be dead and left behind in the planet Mars entitled The Martian.This film directed by Ridley Scott is based on Andy Weir's novel of the same name.Joining Damon in an ensemble cast are Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Donald Glover and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Astronaut Mark Watney is part of a NASA manned mission.After a fierce storm,the mission presumed him dead and left him behind after he was presumed to be dead.But with strong will,he managed to survive and finds himself alone on planet Mars.Learning of his circumstances particularly the meager supplies available to him,he draws upon his intelligence and wit to find a way to signal on earth and ask them to send a rescue mission to save him.Faced with the impossible task and with the world informed about his predicament,the rescue mission is cheered upon by many people to conduct this impossible task of bringing Watney safely. This is a wonderfully made movie.Ridley Scott and Matt Damon did well as director and actor respectively especially the latter who probably had one of the best performances that he has ever had in his career.The story of hope and optimism will truly inspire the viewer especially in these tough and challenging times around the world.Added to the theme of the triumph of the human spirit,it was also fun to see a great mixture of science,intelligence and humor into the movie particularly in main character.Definitely a must-see feel good movie.The man on Mars Ridley Scott's The Martian was wonderfully realised on 3D for the big cinema screen. It probably will not come across well on the small screen. Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is separated from his spacecraft and crew on a mission to Mars. Instead of panicking he overcomes the obstacles in his way by thinking outside of the box to survive as long as possible. When NASA find out that Mark is still alive his former crew mates turn around for a rescue mission. The film is essentially a lone survival film without the protagonist not exactly getting too lonely or crazy. There is the parallel story of NASA and other agencies working together on the rescue mission as Mark's predicament catches the public's attention. The problem with this type of movie and it happened with Gravity is that you can be blown away with special effects the first time round but it might lack rewatch value.Smart, exciting crowd-pleaser Exceptional sci-fi drama from Ridley Scott about an astronaut (Matt Damon) stranded on Mars and the efforts made to rescue him. As others have pointed out, there's more than a little bit here that reminds you of movies like Apollo 13 and Cast Away (particularly the former). I fail to see how that's a knock on it but it's being presented as such by some. We all come to movies with our own expectations and baggage. I'm not a Scott fanboy expecting him to wow me (his last two films were not great). I just wanted to be entertained and this did the trick. It's a movie aimed at the masses that is smarter than your average movie aimed at the masses. Maybe it's not for all nerds (a quick glance at some of the reviews shows a lot of inane nit-picking from people who seem to have no concept of dramatic license), but I didn't find the movie dumbed-down at all. I also want to say how much I appreciated that this managed to stay remarkably light and positive while still maintaining the tension, proving once again that you don't have to be depressing to be good drama. If you haven't seen The Martian yet, you should. It's a great film with a first-rate cast, good direction, and stellar effects. If you're just looking for a quality movie to entertain you for a while, this should be something you'll enjoy.So touching! This film tells the remarkable story of an astronaut stranded on Mars during a space mission. He does everything he can to survive, while the Earth sets up an unprecedented rescue mission to bring him back home safely. Many people say "The Martian" is a very good film, and I do agree after watching it. The plot is simple but it has all the right elements to capture the viewers' hearts. To see Mark survive against all odds is very engaging and touching. In addition, the Herculean efforts to rescue him back to Earth is even more touching because there are almost insurmountable technical difficulties. The risk of failure is so high, that death seems almost certain. That of course brings about an poignant ending, which surely leaves me in tears. I enjoyed watching "The Martian".I wasn't overly fussy about it to be honest... (Credit IMDb) During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. The Martian was a major disappointment for me. Mars looks fantastic and everything looks great, but I wasn't able to ever fully get into it like I wanted to. It never felt like Matt Damon was in any true danger to me despite how it was presented otherwise. It tries way too hard to be epic and that's one of the reason it fails. I also felt it lacked suspense. One thing Gravity did well was deliver suspense, but The Martian doesn't. This surprised me a lot because Ridley Scott is a master at suspense. Even though I didn't really go nuts over this movie like a lot of people did, Matt Damon is fantastic. He holds the film together with his excellent performance. I can't really say the same for the rest. Everybody else isn't developed that well. Jessica Chastain is a very capable actress, but she isn't given much to do as I'd hoped. Wiig, Daniels, Bean, Mara, Ejiofor all do fine in the roles they are given. Ejiofor and Mara shine the most out of the people I listed This movie has its moments, but I was very disappointed overall. It looks great, Damon is superb, but I wasn't in love with it like so many others. Hopefully I'm not alone  6/10Typical Overrated ClaptrapFamiliar, Forced, and Forgettable Artificial, Derivative, and unwelcome Things like Forced and Unfunny one liners and...Wait for it.........A lot of Disco Muzak...while constantly Reminding the Audience just how Bad Disco Muzak is. The Film has very Little Style and the Shining, pristine Sets Look OK, but begin to Bore after a while. The Space Shots and the Mars Landscape, Ditto. The Acting is Stiff, and the PC inclusions are Distracting. All of the Action set Pieces, what Few there are, have been Seen in other Sci-Fi Films. The "Coming Together" of Earth's Population with Clichéd "Time Square" shots from Around the World have been Done to Death in the Genre, "War of the World's" (1953) and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" (1951), to Name a couple. In Fact, almost Everything in the Story has been Done before and the Film just Can't Escape it's Familiar Territory with anything New, Exciting, or Inventive. It really is a Big Disappointment and will only Seem Fresh to Young Folks and People that Don't Watch a lot of Movies. Overall, Average at Best, but Cookie-Cutter to the Extreme, Flat, Uninventive, and some severe Missteps (Disco and Stand Up Routines), Render this just Another Big Budget, quickly Forgotten, A-Picture trying to bring its B-Movie Pedigree to New Heights. Truth be Told, the B-Movies do it Better.My Favorite Martian Movie Hollywood has made approximately 29 movies about planet Mars. The five most recent sagas about Mars—"Mission to Mars" (2000), "Red Planet" (2000), "Doom" (2005), "John Carter" (2012), and The Last Days on Mars (2013)—failed to recoup their budgets. Among the notable films about Mars that most moviegoers may remember are the four-minute silent film "A Trip to Mars" (1910), the Soviet silent epic "Aelita" (1924), "Flight to Mars" (1951), "Conquest of Space" (1955), "The Angry Red Planet" (1956), "It! The Terror from Beyond Space" (1957), "Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1962), "Total Recall" (1990) and its' remake "Total Recall" (2012). "Mission to Mars" surpassed "Red Planet" while "John Carter" wasn't abominably bad. Halloween" helmer John Carpenter has probably made one of the least compelling pulp movies about Mars entitled "Ghosts of Mars." Happily, the latest movie about Mars appropriately entitled "The Martian" ranks as probably the best movie ever made about the fourth rock from the sun. Apart from its unwieldy 141 minutes that starts to drag about three-fourths of the way through, "The Martian" is a believable sci-fi film. Anybody who has read Andrew Weir's bestseller will be pleased with director Ridley Scott's largely faithful adaptation penned by Drew Goddard who wrote the abysmal "Cloverfield" but the brilliant "The Cabin in the Woods." Ostensibly, Scott and Goddard only saw fit to omit two major complications from Weir's fascinating first novel: the short-circuit drill scene when our hero is modifying the second Rover and the tumbling Rover scene on the journey to the Schiaparelli crater. The predominantly first-person narrated novel contains more of astronaut Mark Watney's acerbic, R-rated personality than the PG-13 film could afford. For example, read the first sentence in "The Martian." If either it or subsequent sentences with the F-word don't offend you, you can probably make it through this entertaining book rather rapidly. When a devastating Martian sandstorm threatens NASA's Ares III manned mission, Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain of "Interstellar") orders the six-person crew to abandon their work and lift off for their ship, the Hermes, in orbit around the red planet. During their hasty evacuation, one of the astronauts, botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon of "Interstellar"), is separated from the crew. Actually, he is struck by an antenna on a communication dish that skewers him in the stomach and knocks him unconscious. Lewis struggles without success to find Watney in the blinding sandstorm. Meanwhile, the sandstorm grows even more treacherous, and Lewis gives up her search because the high winds are tilting the ship that will launch the crew into orbit. Basically, the crew of the Ares III leaves Mark behind to save itself. NASA Chief Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels of "My Favorite Martian") reports the news of Watney's demise, and a funeral is held for him. What nobody knows at the time is that Watney is still alive. After he extracts the spear of the antenna from his stomach, Watney embarks on an ambitious scheme to keep himself alive for the next four years until Ares IV arrives. A major part of Watney's plan to keep from starving involves the planting of potatoes inside the mission's artificial habitat. Eventually, one of NASA's employees, Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis of "That Awkward Moment"), who monitors the satellites around Mars, spots something suspicious in the photos of the Ares III mission site. She alerts Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor of "American Gangster") about these curious occurrences. Everybody is suddenly elated when they discover that Watney managed to survive the savage sandstorm. Sanders brainstorms and convenes various NASA experts to work on a rescue plan for Watney, but NASA has no way of contacting our tenacious hero. At the same time, Watney behaves like the ingenious television character MacGuyer. He improvises a way to communicate with NASA that involves cruising in the Mars rover off to the distant site of the Mars Pathfinder probe. Meanwhile, Sanders refuses to notify the Hermes crew because he fears the revelation of Watney's survival may imperil the mission. Initially, NASA crew supervisor Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean of "GoldenEye") and JPL director Bruce Ng (Benedict Wong of "Prometheus") launch a space probe to resupply Watney until the Ares IV mission gets off the ground. The probe blows up not long after launch. If this were not bad enough for Watney, the habitat where he is raising his potato plants explodes when the airlock decompresses. Naturally, nothing goes right for either Watney or NASA, but salvation comes from the least expected place. "Blade Runner" director Ridley Scott keeps things compelling throughout most of "The Martian" as Watney and NASA encounter one invincible setback after another. Indeed, "The Martian" surpasses the similarly-themed Sandra Bullock &amp; George Clooney outer space epic "Gravity" because the story is related from a number of different perspectives. While Watney is struggling to survive on Mars, Sanders is under incredible pressure to concoct a foolproof plan to rescue him. Every plan that he comes up with requires his team to work so quickly that they cannot take their usual precautions. "The Martian" shifts back and forth between Watney and the various NASA officials working around the clock to save him. Eventually, Sanders allows Henderson to inform the Hermes crew about Watney's survival. Production values are generally stellar and nothing appears to have been spared. The craggy scenery of Jordan substitutes persuasively for the inhospitable Martian terrain. The part of the action transpires within the massive Hermes spaceship, and the five person crew weigh in on Watney's fate. Happily, "The Martian" isn't a dry, straightforward, documentary style sci-fi thriller. Although he doesn't appear on screen every minute, Matt Damon dominates "The Martian" and Watney's irreverent sense of humor. The inspirational finale when Watney decides to imitate Iron Man is amusing. Not only did NASA embrace author Andrew Weir, but the space agency also reportedly cooperated with Ridley Scott more than it had on previous movies to ensure accuracy. Altogether, "The Martian" qualifies as a gripping intergalactic spectacle.One of the year's best (and smartest) movies. THE MARTIAN (2015) **** Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover. Epic, fun and enthralling science fiction drama with Damon as a botanist left behind on Mars accidentally being believed to be killed on an expedition, resulting in his savvy brain trust (his and NASA's) to get him home in spite of tremendous odds, obstacles and pitfalls. Ridley Scott pulls out all the stops with brio and smartly sprinkles in dollops of self-ware, world-weary humor (thanks to a fine adaptation of Andy Weir's book by Drew Goddard) and a sterling cast including bright-eyed Chastain as his commander hell-bent on the rescue mission, Ejiofor and Daniels as squabbling team pundits and again, Damon in a career high turn as the self-possessed yet vulnerable Mark Watney in a performance ranking up there with Tom Hanks' in CASTAWAY &amp; Sandra Bullock's in GRAVITY ; in other words - Oscar-worthy. A must see in 3-D with some truly amazing visuals and a superb sound track of '70s disco tunes. One of the year's best (and smartest) movies.If I wrote this book, I'd be very upset with how it was handled. The author Andy Weir must be very upset with how his incredible book was watered down from a survival story to a vacation on Mars. Since he had no creative control, we can only blame Drew Goddard (screenplay) and Ridley Scott (director). The book is filled with science, math, intelligence, problem solving, tension, obstacles, survival and wise-ass remarks. Sadly, they decided to keep in the wise-ass comments and cut the rest. The movie feels like the main character is on a 2 year vacation on Mars, rather than fighting for his life and struggling to survive, like in the book. Day after day, he just waits to be rescued, without having to overcome much. This is my main problem with this film. They removed mostly all of the obstacles that Mark had to overcome to survive, and just glossed over what he did overcome. These obstacles demonstrate the intelligence and resolve of the character, all which is lost in the film. Removing the obstacles also removes the tension, which the book had plenty of. Here are some major obstacles that were in the book and not in the movie:  -Mark accidentally destroys the Pathfinder communications while drilling holes in the Rover roof. This prevents him from communicating with NASA for his entire journey to the Aries IV site. He's completely in the dark. On his own, trying to prepare for the LONG trip. Keeping this in would have added suspension that the filmed lacked. -While en route to the Aries IV site, Mark encounters a dust storm that delays his journey. The dust storm prevents the sun from recharging his Rover batteries via the solar panels. Mark has to figure out a way around the storm without dying, and also has time against him. He must avoid the storm and still make it to the Aries site before the MAV launches. This again would have added tension, conflict, and suspense. All missing from the film. In the film he just gets in his rover, and a few days later, arrives 3200km away, exactly where he needs to. It's lazy. -Mark finally overcomes the storm, figures out a solution, and cheats death. Back on track, just as he's nearing the Aries IV site, he goes off a ridge and flips his rovers and almost dies again. He has to problem solve to get to the MAV site on time before the launch. This would have added more tension, more suspense...all which is lost in the film version. -The book has Mark deploying a pop-up tent from the Rover Airlock to sleep in on his journey. The movie skips all of this, and instead show him sleeping under the rover...in the freezing mars atmosphere. It was interesting to me in the book how he crafted a custom tent for his bedroom for the journey. -The book goes into detail on survival on a foreign planet, with numbers to back it up. It explains everything in the HAB, and what it's for. The film merely mentions a few key things, but never explains what they are for. Like how does he have enough oxygen to survive? How is he removing the CO2 from the air so that it doesn't reach toxic levels? This would have been great to show Mark figuring these out on screen in real time. Show how smart he is...that maybe he can get out of this if he puts his mind to it. All skipped. I can't believe they don't mention oxygen supply once. They assume if he's in a suit, he can breath. "I'm going to have to science the s*** out of this." ... So much so that you won't even know he used any science at all.. What's so great in the book is how Mark is able to MacGyver everything, and overcome all of the obstacles that come in his way in order to survive. When you remove all of those obstacles, it just feels like Mark is waiting on another planet for his friends to pick him up. It loses all tension, all suspense...they took way too many shortcuts. You may argue that time was an issue, and that is why those scenes were cut. Nah...I don't need the final celebration scenes in the movie, the post credit roll that highlights the actors, the final scene where Mark is an instructor. Cut all that out and put in the good stuff. The stuff that life is about...obstacles and overcoming them. Bottom line, it's lazy, and doesn't do the book justice. If you want the real movie experience where you actually care about the characters and what's transpiring, listen to book.It's a good movie, but it's a great book. (Very minor comparisons to the book- no direct reference to scenes) I recently read 'The Martian'. It's a book I had wanted to pick up for a long time and when I saw the film was soon to arrive, in the usually capable hands of Ridley Scott and Matt Damon, it seemed like the perfect time to pick it up. I'll start by saying the book is incredible, and quite possibly the best book I've read in years. Once you pick it up it's impossible to put back down and I was finished in a couple of days. The detail that Andy Weir goes into in describing the surroundings and Mark Watney's predicament are so detailed it makes for a compelling read. What makes the book strong eventually becomes the film's downfall. There is just too much in the book to include in a film. As a result a lot of detail is chopped to keep the film from becoming too complicated...and it's already running at 2hours 20minutes. Changes have been made to the original story, for what can only be deemed 'Hollywood reasons' although whilst creating a slight frown on the face of anyone who has read the book, doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film. I am sure there is a Ridley cut of this film out there which will run to over 3 hours and no doubt cover off some of my gripes. All in all, if you want to see this film, read the book first.Do I need to watch this movie or the Description is enough ?? (Warning: possible spoilers below) ...somewhere on Mars, the following drama unfolds: After many tries to send the signal (that ingenuity, wit etc, from the description) our hero is about to give up; his equipment is failing and the signal just can't reach the Earth. Then, with the last electrons firing up his synapse and while his eyes are closing forever, he had a providence: Fire up that last electromagnetic wave, left in the transceiver, right to mountain, bounce it off the moon, and right to the place on Earth where the receiving satellite/radar/whatever resides. IF AND ONLY IF his calculation is right, the signal will be able to reach reach the radar. But, there is a slight problem and fortunately, our hero knows about it - even when the signal reaches the radar, it'll be too weak and under the radar detection threshold. But he knows what to do - shoot the signal to the outer space, right where the electromagnetic storm (from the sun) is building up. There, this tiny electromagnetic wave will amplify, will bounce off the Venus, will hit the moon and finally reach the earth, as we said previously... He has only one chance to do this, as the storm is rapidly moving out of solar system. As you can see, both the timing and calculations have to be perfect, making this a nail-biting drama... ...somewhere on Earth, the following drama unfolds: After many desperate hours, our main character, she, the scientists, is slowly accepting the reality of the situation; she stays last at work, taking on her the task to switch of the satellite. She feels it's her responsibility all that happened. But she just can't leave yet – somewhere deep, she starts realizing she is love with our brave hero. She stares to the screen for hours, slowly realizing it's about time to give up and leave him to the stars She exhales, stands up, and walks toward the main switch But just when she was about to flip that switch, she sees a reflection on the switch metal plate: THE RED LIGHT ON THE SATELLITE LIT UP !!! (The music builds up here) What happened next I don't even have to tell you; a frantic rescue mission begins. Another drama unfolds; will they reach him before he spends all the oxygen?? Story short: they've found him, breathing the very last oxygen molecule he had left...  All the drama ends with a huge applause back at the research base. But the movie doesn't end yet; just about a minute left for her to kiss him, before the movie lights go outRiddley Scott's decadence The decadence of Ridley Scott in my opinion. The one who offered us some great movies ("Allien" is enough I believe to make the comparison and point out the importance of a good scenario and small budget to create a "great" movie). The whole movie hasn't created, to me at least, the feeling of agony and suspense that was meant to create and I cannot understand the dithyrambic critics (8.2 IMDb score?). More it was a movie like "Indepedence Day", where the "good guys" win nomatter what..... A great disappointment from Ridley Scott and a movie that did not offer anything new, from a director that has created collosal movies in the past (what to count first: Blade Runner, Allien, Gladiator..... 0.Another masterpiece from Ridley Scott First of all,the review is spoiler free so feel free to read it if you haven't seen the movie yet. Firstly,the cast. They are all excellent and experienced actors and actresses and they did their job on the level that it should be done.Starting with Matt Damon who plays astronaut Mark Watney.His acting ability is great and he made 100% effort to role.Certainly one of his best roles. Jessica Chastain plays the role of mission commander Melissa Lewis,which suits her just fine,knowing that she has experience with movies about space.She played in the Interstellar last year which was one of the best movie of the year. Not to mention Sean Bean,who is absolutely amazing and most likely one of the best actors in Hollywood.Although he plays a minor role in this movie that hasn't stopped him to act so well. One of the biggest pluses in the movie is surly acting. A bit about the plot(without spoiling anything),most of the time atmosphere is very intense and serious,but there are several scenes with good sense of humor which helps the viewers to relax after very intense scene. Visual effects and CGI. Mars looks as it should look because of all the CGI effects of the place where movie was shoot and it is really nice to see,especially in 4K resolution and 3D technology.All rocket launches,explosions and martian storms are done perfectly.It really makes you feel they're real. In conclusion this is definitely Oscar worth movie and one of the best movies of the year,if not the best.Space fanatics(like me) will enjoy the movie all the time and will feel the tension as it is supposed to be felt.If anyone thinks they won't understand a single word in the movie,I can tell they're wrong.The movie is made for everyone,children,teenagers,adults and scientists so everyone will be able to understand what're they talking about.Will be misunderstood This movie is portraying what it would take for someone stuck on Mars to survive. The movie shows what would be needed to get the person back to earth and how the survivor would have to navigate the technology.  So when Matt Damon is acting all chill and joking around, for me it seemed like he was being ironic about the real chances of surviving. In the end, it would be pretty much impossible for a man left on Mars to survive. Period. I also liked how they portrayed NASA as a good guy and bad guy at times. Matt Damon's performance is really good. Unlike some of Ridley Scott's recent movies, this one was a thrilling and satisfying one.Best. Film. Ever Seriously. I thought this was perfect. For the last hour or so (from when they start playing Starman as the crew on Hermes enact the plan to go back and rescue) I was fully emotionally engaged, and as absorbed as I have ever been in a film. The film is well paced, with good inserts of humour (to relieve the tension). The best is Sean Bean explaining why the new rescue plan is named Elrond, after the council which reached dangerous but decisive decision in Lord of the Rings. The science grew in complexity, and was always believable if sometimes not perfect (don't know where extra oxygen coming from for explosion, and not sure why they got weight and hence acceleration and then altitude wrong when he takes off from Mars, but at the time who cared) it never got into pseudo science or techno-babble. I have read critical reviews complaining of "no emotional engagement", and one saying "no explanation why so motivated to get back to earth". I don't like criticising other reviews - everyone has a right to their opinion - but really. Perhaps their life's are so unemotional and empty of hope and imagination that the simple idea of continuing to live isn't enough. I had to sit and wait before I drove home as I was still choked up 15 minutes after the end (and I am an notoriously unemotional bloke out of the old school). Both my daughters (ages 11 and 17) agreed with best they've seen. I really hope this popularises reality, science and true adventure. It won't, but it should win every award going. I haven't mentioned actors - I judge excellence when I forget the actor and focus on character. After the abandonment on Mars Matt Damon was forgotten and it was just Mark Watney, which is the highest praise I can give. Others all believable and solid. Final spoiler - Sean Bean doesn't die! For anyone with interest in good old Newtonian physics, adventure, and great visuals should rush to see. Best film everA Supermassive Monster-tainer! I superduper love the book. Andy Weir's book is practically celebrating the geeky nerd in me, but I am under no illusion that Ridley Scott can just take huge chunks of Mark Watney's thoughts and monologues, shoot them and wala the movie would work. It wouldn't. The science experiments, the guess and check methodology and the constant hypothesis testing do not make for anything cinematic and most people will go into deep space slumber by Sol 47. What Scott and his team did is to take all the compelling narrative elements and propel them with an authoritative drive, and The Martian becomes for me, this year's most undeniable supermassive monster-tainer of the nth degree.  The narrative is not new. I am sure anyone can see this is a concoction of Robinson Crusoe, with a heavy dose of Apollo 13 and Gravity. I love this genre tremendously and I am now going to tell you a secret - I love watching terrible movies like Deep Blue Sea and Anaconda. There, I said it, and I don't care if I lose your respect :). There is something so primal, singular and compelling about a character solving problems to survive in the face of insurmountable odds. In The Martian, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. This narrative can be found in many films and it is IMHO best articulated by this quote - "I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying." If you know where this is taken from, we must be related in some way :). Watney articulates the same sentiment in the epilogue of the movie, which is not found in the book. How Scott succeeded in reining in his usual self-important space opera mumbo jumbo is already cause for celebration. His hand is light, sure and every creative choice he made serves the story. We get wide vistas of Mars and the spacecraft, but somehow Scott stops himself from underscoring them with his usual larger than life signature. By doing that the story of one extraordinary man on Mars becomes front and centre, and bigger than everything. The cast is solid all round, especially Matt Damon who carries the movie on his everyday man's shoulders. His smarts and snarky personality shining through. We rise and fall on his little successes like repurposing his excrement as fertilizer and we laugh with him through his not too outrageous notion of colonization.  For once, and for such a welcome relief, this movie is populated with super-intelligent people who don't do stupid dumb things like touching unknown objects or walking into unknown territory. This particular genre is full of these stereotypes but you will find none here. There is not much melodrama here to manipulate you emotionally. You are not going to see a scene of an insufferable wife calling from Earth to make sure Watney doesn't give up (watch Everest for that and I don't mean that in a bad way). What we have here is a tenacious man solving problems like how to make water, grow food, and communicate with NASA on an unforgiving planet. There is no monster, no inner demons, no anger towards God, just one man who is ready to "science the sh*t out of it" as he "gets busy living".  Who would have thought watching a man's constant efforts to stay alive for another day makes for such compelling cinema. Some of the great stuff in the book like the broken drill bit and the accident with the rover on the final trip to Ares 4 didn't make it into the film, but I am not taking any points away. This is a superb tribute to human ingenuity and will probably make young people want to study harder. It may not have pushed the envelope in terms of cinema but it succeeded in what it set out to do - a supermassive feel-good visual extravaganza. I am so glad I sat between my wifey and a geeky teenager. The dude was gasping in wonder and cheering animatedly through some of the amazing scenes. This type of special effects money can't buy. My wife said that boy is probably me when I was a boy. She is right.This is a movie that is done well, super entertaining and one that you can watch over and over again. I highly recommend this. "At some point, everything's gonna go south on you and you're going to say, this is it. This is how I end. Now you can either accept that, or you can get to work." Finally a manned mission to Mars has taken place and a group of astronauts are conducting tests on the planet. When a storm hits the crew tries to make it back to their ship but Mark Watney (Damon) is struck and lost. With no other choice the crew leaves without him and they fear the worst. When Nasa receives a message from Mark a plan is needed not only to retrieve him, but to find a way to keep him alive on a barren planet. Mark must see how resourceful he can be. Every once in a while a movie comes out where you want to tell everyone you know to see it because its that good. This is one of those movies. To me the sci fi genre has had a strong showing the last few years with movies like Gravity, Intersteller and now this one. This movie has suspense, drama and a ton of comedy. This is one of the most entertaining times I have had watching a movie in a while. This is a movie that is done well, super entertaining and one that you can watch over and over again. Overall, a movie that had the suspense of Apollo 13 but lighter and more fun to watch. I highly recommend this. Watch this today. I give this an A+.I Loved The Movie But......... Why? Why? Why would you make such a great movie and put an actor like Kristen Wiig in it? She was a low point of the movie. She CANNOT ACT at the level of the other actors. Thank goodness she had a small part. Luckily the movie is so good it barely distracted the audience. Other then that I found the movie to be great. It held my interests and kept me on the edge of my seat. The special effects were tremendous. I thought I was on Mars with the actors. I found the scenery to be realistic and not on a set. It set the mood for someone being alone and so far from home. When the scene started with a far away shot as if it was from a probe orbiting Mars, you felt marooned. If you want to see a wonderful Science-Fiction movie this is one you should not miss.So much better, than Interstellar This movie actually was more funny, than many comedies, such as Dirty Grandpa for example. This was nice, as i was a bit worried because of the length of the movie and the fact it was about a single man, trying to survive alone on another planet. What surprised me the most was Matt Damon's performance. A lot of movies with him i get the impression, that he just plays....Matt Damon. This time though we could see some acting skills from him. Overall a great movie! Me and my wife enjoyed it and even it was very late we didn't stop to end watching it some other day. I don't get the IMDb score sometimes. Probably the worst space movie of all time - Interstellar has a higher score than this?An Amazing Tension-Filled Space Journey with Beautiful Cinematography "WOW" is the one word I would describe this movie. Just wow. Today I sat down in my small theater expecting a good space movie with some tension filled scenes. And I got that, but it wasn't "good" it was Amazing. I have to start this review by saying if you haven't watch this movie in a theater yet, Do it! The cinematography is unbelievable and has to be experienced on the big screen. I noticed myself wondering if they actually filmed on Mars. So all credit goes to: Dariusz Wolski Both the writing and directing in this movie was on point. I'm very glad for Ridley Scott, this is easily one of his best movies. And the acting was great, With a surprisingly great performance from Jeff Daniels as Teddy Sanders aka "Bad guy but not really" To be honest, I'm pretty bad when it comes to rating a movie, but as of right now I would give this movie 9.5 pies out of 10 ---My first review so keep that in mind----A Classic and a Masterpiece Just seen it! Brilliant! Great story, great acting, great directing, great cinematography and much more - a feast for the human eye.  Matt Damon's acting is excellent throughout, at times delivered with his own charming sense of humour and he is the linchpin that holds the film together complimented by the rest of the cast. It's far from being completely focused on Matt Damon; the story is well balanced between all the varied scenes and to me Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Kate Mara and Chiwetel Ejiofor really stand out. Great casting and, of course, great directing by Ridley Scott.  The scenery, CGI, 'hardware' and props give the movie gravitas and an unquestioned sense of feeling real absorbing you into the story and adding a sense of gravitas. The overall production is a credit to everybody involved and an an unreserved success.  Not perfect but a masterpiece of entertainment, storytelling and celebration of the human spirit. Beautiful and at times very touching. I command you to go and see this movie! A Classic and a Masterpiece.An Odyssey for our time In most disaster films, there's always a convenient human (or animal, or monster) villain for the audience to direct their hate and fear towards. Think of 'Sunshine', where a science-based movie devolved into a slasher flick in the third act. It's as if Hollywood couldn't conceive of any other way to generate drama. With 'The Martian', Ridley Scott has shown that it can be done, and done very well indeed. It's just men and women against the elements, modern heroes using technology to solve problems. It would have been so easy to depict the NASA director as the stereotypical villain, but thankfully they didn't. Everyone pulls together, everyone does the right thing. Watney doesn't lose his dignity at any point. No curling up into a ball and crying, no going crazy. Just a calm acceptance of the facts, and an unwavering resilience. After the appalling mystical nonsense of 'Prometheus' and 'Exodus: Gods and Kings', it's a welcome relief to see that the only use religious artifacts have in this film is to be used as kindling ("They burned a cross in this movie!"). It's another welcome relief to see a movie with intelligent people in it that are actually normal, and not awkward/nerdy/sociopathic/psychotic, as Hollywood always portrays them. There aren't any insulting attempts to 'humanise' them either - no cutesy stuff like painting a face on a basketball (or robot) to have an imaginary friend - smart people don't need that nonsense. For technophiles, there's a spate of references: 'byte sniffing' a file, reverse engineering, hex editing, chemistry, a steely-eyed missile man, and many more. I'm so happy to finally see a movie celebrating human intelligence, science and technology. This film is without a doubt Scott's finest work. I just hope he can bring the same elements to the Alien sequel. Bloopers: Breathing creates an excess of oxygen? We use about 25% of the oxygen we inhale in each breath, so how would breathing increase the oxygen in the hab? Were the technical advisors on leave that day? Why couldn't Watney jury-rig a simple text/voice transmitter using Pathfinder? I know he's a botanist, but surely astronauts get basic training in electronics. I guess soldering isn't as interesting as jumping around sticking sticks in sand. The capture of Watney is needlessly Hollywoodized. A bunch of scientists had a few months to think of a solution, and the best they could come up with was to manually grab Watney as he flies by? How about using material from the spaceship to construct a giant net, or even simpler, putting one on board the resupply rocket?A very fun, entertaining, and optimistic film, highly recommended I spent the whole day waiting to go to the theater to see this. Due to some inconveniences I missed lunch (there is a point to this just wait) so by the time I left I was starving and in a rush to get there in time for the film. I got there bought my ticket and relaxed. I sat there as my stomach growled and waited till the movie started, from start to finish I didn't once think of being hungry or when this movie was going to get over so I could eat. This film immersed me so fast I didn't have time to crave any food besides my hunger helped me relate with the main character. This movie is surprisingly hilarious, when I think of an astronaut being isolated millions of miles from earth I would have never expected an approach showing so much humor and optimism. The good thing about the humor is is that it isn't corny or stupid it's almost always clever. The optimism is a great aspect that at a time were in now gives us a breath of fresh air, a lot of films now a days and TV shows for this matter usually get really dark and turn away viewers this film is good for almost all audiences due to the positivity. Even in moments where odds get very narrow the optimism Matt Damon's character has shines through that narrow opening almost always in the film. The only group I see hating this are those who don't like Matt Damon in the presence of a movie. If you don't like him your not gonna like this movie because 85% of this movie is all him. I for one really like Matt Damon and the character he plays on screen. Things that go without saying such as that the technical aspects and acting are all great. Overall I can't think of a bad thing to say about this film. What I do have to say is that you should see this movie (unless your anti Damon) because the film shows how even in a distressing situation such as this everyone can come together regardless to bring this man home and if you ask me this is something we need not just in this country right now but in the world. I urge you to see this film as you will most likely enjoy it and catch the inspiration that lies within as well. Thanks for reading my review and I hope you enjoy the film.Cast Away meets Apollo 13 Cast Away meets Apollo 13 is the best way I can describe The Martian. Ridley Scott gives us the story about how an astronaut is presumed dead on Mars and how he must now survive on Mars until NASA can send help. First off this movie has a stellar cast. Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean (who I was surprised to see in the movie) and Chiwetel Ejiofor. All of the cast has great chemistry with each other, but Damon is the one who shines and gives an Oscar worthy performance. Scott perfectly captures what is it is like to be on Mars and how helpless we would be in that kind of situation. The movie is also really funny, in fact more funny than most of the comedies that I have seen this year.  But its not all fun and games, when Damon is pulling a piece of shrapnel from his body your not laughing. When very suspenseful events are going down your not laughing. This shows how great Scotts direction is and how he is able to blend drama, comedy, and suspense perfectly. In the end I had a great time with The Martian it is Ridley Scott's best work in years and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.2 hours 24 minutes of PURE excitement! I watched this movie a lot LATER than it was released, thanks to my friends who told me that the movie is long &amp; boring (never to judge a movie based on friends' opinions). But to kill time, I went on to watch this movie and WOW, WHAT A MOVIE!!! I must say, for a very long movie, this is a VERY good movie! it actually keeps you excited throughout the movie.  Excellent acting by Matt Damon! think yourself in place on Mark Watney in the movie and all the struggle, then you will realize how does it feel and how has Matt portrayed that struggle, WOW! Hats off to the whole crew of The Martian, you truly have made a SUPERB movie! BRAVO!Ridley Scott at his best The Martian is a 2015 science-fiction film that is directed by Ridley Scott,who finally decided to make good movies again,and stars Matt Damon as Mark Watney in the leading role.Other stars are Jessica Chastain,Kristen Wiig,Jeff Daniels,Michael Peña, Kate Mara,Sean Bean,Sebastian Stan,Aksel Hennie,and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The film is about some astronauts who after a storm blast off the planet Mars but they leave behind Mark Watney as he is presumed dead.He turns out to have survived the storm and with only a few supplies and food for counted days,he must use science and grow food in a place where nothing grows in order to survive until the next rescue mission comes for him. I seriously loved this movie,the performances are all very great,especially Matt Damon who gives the performance of a lifetime.He seems very much committed to the role and he is full of emotion that equals to a great and Oscar-worthy performance. Ridley Scott does an incredible job here with the way that he decides to take on the story and also the ending is just brilliant and very well directed. The score by Harry Gregson-Williams is also very haunting and memorable but what stands out the most here is the incredibly amazing cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. The Mars scenes look great and they just feel real,them mixed with the very good visual effects just make for the perfect once in a lifetime experience. I really enjoyed The Martian and it's certainly one of the best movies of 2015.Ridley Scott is back with a bang.brainwash I don't like this movie because its NASA propaganda is hard stuff in this film! Its brainwash and stupid people believe that crap... this movie is overrated! they tell you they are broadcasting their missions live on TV...lol, they brainwash you in this movie you have to think, that Nasa only have 5 minutes left to tell the public the truth-..lol Nasa is the biggest liar on earth! when you asking me! OK guys now watch this movie but be sure its all BS. its manipulation of your minds! its a commercial video of Freemason NASA fake factory not even worth to watch!I don't know why this film is overrated like that? may be there are many trolls or bought votes!?
Visual poetry - and a celebration of human resilience as well as an ode to the savage beauty of nature A lot has been said and written about this film, mostly about its troubled production - forget all that: it has no meaning whatsoever for the experience this film provides. A word of advice though: if you go in expecting a testosterone-fueled revenge thriller in the vein of 'Apocalypto', you'll likely end up disappointed. It's simply not that kind of film - but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it if you watch it with the right expectations. 'The Revenant' opens with images from a dream; we see snippets of memories showing a peaceful life - and soon the loss of that peace, and the loss of life. The images change and we hear the soothing sound of gurgling water as we follow the camera via a long tracking shot over a flooded forest; it's an image that seems to imply peace, evoking nature's beauty with an almost meditative quality - before the barrel of a rifle appears in the frame. Those first three minutes I just described (which are the only spoilers you will get in this review) set the tone for the film perfectly. It's a film that tells a story of harrowing circumstances through images that are breathtakingly beautiful; a film about survival and death and shocking acts of sudden violence - and yet a film that, despite all its visceral intensity, also has a quiet, immersive quality to it that feels almost hypnotic. Many critics and reviewers have pointed out the stark contrast between the film's poetic beauty and the ugliness of its violence - implying the director wanted to use this contrast to make a certain point regarding mankind's interference with nature. While that would seem pretty obvious (and it probably is at least partly true), I left the film feeling Iñarritu had shown a vaster, far too complete image of the clash between man and nature to justify such a simplistic interpretation of the events portrayed on screen. Whether intentionally or not, Iñarritu shows the star of his film with a complexity and honesty that we normally don't get to see in these kinds of stories. And I'm not talking about Leonardo DiCaprio here (who gives a no-holds-barred, crazy good performance and I'd love to see him win an Oscar for this film) - the star of this film is not a person: it IS nature, plain and simple. The revenge plot - which felt almost like an afterthought or a ploy to give the film a certain structure and a proper ending - is not really the film's main theme or strongest aspect, and it certainly isn't the reason that made this film so compelling to watch for me. Such stories have been told often enough - and often better - than in 'The Revenant'. No, what really made this film stand out for me is that I have NEVER seen a Hollywood film (any film, really - apart from documentaries) that showed nature in such an unflinchingly honest and mesmerizing way as was the case here. And the way I perceive it, Iñarritu sees his human protagonists as being very much a part of nature as a whole - regardless of their destructive behaviour.  It's that refreshingly wholistic approach (which some viewers might perceive as nihilism on the director's part) that I found to be the film's biggest accomplishment: it depicts the people in this story as just another species trying to survive in that perilous frontier-world. The emphasis is not really on the moral aspects of the brutal injustice that the main character suffers or how the Native Americans are cruelly exploited; we witness all that - but Iñarritu keeps a certain emotional distance, as if he were shooting a documentary about predatory wildlife. And just like the bear's attack, most of the violence in this film comes as a reaction of defense. Be it self-defense, defending one's offspring or defending territory and valuable resources. Even the character that comes closest to an actual villain is driven by fear - not hate, and his most obvious character defects were caused by a very traumatizing experience. As in nature, there is a simple (if often brutal) logic to why most characters, men or beasts, act the way they do in 'The Revenant' (OK, maybe not the French - but I didn't say the film was perfect, did I). And the bear attack was the most realistic depiction of an animal attack I have ever seen on film. All in all, this film felt less like a story of revenge and more like an ode to the visceral beauty of nature and the relentless, savage force that is life; it provides an immensely absorbing - and touching - experience to those who have an affinity for the wilderness, but it's also a visual masterpiece and a great piece of old-school filmmaking for lovers of Cinema. It's not perfect (especially during the last third of the film where I felt the pacing was a bit off), but it's a film the likes of which we will only rarely get to see - if at all - in the future. 'The Revenant' is visual poetry of the most primal kind, and it should be seen on the biggest screen possible. 9 stars out of 10 from me. Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/ Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/ Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Great photography, not so great film You are almost immediately plunged into the action, in a similar way to the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan', with a Native American attack on a group of fur trappers. DiCaprio even does that momentarily deaf thing that Tom Hanks does. Lots of bows and arrows and gore and excellent photography that is really immersive. Great opening scene. There there's the scene where DiCaprio is mauled by a grizzly bear. Again, really believable, exciting and up front and personal - you can almost smell the bear's stinking breath. Brilliant.  And then there's ... well ... not much really. Photography and scenery are by and large excellent but you do get the feeling that better use could have been made of them. Iñárritu often seems to chop scenes around for no particular reason, although you do get the occasional sense of the vast wilderness that comes over well on the big screen. Dialogue is scarce. Most of it goes to Tom Hardy who tries to put on a Texan accent but succeeds in sounding as if he has a sock in his mouth (does he specialise in being inaudible? remember him as the mumbling Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises'?).  Then there's the storyline. You know the ending, right? (Just look up the definition of 'revenant'.) Leo is up against it and he suffers a great deal. But you know he is going to survive. So when, to top everything, he falls off a cliff on his horse you realise he's actually become Mr Indestructible. And two and a half hours of crawling, grimacing and wincing does not a very entertaining film make. There are also several non-credible plot twists. Like when Tom Hardy (a.k.a. The Mumbler) somehow cracks an impressive-looking safe and makes off with the garrison money and just two guys go after him, including the garrison commander. This nicely sets up the final confrontation between Mr Indestructible and The Mumbler .... but really?  We also develop little or no emotional connection with the main character. The silent dream scenes are a clichéd way of trying to do this and they don't work in my opinion - they're just puzzling and boring. Nor do we see much of the relationship between Leo and his son to set up the emotional links between them - just Leo being harsh and dishing out tough love a couple of times.  The pacing is also poor. Once you've passed the opening scene and the grizzly scene, feel free to go and refresh your popcorn - you won't miss much.  Overall, the film is self-consciously bleak and overdetermined and is unevenly paced. A better director might possibly have made this a good film but Iñárritu is clearly not David Lean. If DiCaprio gets an Oscar for this it will be because the Academy think they owe him one and possibly because of the hype. This is a film that will be forgotten. If you want to see a good silent movie with snow, ice, struggle for survival and even the odd grizzly bear thrown in, watch Chaplin's 'The Gold Rush' - it's far more entertaining.One of the Best Movies I'll never watch twice The Revenant falls into the same category as Aronofsky's "Requiem for a Dream" and Spielberg's "Schindler's List" for me, in the essence of being a terrific movie but not something I think I can sit through a second time. In all these movies there are brutal sequences that cause emotional stress and disgust just watching because it is so REAL and GRIPPING. To think that events in these movies actually happened or that they could very well happen is too much for me to think about. Not to say that I did not enjoy this film thoroughly.  The Revenant is a technical masterpiece that left me wondering "How the hell did they do that?" after many scenes and sequences. With beautiful cinematography and adroit camera movement this film is a visual magnum opus. It is apparent that the great minds that put forth this film are none other than the same ones that brought us Birdman: Lubezki and Inarritu. There are many long shots without cuts that are sprinkled throughout the film that add a sense of sophistication to it with the added bonus of predominantly location based shooting and natural lighting for the film , that can even make a novice film watcher raise an eyebrow at its complexity.  The camera work is not the only noteworthy aspect of the film; The actors did a superb job executing their rolls. Many are raving about DiCaprio's performance but I was more of a fan of Hardy's brutal and gritty character Fitzgerald. Granted, half the words that came out of his mouth were unintelligible but he left no doubt in my mind that he was fully devoted to his role and bringing Fitzgerald alive instead of just Hardy playing a character named Fitzgerald. He was simply amazing. With all this said, there are still flaws in the film. At some points it was dragging on and moving too slow. It gave the impression that the film itself was cocky and wanted to show off all of its beautiful scenery and camera work too much. Then there was the "he shouldn't be alive" situations. Hugh Glass was a real guy that really did survive a bear mauling but in the film they make this guy practically immortal. There were too many instances where I was thinking "he should be dead three times over right now, for me to enjoy the film as much I should have.  All in all a great film that I only recommend to seasoned and mature film viewers.Visually beautiful, story-wise not on par... The natural landscape and some of the scenes are overwhelming and spectacular! The camera-work is so immersive, you believe are a part of Hugh Glass' journey through the wilderness and back to civilization. Also with great performances not only by DiCaprio, but also Hardy, as the unsympathetic fellow fur trapper leaving Glass behind.  Story-wise, it is a bit thin for a 156 min picture. Glass' quest for vengeance is sometimes lost as he utters few words about his drive and is being more or less, chased himself. The story arc of the Indians quest for their daughter felt a bit out of place and strange. We also get to see the fur trappers p.o.v. that left Glass behind and the Captain way ahead of them. Which in my opinion takes a little bit of the magic of Glass' total perilous journey. All my stars goes to the beauty, production value and performances alone! Regardless, this is one of those overlong movies one like, but would not sit out for another viewing!A Powerfully Bleak &amp; Masterful Film Take the direction of Alejandro González Iñárritu, combine it with the stunning cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki and toss in Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy for their acting charms and what do you get? An extraordinary and masterful film. Fresh off of 'Birdman,' Iñárritu moved straight on to 'The Revenant,' a western-epic inspired by the true-life experiences of frontiersman Hugh Glass in the winter-struck landscape of 1820s America. The film gained some notoriety in mid-2015 for its production problems and has thus been regarded one of the most challenging film shoots in the history of cinema. Rightfully so. The film opens with the soothing sound of running water, thrusting the audience into an almost meditative state, and then it strikes, an action-packed sequence ensues with a near single sweeping take. Now this is a spoiler-free review, so I'll leave the pleasure of viewing that scene to you. This film heavily evokes reactions from the audience and does so well, whether it's staring at the screen in awe or gasping at the visceral violence, if you face this film with the right attitude and expectations, it will be a thrill ride like no other. Lubezki has proved that he is one of the most fantastic cinematographers of modern cinema, and the extensive use of natural lighting over artificial supports that statement even further, the film is beyond stunning. Supporting this is the score from the relatively unknown composers, believe me, when the sudden orchestral boom strikes your eardrums, it's mesmerising. The makeup, the direction, the editing, the visual aesthetics, and of course the performances from a hopefully soon-to-be Oscar winning DiCaprio, 'The Revenant' is a visual treat for those who appreciate cinema and for those who wish to just get absorbed by the immense landscapes and poetic justice Iñárritu has given it. This is, for me, a modern masterpiece.A classic case of style over substance What an absolute waste of 2.5 hours. It didn't look like it was going to be my type of film, but the trailer was very convincing, not to mention the plethora of award nominations it has received, so I decided to give it a go. Mistake. It started with a collection of superb actors, delivering solid performances. Despite what I've read, I thought Tom Hardy's accent was spot on - that is what that accent sounds like! Domhnall Gleeson is in everything these days, for good reason, and Will Poulter was certainly endearing. Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent, dragging oneself through the snow post-bear mauling should be pretty torturous, and as we know from Wolf of Wall Street's infamous 'Ludes' scene, DiCaprio is a pro at crawling and grunting. A cast such as this should have delivered an outstanding movie, so I can only assume something went catastrophically wrong with the script. Because my God was it BORING. There was absolutely zero character development. If you're going to produce something that is on the long side, at least give me something to work with here? The son was killed so early (and following so few lines) I genuinely didn't care, which didn't help to lay a foundation for why I should care about Glass's prolonged revenge mission.  As well as the characters being entirely 2D, they also quickly became parodies of themselves. "The Revenant Presents: Domhnall Gleeson as the Principled Yet Naive Captain (who must die as punishment for his ineptitude); Tom Hardy as the Southern Villain (with no redeeming features, who likewise must die to maintain the idea of a Just World); Will Poulter as the Impressionable Young Soldier-type and Leonardo DiCaprio as the Tortured Hero. Don't forget the Arrogant French Braggarts, and the Wise Yet Ruthless Indigenous People. Oh and Tom Hardy's Random Cockney Friend." While I still think Hardy's accent was well executed, the choice to use an accent which is often a source of ridicule (I'm not endorsing that view) only served to undermine the tension rather than build it, making him seem like a fool rather than a dangerous adversary. Admittedly, he did a kill a number of people so maybe playing The Fool was his way of lulling everyone into a false sense of security. DiCaprio was convincing in his role of the Aggrieved Father avenging the death of his son, but his journey of adversity quickly became absurd rather than laudable. The bear attack was BRUTAL, and as his company quickly concluded, it seems unlikely he would have survived his injuries, particularly when being carted around in the depth of winter.  But no, not only does he survive, he also survives Hardy's attempt to smother him, and being dragged into a partial burial, as well as witnessing the murder of his son (which would be enough to render any of us catatonic). OK, this might be plausible, maybe. Then he wanders around for a bit, spurred on by the prospect of vengeance, before being nearly drowned in a river. Again, the trip down the rapids would have been enough to drown the average man, let alone someone who has just suffered a savage bear attack followed by an attempted smothering. But no, he comes to a gentle stop at the river bank and has a nap - mysteriously without succumbing to hypothermia. Cue more wandering, some assistance from a kindly fellow wanderer, and yet more wandering. As if three potential deaths weren't enough (four if you account for the bear effectively attacking him twice), he's then under attack by the very people who's daughter he's just rescued, and not only does he not get shot (despite these people having been shown to be frighteningly accurate), his horse RIDES HIM OFF A CLIFF and surprise, surprise - HE LIVES! In fact, he doesn't just survive it, he guts the dead horse and SLEEPS INSIDE IT. *Beats chest asserting manliness* By the end I was desperate for one of them to just kill the other so I could go home. Tom Hardy finally met his maker - not before uttering the obligatory moral message that revenge doesn't make us feel better. The Revenant is a classic case of style over substance. Fantastic actors, slipping effortlessly into a range of clichéd characters, stunning cinematography, and zero emotion. I'm a crier, I will cry at the majority of films and TV shows (and occasionally books), so the fact that I not only didn't cry, but felt absolutely nothing towards any of the characters, says it all. It's clearly a polarising piece of work, I've seen many other reviews here that echo my sentiments, yet my boyfriend loved it, and the average rating is currently 8.3! Unfortunately, Award Land appears to be siding with my other half. This year's Oscar Best Picture category is a crowded race with several worthy contenders - but the Revenant is not one, and I really hope it doesn't win. Does DiCaprio deserve the nomination? He was one of the better things in this film, and playing such a role must have pushed him to his physical limits, so maybe he does. Frankly, he's massively overdue one so for God's sake just give the man an Oscar and let's forget this absurd study in masculine pride ever existed.Harrowing storytelling with a gorgeous cinematic backdrop, The Revenant is not for the faint of heart but will stick with those who make the journey. Since the first trailers of this movie came out I knew it would be an experience. Following the incredible Birdman, director Alejandro G. Iñárritu had the public anxiously awaiting his interpretation of this bleak survival story, and much like Birdman, Iñárritu is also the star of this film. The Revenant has some of the most beautiful cinematography I've ever seen. It's cold, visceral, and almost entirely authentic from the use of natural lighting to the barebones yet powerful storytelling. You can tell Iñárritu poured his heart into this project and it pays off tremendously. This is not to discount the incredible performances of DiCaprio and Hardy (DiCaprio finally getting his well-overdue Oscar), but it's hard to imagine the movie being so impactful had another director been at the helm.  The story is as simple as it gets. In the 1800s, a group of settlers escape an ambush by an indigenous tribe, and during their travels one man gets separated from the group and gets brutally attacked by a wild bear and subsequently left for dead by his team. It's a revenge story more than anything. What it also highlights is human perseverance and the will to live. The things that happen to this man are truly horrific and difficult to watch. I'm not sure what parts of the story were embellished or Hollywoodized, but this film sucks you into this world and puts you right alongside this fatally wounded man desperate to survive. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a heart-wrenching performance as Hugh Glass, expressing a wide range of emotions despite the limited dialogue. Tom Hardy is also phenomenal as one of the most vile, wretched human beings on the planet. This guy is despicable to the core, and you forget you're watching Tom Hardy at times because he's completely absorbed in the role. The supporting cast is great as well despite their small time on screen. As far as performances and cinematography goes, The Revenant is flawless. What prevents this from getting a perfect 10 is one particular storyline that I didn't think was needed, and it involves the wife of Hugh Glass. She's never developed as a character but she appears intermittently in visions and dreams and it almost sucks you out of the movie for a second because of how intense the main narrative is. But this is a very small gripe. From beginning to end this movie had me on the edge of my seat, my jaw on the floor and my eyes glued to the screen. The Revenant is definitely not for everyone, but it's impossible not to appreciate it for the breathtaking cinematic achievement that it is.The Emperor is well and truly naked Utter, utter, utter, utter, waste of 2.5 hours of my life. One of the most boring films I've seen. Unintelligible dialogue and no real story. Leonardo Di Caprio is a fine actor and should have been given an Oscar for Wolf of Wall Street instead of this tripe, where he hardly has to act. OK, the conditions were harsh, but not as harsh as having to sit in a cinema and watch this. Tom Hardy was mumbling, as ever, and seemed to be a baddie for the sake of it. After an hour I was looking round the cinema to see if anyone else was as bored as I was. Di Caprio's character, Glass, is mauled, constantly frozen and wet, starved, dehydrated, witnesses (in his delirium) his son being murdered and rides off a cliff and yet I didn't really sense the suffering. Bilge.Stunningly awful I was hoping for something a bit more interesting than Hollywood's standard approach to cowboys and indians, especially as the film seems to have been critically acclaimed and Leo is a great actor.  The quality of the camera-work is excellent and the bear mauling scene very accomplished if that is the right way to describe such a visceral few minutes. But oh the plot. If you try to take it seriously it fails utterly. As an Indiana Jones caper it lacks wit. Too often you say 'I know he'd be dead from hypothermia/blood loss etc etc in any possible world but I'll just keep watching in case something interesting happens'. You ride your horse over a 150 foot drop, fall into a tree, and survive. You travel downstream in an icy river in your fur coat and don't drown/freeze. You manage to light a fire even when you are 9/10ths dead, there are no branches and you're flint went a few scenes ago. What a relief when the baddie is finally left to his fate, but then you realise you've just wasted 2 hours of your life.Why is The Revenant a darned lousy movie? Let me count the ways (As e-mailed to my few relatives, to impart the fair warning not to see this silly and execrable film.) Just saw Revenant movie with open caption last night. I bought a ticket to Kung Fu Panda 3 that plays at the same time as the movie. I may see it in hypocrisy to protest the idiot ["pendejo"] director's soap box politics. But at least I refused to pay FOR the movie directly, so they don't get my money, so there's that. As for my opinion: Terribly overrated. It's ridiculous, pretentious, inanely contrived (esp. protagonist's dead Indian wife), frequently dull and thematically &amp; aesthetically anemic with one-dimensional characters especially the villains who hammed it up. There is absolutely no point in this movie.  It is offensively politically didactic to the audience on race relations between Amerindians and whites, as if patronizing the audience by the director's self- important mockery, which felt overbearing with his overkill directorial style, like "Look at this, look at me, isn't this pretty, great job (cinematographer buddy) Chivo!" Some shots are irritating with "in your face" close-ups. There is absolutely no tension throughout the movie because of over-directing that is so palpably annoying it kills the enjoyment with occasional dull pacing in paper-thin plot structure.  There are unintentionally laughable scenes that require suspension of disbelief like CGI animals (not just the mauling bear) and swimming in the icy-cold river wearing bear fur coat with no adverse hypothermia effect (frozen to popsicle afterwards in twenty degree temperature). It's like a nature action movie with lack of logic as seen from Hollywood perspective. As for Leonardo's acting, it's really nothing to write home about. It's all method acting aided by the cold and chilly air that affect the actor to nearly and almost overact. I really didn't think his acting Oscar is due for this movie. It's a pity award.  The movie drags way too long. An hour could be cut and nothing would be lost. Pretentious filmmakers think length equals depth, but it's the opposite. They are very shallow in preconception, heavy on sensationalism (some scenes obviously pretentious as if the director is a show-off) and light on logic and reasonable pacing. Inarritu is a total hack who pretends to be an intellectual when he is not, instead he mugs as if he's on par with Kubrick. Cinematography is the only thing that's good about the movie, but still an awfully pretentious movie with no point to comprehend. I checked my watch more than a few times during the movie. It's how restless I felt. Gore doesn't phase me, but Inarritu's directing is the worst and most irritating factor about this movie.  George Miller is very calm, controlled and serenely self-assured in commanding direction in contrast to Inarritu's desperately provocative and bore-you-to-death pretentious approach to filmmaking.  That Miller lost best direction Oscar to this sentimental and lecturing hack Inarritu says a lot about the idiocy of Hollywood. Don't bother because it's so long and indulgent with pretension that Leo's subtly Oscar-bait overreaching method acting cannot compensate for how lousy this movie is, in terms of demerits.  What a piece of crap.  * out of fourWhat a waste of time to watch something so unreal! Unbelievable bad movie! I mean come on, i watched Titanic, and the same guy dies of Hypotermia in 5 minutes of cold water!!! ***spoiler*** Now he not only sleeps on the snow while totally ruined and left to death after a bear attack, he crawls for miles, take swims in a river with snow and ice around, get outside, sleeps a bit more then make a fire from a spark, on the snow, then kill some, then fall off the cliff with a horse and then he shows that he knows how Han Solo saved Luke on planet Hoth from dying. It could be such a good movie if bear killed him at the start. Or at least i wouldn't have wasted so much time watching it...Cold, colorless, dismal, stark, bleak, brutal, dispiriting &amp; ultimately pointless. In real life, Hugh Glass was mauled by a grizzly &amp; left for dead, but managed to drag himself back to a frontier outpost. The cinematic handling of the story in Revenant, however, is straight out of Cormac McCarthy: heavy-handed with funereal music &amp; gray-scale tones throughout, creating an overall impression that the sun rarely ever shone in those mountains in those times. Just watching it becomes a test of endurance. Cold, colorless, dismal, stark, bleak, brutal, dispiriting &amp; ultimately pointless. Perhaps that was how these men actually lived their lives? Maybe that's the point? If there is one? At the end of the film, we're left not even knowing whether Glass, after exacting vengeance on the man who killed his son, lives or dies himself. Or perhaps that doesn't matter? Perhaps none of it matters? Ptui! Worst film I've watched since Deadman.Almost un-bearable pain I went to see "The Revenant" on the day that it was nominated for 12 Oscars, which certainly sets the expectation that it is going to be good – and it is. But I saw it described by DiCaprio as an "epic art-house western" and that's a good description. In the same way that Iñárritu's "Birdman" (this time last year) was unarguably a brilliant but not very mainstream film, so I think the Oscar buzz will attract a big audience to this movie who may find it a struggle to really enjoy. Because it is bleak unremittingly bleak, in terms of the landscape, the weather and the motives of the characters. It is also extremely violent but, unlike "The Hateful Eight" (another film I saw this week that was unremittingly bleak) the violence is much more gritty, realistic and visceral making the drama a lot more compelling. DiCaprio plays "Hugh Glass", an historical figure who was a legendary fur-trapper in the early 1800's and the central figure in this bear-related yarn. Although the story has been re-embroidered over the years, the 'facts' align with the film's basic story (there's a good "Daily Telegraph" article outlining this - see the link on bob-the-movie-man.com). Attacked and pursuing by local natives, Glass's party is striking across woodland when he is viciously attacked by a 500lb Grizzly bear. Although appearing mortally wounded, he is a highly respected individual and so is stretchered up by his boss Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). Unable to proceed further, Henry pays for the mercenary John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) to stay with him, together with his half-Pawnee son Hawk and friend Bridger (Will Poulter), to die in peace. Predictably, Fitzgerald is not to be trusted, and Glass is abandoned in a shallow grave. If this is not enough, for other reasons we won't go into, Glass has even less inclination to keep his fellow trapper on his Christmas card list. Thus is set up a classic revenge movie, with Glass determined to stay alive to enact that revenge despite the enormous odds stacked against him. This is surely DiCaprio's year for his elusive Oscar as he turns in a cripplingly painful performance. It is clear that the suffering on screen is not all acting – it cannot be, given the inhospitable conditions in which the crew were filming (in Canada and Argentina). As examples he had to eat raw bison liver as well as suffering a much discussed Han "I thought they smelled bad on the outside" Solo moment. Despite having very few lines to deliver, DiCaprio is on screen for 90% of the time, and it is a bravura performance. Tom Hardy – also Oscar nominated – is also impressive as the villain of the piece, although for most of the time his lines might have well been delivered through his Bain mask for the sense they made. He is an inveterate mumbler. Domhnall Gleeson's performance is also compelling, adding a degree of goodness and compassion to the film that was so missing from "The Hateful 8". (Gleeson is surely vying this year with Ben Whishaw for the busiest mainstream film appearances after this, "Ex Machina", "Brooklyn" and "Star Wars"). Finally Will Poulter gets a chance to shine in an A-grade mainstream dramatic movie and he well and truly makes that grade. Director Alejandro G. Iñárritu has to be commended for eschewing the use of green screens, insisting on live performances and in natural light to boot. Stylistically (and indeed story-wise) the film has many parallels with "Gladiator", with its effective and artistically constructed dream sequences. But the film is not without special effects, and these are phenomenal, most incredibly delivered during the relentless and gruelling bear attack scene: a seamless blend of live animal work and effects that make it horrifically believable. There is also some fantastic camera work (by Emmanuel Lubezki) of the "how the hell did they do that variety". Recalling his work in "Birdman" it's challenging to do single tracking shots of people walking through buildings. To do these same tracking shots during a pitched battle scene is just phenomenal. During one scene in this harrowing sequence at the film's start, the camera is on the ground filming a native galloping towards a victim, then the camera is seamlessly filming the rider as he gallops away. Astonishing. The only area I really didn't care for was the music, by Carsten Nicolai and Ryuichi Sakamoto. A combination of droning strings and (later) some whiny "Ligeti-style" elements, it was in turns intrusive, gloomy and annoying. Music should largely stay in the background to set the mood. This didn't. Overall, this is a masterful film, but it is a slog and not a feel-good film to sit through. It also has significant violence which might not suit all viewers, with the final confrontation in particular being one of the most visceral fight scenes I've seen in years. By the way (I had to look it up) the definition of "revenant" is: noun  1. a person who returns 2. a person who returns as a spirit after death; ghost. Now you know too – this public service announcement brought to you by One Mann's Movies! (Please visit the graphical version of this review at http://bob-the-movie-man.com. Thanks.)Stunning Go and see this movie. In the cinema. As soon as possible. Simply put, it is an excellent story of family, revenge, survival, and nature. The Revenant is one of the most beautifully-shot films I have ever seen. I lost count of how many scenes I sat there in utter amazement, which is undoubtedly due to the brilliant directing and spectacular cinematography: there's no shaky-cam, no quick-cut editing, and a lot of incredibly complex shots which appear to have been completed in a single take. If all films were shot similarly to how the Revenant is, then the movie industry would drastically improve. The entire cast did a phenomenal job and they all deserve recognition for their performances; however, if Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't win an Oscar for his breathtaking portrayal of Glass then that will be the single biggest injustice of the year. Do not miss the opportunity to see this masterpiece on the big screen! UPDATE: I've read an unnerving amount of other user's reviews complaining about the plot. I can understand that the plot may seem a little basic or perhaps lacking at times; however, the plot is not what makes this film so excellent, and I feel as though those who failed to recognise this have seriously missed out. You don't just watch the Revenant: you experience it. Every single element from the music to the cinematography is cleverly concocted to draw you into the film and put you alongside the cast in the brutal wintry conditions. If you've not been drawn in due to being too concerned with the premise of the story, then I fear you've missed a truly enthralling and one-of-a-kind cinematic experience. UPDATE TWO: Leo won the Oscar!Unbelievable and way overrated I cannot believe how many people think this is a good movie....watching a guy struggle to survive for 2 hours ...come on people..I know there are not many good movies being made but my word....so many things are unbelievable...the bear attack, carrying a near dead guy out of the wilderness up a mountain...going over a cliff on a horse and not getting hurt...spending long periods of time in freezing cold water.....surviving extreme cold overnight inside a dead horse...my god the list is endless....and for Leo's so called acting don't get me started...a lot of crawling and moaning and groaning....the whole thing was a letdown and really a waste of time...also tell the director to back the camera up a bit on those facial close-ups...they were also ridiculous...trust me save your money and go see The Hateful Eight.Eyecandy "The Revenant" is probably the most beautiful movie I have seen for a long time. This is not only due to the incredible locations, but also to the excellent (and by excellent I mean excellent) camera-work. Frequently I was just blown away by the sheer beauty of the rough terrain of Canada and how it was captured by the crew. However, there are a few drawbacks. Mainly the story (it is a very simple revenge story line) and the dialog (it is basically not existent :D). When I first left the movie I was still blown away by all the great things I mentioned above (I was thinking about a 10/10 rating), but the longer I was outside the movie the more I recognized that "The Revenant" is a film that is incredible entertaining whilst sitting in the cinema, but also a movie I quickly forgot about when being at home again. Still, the movie is definitely a must-see. Your money is well invested!A bit too much and a very unbelievable story. I honestly don't know what to think of this movie. It's good in a way and at the same time awful. To begin with, the idea to the story is interesting. It's set in the 19th century which makes the scenario more complicated than it would be today. But then there is this whole father/son scenario which really makes no sense and seems out of place. There is some back story to it that is scattered out through the film and I understand it's there to add some tension to the movie, but there is no build up to make you feel anything about it and in the end it seems boring and pointless. It is well made though and most of the scenes seems very real and believable. I sometimes grasped the chair grinning cause I really felt the reality and pain in it. The bear attack for one stands out. The acting is very good and the actors do as much as they can with the script they're given, but as much as I believe Di Caprio deserves an Oscar, I really don't think this role was the one. The plot could have been more interesting. It looks a bit like they tried to make another "Deliverance" but failed in character development and gravity of the story. Along the way I lost interest since everything seemed to be based around how everything in the wild hurts, and the main character is hurt a lot. Still he seems to survive anything that happens to him, sometimes in the most obscure ways. At the end I didn't really care whether or not he was going to make it back home, even less if he was going to be able to avenge his son, because nothing felt dangerous anymore. I was just hoping for the movie to end because it felt way too long. They could easily have made this an hour shorter which I think would have made it more exciting and less dragged out. Warning! Spoilers ahead! There were a number of things bothering me about this movie but what bothered me the most is that there is a huge lack of credibility throughout some parts of it, especially since it's supposed to be based on real events:  Mostly I was annoyed by the fact that he seems to take any chance he has to jump into the water and have a swim. Everyone who has been living in a place cold enough for it to snow during the winter knows that falling into ice-cold water when it's that cold outside, is equal to freezing to death if you don't manage to get out of your clothes and get warm somehow. Yet he barely seems to freeze at all. It's snowing and there are ice floes in the water for God's sake! In reality he would have been dead by the time he reached the riverbank, and certainly after his "nap". Seems like the movie makers forgot to do some research about hypothermia.  After the bear attack his foot is clearly broken and points in the wrong direction. Yet he manages to crawl off and swim down the rapids in ice-cold water only to be able to walk out of the river on his now miraculously healed foot.  The only problem to him surviving seems to be the injuries he suffered from the bear attack. I mean he even rides off a cliff and survives the fall only to miraculously survive yet another cold night of snow storms. Why do they eat raw meat when they clearly have made a fire two steps away where they could cook it? It makes no sense. All the lines delivered by the native Americans seemed out of sync for some reason, which is weird since todays technology in syncing picture and audio is quite developed. All in all it's an interesting story but a bit boring and unbelievable way to tell it. I would have bought it if it was a fictional story, but this time it's based on real events. If you want to revel in pain, suffering and misery, and if you like to watch a movie about how hard it was back in the 19th century, please go ahead, but there are better ways to spend your money.Don't waste your time What a waste of a night. Spoiler alert! Here is the whole movie in 30 seconds. A guy almost dies, a guy walks, a guy builds a fire, the guy almost dies again, walks some more, goes for a swim, builds a fire, almost dies, goes for a swim again, builds a fire, makes it back safely, goes back out again, finds a fire, almost dies, makes someone else go for a swim. Looks into the camera deeply. The end. Best supporting actor to the bear. My life would have been better had you finished the job. I'm pretty sure this script was two pages long, and they turned it into a 2.5 hour movie. The closed captioning graphic artist had more words than any one else in the movie.Un rêve? Non! I made the mistake of reading up on the life of the real Hugh Glass (the character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio) before seeing the film. What I saw on-screen was a very distorted/Hollywoodized version of his story with lots of unnecessary racism thrown in (because, you know, Hollywood just can't pass up the chance to bash Whitey whenever possible). Inarritu takes a simple survival story and turns it into a violent, gory revenge story. Sensationalism for the sake of sensationalism abounds. So do clichés. There is some speculation that the real Hugh Glass may have married a Pawnee Indian woman during a period (which ended a couple of years before the events depicted in the film) when he lived with the tribe. However, there is no surviving documentation, either public records or correspondence to/from Glass, that mentions a wife. In the film, Glass has a Pawnee wife who we see in flashbacks getting murdered by an evil, White soldier because, you know, White people are horrible and Hollywood wants you to know that. The real Hugh Glass had no children. Movie-Glass has a half-Indian son who he coaches to act "invisible" because the (racist) White men they work with will only see his skin color. His son later gets murdered by an evil, White man because, you know, White people are awful and Hollywood wants to make sure you understand that. Real-Glass never killed an army officer. Movie-Glass, it is revealed in flashbacks, once killed an evil, White lieutenant who was trying to murder his very young son because, you know, White people are just terrible and Hollywood will not let you forget that. Real-Glass did not rescue a woman during his arduous journey back to the fort. Movie-Glass not only rescues an Indian woman but he rescues her while she's being raped by an evil, White, French guy because, you know, White people (no matter where they're from) are just horrid and Hollywood will remind you of that as often as possible. Real-Glass was helped along on his odyssey by some friendly Sioux Indians, none of whom were killed by White people in the process. Movie-Glass is helped by one Indian who is later murdered by evil, White, Frenchmen because, you know, White people are reprehensible and in case you still weren't sure yet Hollywood will BLUDGEON YOU OVER THE HEAD WITH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!!! Fabricating a bunch of racist scenarios in order to move the story along and provide impetus for the main character is cheap and lazy screen-writing. Real-Glass did not get any revenge on John Fitzgerald, other than getting his rifle back. Movie-Glass gets a very violent, bloody revenge. Real-Glass eventually let go of his anger and forgave Bridger and Fitzgerald. Movie-Glass has a weird quasi-redemption where he stops short of finishing Fitzgerald off but then sends him on to certain death at the hands of another. So, is that redemption, really? The film goes way overboard depicting Glass as a super-man. I'm sure men were made of sturdier stuff back in the 1820s but when he and the horse hit that tree I just thought, "Oh, COME ON!!" The guy wasn't even fully recovered from getting mauled (and rolled on) by a 300-400 pound grizzly bear yet! And, no, he did not fall off a cliff in real life. Did I mention that the bear attack actually happened in August and Glass reached the fort in October? So, there was no crawling through snow or wading through icy water in freezing temperatures either. How would he not have hypothermia and/or frostbite after weeks of that?! Movie-Glass occasionally has dreams where he hears his dead wife murmuring analogies about trees because nothing screams, "This movie is really, really deep!" like whispered dream-guidance from a dead Native-American. Yes, there is lots of striking cinematography of beautiful scenery. Much has been made of the fact that Inarritu used only natural light and it does work well with the tone of the film. The bear attack is both impressive and horrifying. If you know anything about how to react to a bear attack you will cringe in horror at Glass' stupidity. (Note to screenwriter: bears HIBERNATE in the Winter!) The music is good. I was surprised that DiCaprio won the Golden Globe and I'll be disappointed if he wins the Oscar. He gives a good performance in the film but I just don't think it's an Oscar-caliber role. "The Revenant" is sensational but not in a good way.Wish it was as good as they say it is. I went into this movie with high expectations. I came out feeling like i'd just sat through a long funeral for someone I didn't know, on a hot and humid day.  *********MASSIVE SPOILERS******** I BASICALLY DESCRIBE THE WHOLE MOVIE IN DETAIL ********* The movie started out great with a little action scene and a little bit about the main character (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his son. After that, with very little else about the story or anything to tie viewers into it, DiCaprio is mauled by a bear because for some reason he's in the forest alone after just being raided and destroyed by some Indian tribe, who are looking for some random girl. (maybe i'm missing something but that's about all I took from the beginning of the movie) So the rest of the "Americans" come and rescue DiCaprio from underneath the bear he just killed after it nearly mauled him to death, and for some reason he survives even though in reality he'd probably had lost enough blood at that point to kill three people. The rest of the middle of the movie is watching DiCaprio breathe heavily and crawl around the forest floor with some cinematic shots of snow, and listening to Tom Hardy attempt to cover up his terrible accent by speaking as low as possible. Oh and did I mention DiCaprio has an Indian kid? Yea so he has a kid, the kids mom and tribe was massacred by Americans or French or something like that, and DiCaprio is really close to the kid and vice versa. (Yes it's the predictable average story of revenge) So Tom Hardy kills DiCaprio's kid because the kid doesn't want him to kill his father. Then they leave DiCaprio behind to die (BUT GUESS WHAT??? THE MAIN CHARACTER DIDN'T DIE! WOW! DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE COMING) so he regains strength, gets some support from some random Indian dude who also lost his family, but to another tribe, and then some French dudes who have the girl the other tribe is looking for, find and kill the other Indian dude, but don't see DiCaprio apparently even though he was in a giant wood shelter with a fire going. DiCaprio becomes hero and saves the girl, kills some french dudes, and rides off to get his "revenge" And you know what happens next?? HE GETS HIS REVENGE!@!!!@#!@ WOW WEE WHAT AN ADVENTURE  Movie ends with the Indian tribe who got their girl back finishing off Tom Hardy with a hatchet or knife, and they walk past Leo and leave him alone.  Seriously though, I don't understand the hype around this movie. It WAS Oscar bait, because 90% of the movie is Leo breathing heavy, acting as injured and in pain as possible crawling around grunting and moaning.  The only good thing about the movie was the cinematic shots and scenes, but nothing else. Insanely bland and generic story with a good setting.  I actually like most of DiCaprio's movies, and I think he should've had an Oscar a long time ago, but I don't feel it should be for this movie.What's a beautiful plate with nothing on it? If ever there was a case of style over substance, The Revenant is it. Visually stunning, yes, but films have always been about more than that. If something nice to look at is what you want, go and stare at a painting or a photo for 2 and a half hours. This isn't a bad film in the way that Adam Sandler films are bad, it's a bad film because there is nothing (bar the visuals) to enjoy. It is so unrelentingly grim, with zero character development, It left me asking, am I meant to care? As the film opens with the slaughter of half the group, it's a pretty brutal scene, but with no impact, as we weren't even introduced to them. This serves as a recurring problem throughout the running time. The only thing interesting thing about this movie is that it serves as a metaphor for DiCaprio's own struggle to earn an Oscar. His character goes through so much Hell to survive, has everything thrown at him, and its' almost like Leo is pleading to the Academy - 'Look, look! See what I'm willing to put myself though?!'To be fair, it paid off in that respect.Linear survival tale in which revenge becomes secondary I haven't seen all of Alejandro González Iñárritu's films. Those I have seen were excellent or at least very good: "Amores Perros", "21 Grams", "Babel" and "Birdman". When I saw the trailer for "The Revenant", needless to say, I immediately thought it had tremendous potential and got pretty hyped up about it. It showed gorgeous, naturally-lit cinematography, dynamic directing, a historical depiction of the early 19th century savagery, and what seemed to be quite a visceral performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. I thought that, with Iñárritu's name attached to it, this would be a much deeper film than what I ended up watching, at least in its depictions of history, first nations, and in its ability to exploit classic themes such as revenge and survival. Without saying that "The Revenant" is an empty shell (although a gorgeous one), Iñárritu's film fails to impress when it comes to depth, thanks to a linear and predictable narrative structure, one dimensional characters, and a revenge plot that never manages to be compelling to the audience. DiCaprio offers a demanding, physical performance with very little dialogue, but his character, always in survival mode, never reached me emotionally. All the agony grunting and wincing, enhanced by the costumes and make up sure make the character believable, but the script never allows the character to develop or to unfold anything that goes beyond an extremely narrow range of emotions. Very unfortunate. Tom Hardy is okay as the antagonist, another character that suffers from his development being jilted by the writers. This is an unfortunate mistake to make in a revenge-themed film, where the antagonist is supposed to nourish the quest. In "The Revenant", the antagonist is barely a background character that will leave the audience almost emotionless and neutral. The directing (Alejandro González Iñárritu) and cinematography (Emmanuel Lubezki) are the highlights here. Visually, "The Revenant" is flawless. The framing of the shots, the camera movements and the snowy, low-saturation imagery are all gorgeous. Some scenes are absolutely incredible to watch. Editing-wise, Stephen Mirrione could have cut a few corners here and there. And this is coming from a movie enthusiast who sure appreciates a slow-paced film. Watching Hugh Glass walk through the endless forest was great, but you do see at least a dozen very-low angle shots of trees. They're just as beautiful as they're eerie, but slightly redundant at times.  Overall, "The Revenant" is not a bad film. It just isn't a great one either. It does have its moments. Definitely a case of style over substance, "The Revenant" disappoints both as a revenge tale and as a meditation on the savagery of both man and nature. Plot-wise, its flaws keep "The Revenant" in a linear survival tale in which revenge becomes secondary. Too bad.Silly and painfully dull Okay, okay, it's not really a one out of ten, more like a three, but the overall score is way too high and needs compensating. As many other reviewers have noted the acting and cinematography are uniformly excellent. Otherwise, it's both boring and ludicrous. The first twenty minutes are pretty good, but after the bear attack it becomes both silly and tedious. Indeed it's sillier than the film where Liam Neeson gets chased around the wilderness by a pack of wolves, and at least that was quite exciting. The biggest problem by far was that the DiCaprio character continued to live. In sub zero temperatures if any human, but especially one that's been severely weakened, is plunged into freezing water and then is unable to get dry he will die of hypothermia. What he won't be able to do is go back into the freezing water in order to build a horseshoe of rocks under the water so he can trap fish. This was just one instance of many. A horse's chest cavity is simply not big enough to accommodate a fully grown man, Leo fires his barrel loading pistol twice in quick succession which is impossible. Then there were all the continuity problems. Leo gets washed downstream but appears to arrive at a location which is at a higher altitude. Sometimes there's lots of snow on the trees, then in the next shot barely any snow at all. It's just a mess. But the worst thing was how long it took to achieve relatively little. Just lots of suffering for DiCaprio and boredom for me.Literally nothing new It is a travesty. The scenery shots are boring and carelessly tacked on to create a disparity between the violence and serenity of nature I assume but it's really badly done. I think it's supposed to be arty? If you watch the trailer, google some pics of Canadian landscape and youtube that scene from star wars with the tauntaun you have basically watched the movie. Don't waste your money. It is soulless Oscar fodder and brings nothing new to cinema so if you want to watch the same old story of a guy surviving against all odds because revenge and manpain are powerful driving forces, go for it. You'll probably enjoy it. If you want to watch something with beautiful editing or scenery or costume design, there are way better films out there that do all of this a lot better and have a more original storyline/progressive way of showing that storyline. I found it very dull and Leo does not deserve an Oscar. Maybe Tom Hardy does. But Mad Max was better so he should win it for that.Now I wish the bear did a better job How can I reconcile the great reviews that film critics and many (actually a majority as far as I can see) on IMDb have given this movie? Easy! Anyone who likes this film is also a fan of the Rocky films. Just like Sylvester Stallone, Leonardo di Caprio gets off the mat after a near lights-out experience and goes on to defeat the enemy of the time. That's all there is, folks - Rocky in the Rockies! Unfortunately, Rocky movies were far less boring than this steaming pile that Iñárritu has deposited (again after Birdman). Is there something worse than mere boredom? Yes there is. Tom Hardy's portrayal of a cleft palate requires subtitles to decipher what the hell is this character's problem. Sorry Americans but some of you really don't render the English language in a way the rest of the world understands it. How did this performance ever get the Best Supporting Actor Oscar? In fact, how did Leonardo di Caprio get his best actor award? I suspect that it was for The Wolf of Wall Street and not this orgy of grunts and crawling out of dead horses and freezing rivers. I might have given The Revenant a better rating for the cinematography as the movie lovingly portrays the Canadian Rockies. This movie was given an award for Best Achievement in Cinematography. Sometimes the Academy does the Right Thing. That being said, maybe they should have just made a travel documentary instead. At the end of The Revenant, I was cheering for the bear at the beginning of the movie. Perhaps if the she-bar had really finished off Leonardo's character, I wouldn't have wasted my time.Some people go for a walk in the woods. Story line: Some people go for a walk in the woods.

The end.Honest filmmaking and incredible wide angle cinematic detail Smooth camera-work, long takes, wide angle, natural light, great cast and costumes. The story takes us on a journey and puts us right there in the harsh conditions. In full HD on a nicely calibrated display, you are in for a treat. I love it when cinema isn't pretentious. The camera isn't hiding anything, it's simply showing the scene and background as it exists. This movie achieves a direct signal to the viewer. Uncontaminated, unfiltered, very few gimmicks, genuine and poetic. The only part I felt went a bit too far into fiction territory was the horse over the cliff scene. A bit too Hollywood, but forgivable. Everyone involved in making this film are very lucky to be part of such a special motion picture.Beautiful and Terrifying Beautiful. All the elements of filmmaking were outstanding. It was very tense. Leonardo DiCaprio is great. Tom Hardy is great. The one takes were cool, especially with its one takes. The action scenes were incredibly tense, violent and gory. The make-up, visual effects, costumes, acting, cinematography and directing were phenomenal.The Revenant Review I'm probably going to get some flak for the rating I am giving The Revenant, but I didn't think it was as good as everyone said it was. Stick around and see why. Synopsis: While exploring the uncharted wilderness in 1823, legendary frontiersman Hugh Glass sustains injuries from a brutal bear attack. When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home while avoiding natives on their own hunt. Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald, the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him. Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy Director: Alejandro G. Inarritu Okay, if anyone knows the real story of this movie is based off of, then you know that Hugh Glass did not exact his revenge on the men who left him for dead. First thing, it wasn't the dead of winter when he was mauled, it was actually in the middle of the summer. His son wasn't killed by anyone, his son actually lived a full life. These are just two of the many things that have been changed. As I do understand why the film makers took the liberties with the story, I don't think they needed to take it that far. And truthfully, that is the main reason I gave the movie a 7. The reason I gave it a 7 is because of how slow paced the movie was. Although it added to the tone of the movie, it just played out too long. The movie was only two and a half hours long, but until the last thirty minutes it felt like four hours. Adding that I constantly had to keep lowering and raising my volume didn't help. There are a lot of good things though. Even though I didn't like the changes they did make to the story, I still love this story. I wish they would have kept it the real ending where Glass forgave the two men who left him. But, the story is still a tale of survival. The man had to go through a lot to walk up to the men and say what he had to say. Alejandro is a great director. I absolutely love his movies, especially Babel and Biutiful. This is probably one of his not so good movies, but still better than most of his movies. Can't wait to see what he has next. Do I think Leo deserved the Oscar for this movie? No I don't. Tom on the other hand should have won. He stole the show, once again. I honestly think the Academy gave Leo the award for all the years they passed him up. He did a decent job in this movie, but he didn't do anything to extreme like he has done in movies like Wolf of Wall Street, The Aviator, Gangs of New York, or The Departed. Geez, I never realized he deserved the Oscar for movies he did with Scorsese Final Thoughts: Even though I don't like the idea of them changing the story quite a bit I do believe this movie is a watchable movie, hands down.  Rating: 7 out of 10"The Revenant" leaves audiences stunned, unsettled by grizzly, authentic portrayal Icy water trickles gently over the rocks. All is quiet. As the camera tilts up and pans to the right, the barrel of a gun creeps out from behind a tree. Two armed hunters are now visible, moving with caution over the steady flow of the stream. A nearby gunshot shatters the calm. The men stop. Another shot. Screams of terror and fury fill the air as the two men return to their hunting party. Arikara Indians gallop around the camp of fur trappers. Their arrows whiz past the two men, piercing the skulls of others around them. A small group of survivors flees the Arikara. Reaching a boat offshore, the remaining trappers drift down the Missouri River, battered and defeated, carrying only a fraction of the beaver furs they'd trapped over the past few months. This opening scene from "The Revenant" captures the brutality exhibited in the true story of its protagonist Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), a legendary frontiersman and fur trapper in the 1820s. Following the slaughtering of trappers at the beginning of the film, Glass guides the surviving group back to its outpost, Fort Kiowa. As Glass is scouting ahead he is attacked by a grizzly bear and mauled to the edge of death. Finding Glass underneath the dead beast, captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) leaves him in the care of his half-native son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) and John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), as it seems that Glass will succumb to his wounds. After a failed attempt to smother Glass, Fitzgerald kills Hawk, buries Glass alive and deceives Bridger about his actions as they press on toward Fort Kiowa. Determined to find Fitzgerald, Glass uses his wit and skill to survive and sets out on a 200-mile path of vengeance across the Northern Plains of America, and you are with him every step of the way. You squirm in your seat as Glass cauterizes his own wounds. You taste the blood and scales of the raw fish as Glass rips it open with his teeth. You lose your appetite for that next handful of popcorn as Glass guts a horse and uses its carcass as a sleeping bag.  The authenticity of "The Revenant" is not only the product of DiCaprio's dedication, but also of the entire cast and crew. Director Alejandro G. Inarritu was unwavering about filming in strictly natural light, which gave the cast and crew a mere 90 minutes of shooting time each day. Inarritu and his team journeyed for hours in minus 25 degree weather to locations in the Canadian and Argentinian mountains. The production ran five months over schedule and $35 million over budget, but the hell that the cast and crew endured was not in vain. The cinematography is masterful. The close ups are so close at times that DiCaprio's breath fogs up the lens, further intensifying the emotional impact of his performance. The landscape choices and use of all natural light result in breathtaking shots such as one scene when Fitzgerald and Bridger are keeping warm by the fire. As darkness falls, sparks dance upward off of the flames; the camera angle shows them gently float toward the heavens and vanish into the twinkling of the night sky. "The Revenant" is nominated for 12 Academy Awards, the most at this year's ceremony. Its direction is nearly flawless, its performances, unsettling. But above all, Inarritu paints a captivating portrait of human suffering and the incredible resiliency of a man with a heart of vengeance.Beautiful cinematography The visual is breathtaking and so most of my rating has gone on that aspect of the film. I felt the length of the film was too long for such a straightforward story-line. The acting was faultless, the setting gloomy but stunning and the period of history compelling but just far too long.Technically accomplished, but left me a bit cold. This is really more of a 6.5 out of 10, but maybe I'm just splitting hairs. The cinematography is amazing to the point of being distracting. It's as if Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu, upon realizing that we have the means to shoot a scene of Leonardo Dicaprio being mauled by a bear in extended, agonizing close-up, decided that every scene should be shot in that way. Maybe I'm overthinking things, but that ended up taking me out of the action. The bear is obviously CG, and since we know that director Innaritu and cinematographer Emmaneul Lubezki are using some digital trickery to make the whole thing appear to be one seamless shot, what's the point? I almost think that scene would have been more effective had it consisted of separate shots, so that a real bear could be employed in long shots, with cuts to a close-up of an animatronic paw crushing Leo or something like that. I should probably talk about the plot now. The story concerns a couple of fur trappers on the Western frontier in the 19th century, who are set upon by violent Natives and have to turn back. When one of them (Leonardo Dicaprio, resorting to masochistic extremes in order to win that Oscar) has a heated debate with a grizzly over which of them deserves to continue breathing, the group leaves him for dead. Tom Hardy plays another member of the trapper group, and he, rather than the bear, is the true villain of the piece. I won't give away what he does, suffice to say that if it weren't for his performance, my rating would be at least two stars lower. This isn't a bad movie. I know I'm being snarky, but it really isn't. That said, I liked Innaritu more when his head wasn't quite so far up his own ass. "Babel" might overreach somewhat, but it has a lot more to say than this bloated film. The scenes with Leo forced to fend for himself in the wilderness verge on misery porn. There is something inherently thrilling about watching people survive on limited resources (see "Castaway" for a superior example of this). This is the kind of film where I can admire certain parts more than I can say I like the whole. Those tracking shots are impressing, sure. There are some fantasy/dream sequences that are well-shot, but that I can't make head or tail of. The sheer physical torment that Dicaprio must have put himself through for this role is admirable, but then again, he was so much more fun in "The Departed". I just wish the film weren't so dead-set on being great that it sometimes forgets to be good.Boring This movie was so hyped but ended up rather boring. For most of the movie, nothing happens at all. It could have been 1-hour long and we wouldn't miss a thing. Di Caprio's performance was OK, but in my opinion he had many better movies, including Inception, Departed, Wolf of Wall Street... I think they gave him "Mercy Oscar" because he deserved it several times in the past, but didn't get it.Ending Great scenery but terribly gory! I. Liked the movie ending better as Glass gets his revenge! The ending is different in movie! Fitzgerald gets killed in movie as we see him floating down the river. However he gets away free in the book never to be seen again!! And even if it's an illusion Glass gets to see his wife again? I was wondering why Hollywood chose to have a son for Glass?Very intriguing Revenant, someone who has come back basically from the dead. This applies to many people in life that make a dramatic return when not being on the "scene" for a long period of time, as well as an emergence. A revenant is present in the movie business as well. Many actors dream of winning the coveted Academy Award. Despite being nominated for the award four times previously, Leonardo DiCaprio could never win one despite his most famous works. Some of those on the list include Titanic, Shutter Island, The Wolf of Wall Street, Django Unchained, Catch Me If You Can, The Great Gatsby, Inception, and even Romeo + Juliet. Nevertheless, he was able to achieve what many actors dream of, which is to capture an Academy Award. This would be his first, and for a movie made in 2015, which portrayed him in a whole different role than what he usually plays. This movie that is so hyped up is called "The Revenant." This is the tale of courage against the odds of nature, and the determination and grit that one gets from within. One thing to note, as well, is that this movie was based on a true story of an American frontiersman. There were many good movies worth noting in 2015, but none could compared to this one. Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, "The Revenant" is a must watch even though it was made it 2015 due to the awesome plot, the unbelievable acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, and the great cinematography showing the beautiful landscape of Argentina and Canada. The tale that Alejandro González Iñárritu got the attention of many audiences with the story of Hugh Glass. Surprisingly this is based on a true story that happened many, many years ago. The story may seem a bit cheesy with the fact that the protagonist overcomes many obstacles within nature. It is also a story of revenge, and Iñárritu reshapes the famed Hugh Glass to a character that everyone can get behind and support, sort of like Rudy. This movie also shows survival, which is captured as Glass does and many others did some actions that shows what one must do to survive in the wilderness. Iñárritu draws people to this story, and it hits people on an emotional level, which separates this movie from the competition. An actor as eloquent in his craft as Leonardo DiCaprio should be rewarded for nailing a role that was unlike others. The usual characters that DiCaprio portrays is the handsome stud, most of the time having a decent amount of money, that all the girls fall in love with and the guys are jealous of. This is true for his films like Romeo + Juliet, The Wolf of Wall Street, The Great Gatsby, Titanic, and Inception. In The Revenant, DiCaprio plays a scruffy, unattractive, wild frontiersman that at first glance looks nothing like the DiCaprio we all know. Playing this character also meant that doing some gross, gnarly stuff that a person would never imagine DiCaprio doing. Only a really strong actor can play roles that break their usual role norms, and this is what DiCaprio does to make The Revenant one of the best movies. Earth is such a beautiful place with many wonders all over, and Iñárritu captures them in South America and Canada. It is very noteworthy that the conditions in which the shots were filmed was inhospitable especially the parts in Canada. The movie was about a frontiersman and his survival in the wilderness, and the rough conditions were caught nicely. However, the beauty of the landscape was shown despite all the snow and mist. The last scenes that were shot in Argentina had to be the best I've seen in a while. Even though this was towards the end and not the main location like how Canada was, the landscape and the terrain that they filmed at were jaw droppingly good. Alejandro González Iñárritu captured both the beauty and the dark side of Mother Nature elegantly in this masterpiece that leaves audiences in awe. If you have never watched this movie, you must. It has aspects that almost everyone can enjoy whether you are intrigued by cinematography, an award-winning actor, or a compelling story.Very hard Leonardo DiCaprio First of all, Leonardo DiCaprio is very hard, very hard, in order to obtain the Oscar prize, even in this movie is ugly, black bear, if not for the eighty-eighth Oscar prize in Leonardo DiCaprio's words, is really Providence will not forgive after all he has worked hard for a long time. The film also can have a super fun, Chinese can release really is the gospel.'The Revenant' truly nails the battle between man and nature in what I believe will be one of the most studied films of the 21st century. Though the acting is undoubtedly some of the best I've seen from Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy (two of the finest actors alive today) the true stars of the film are its visionary cinematographer (Emmanuel Lubezki) and director (Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu), who between 'Birdman' (my favorite film of 2014) and 'The Revenant' have just rewritten the book on their perspective talents. I kept thinking to myself, "this looks like a Terrance Malick film", which has everything to do with Lubezki's work with Malick on the acclaimed 'The Tree of Life' and the grossly overlooked 'The New World', which remains my favorite historical love story to date. A warning to those squeamish towards violence, 'The Revenant' is brutal; placing the audience in the heart of the battle to the point where you can smell the death and decay. By contrast, I've never seen more breathtaking panoramic shots of nature on the silver screen. 'The Revenant' truly nails the battle between man and nature in what I believe will be one of the most studied films of the 21st century.Visually an Experience The Revenant is based in part on the exploits of Hugh Glass where we see Leonardo DiCaprio as Glass, a Scots-American soldier in the early 19th century. Glass has son (Forrest Goodluck) by an absent native woman, and something about this, or his basic authority, triggers the bitter resentment of fellow hunting party member John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). Quickly within several key moments of the film, wee see that Glass is suddenly mauled by a bear, and Fitzgerald wants to leave him behind. Later another member of the hunter's team Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) is somehow convinced to go along with that, although he later claims not to have understood Fitzgerald, and we believe him. The Renevant besides it's well visuals and great acting from the leads DiCaprio and Hardy, the films comes off rather boring and not as exciting or entertaining as a whole, as it is being praise for. Yes, the acting makes the film passable and the cinematography is well done, with great shots of the outside. Though in it's story arc, the film does not capitalize as it should. There were not many twists or turns which keeps the audience prepared and waiting for, unfortunately. Mainly due to the film's long running time (two hours 36 minutes), at certain points it becomes dull and almost predictable. The ending is quite well done, as expected.Piece of Art Personally i was aware what to expect going to the movies. Alejandro Iñárritu and Leonardo Di Caprio. The director who made some cinematic history with "Birdman" (besides the German one-take-movie Victoria"). On his side everybody's darling and environmentalist (Thank you for that!) Leo. I saw the teaser trailer and i was convinced: this will be big! The pictures: raw, visually stunning. The camera: supports calm, breathing and oppressive moments; follows impressive perspectives, for example an American Indian on his horse riding straight into a battle. The music: disturbing and overwhelming, cautious and imposing. Somewhere i heard, some find the film too brutal, too long, or say the story is too simple. I answer you this: The raw violence in this case is a great tool to show the suffer and the anger of the characters. The length of the movie is just fitting. It takes just as much time as it needs to lead you into a world of pain and the demand of vengeance. A desire which suppresses the hurt of loss, drives a man's ungovernable will to live, who believes that revenge is everything he has left. More to the simple" story: In beautiful, powerful and wordless scenes - the memories of our protagonist - lies a past soaked by identity and love, between treason and humanity. It's up to the audience to fill the gaps of Glass' past, it demands your full attention and emotions. Last but not least: The message, free to go. A confessing democratic will maybe question the proved judiciary seeing the loner with his vigilante justice. And someone who considers vengeance the same as punishment may will recognize that even revenge won't bring back any losses. So my advice is, take some time to watch this piece of art! Thanks! Need to mention - trivia: Leo ate real bison liver to be as much authentic as he can for his performance and the movie. The bear sequence is a cinematic highlight although in this age of CGI overloaded movies.Beautiful, brutal, gritty, dramatic, emotional The Revenant is the most beautiful film I have seen, all year. This film is the epitome of visual storytelling, this film is pure visual storytelling and it has beautiful cinematography, this film really blew me away and I was incredibly exited when I saw the trailer, It looked amazing and I was not disappointed. The acting in this film is more than just acting, they became these characters and I believed they were who they were portraying on screen. It was a beautiful experience watching this film because I knew a lot of effort was put into this film, everything from the directing, acting, cinematography, the score, the realism is on point and I love how everything came together and formed a beautiful piece of cinema. The film is directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Will Poulter, Domhnall Gleeson and Forrest Goodluck. As soon as I knew Emmanuel Lubezki was the cinematographer I already knew I was going to get a gorgeous film and all the actors were very strong and the director was also incredibly good so everything was already in place, it was destined for greatness. The camera-work in this film is so good, the camera flows through the scenes and you feel one with the film, It is incredibly well shot and scenes go on for the right amount of time and everything hits the right beats.

This film tells the story of a fur tradesman, Hugh Glass who gets abandoned by his group and has to witness get his son killed, when he gathers up enough strength he goes out to try and find the man who took away his son and almost his life. This film is as authentic as you can get with Hollywood film as every shot in this film is real, not CGI and they used natural lighting and used the natural resources they had with them, I find that incredible that a director would go through all that hassle just to make the film look as amazing as it does, props to the actors who has to perform under such terrible whether conditions (it was worth it as Leo got an Oscar, finally). The minimal dialogue in this film helps in building characters as you mostly get a lot of emotional expression through their acting and the visuals, a lot of it is visual, not very focused on the dialogues. This film is incredibly violent and brutal, you see this man fight against the forces of nature whilst also using it to find his way through the wilderness to eventually find the man he is after. The acting in this film is very well done. I just wish this film was shorter, it did feel stretched out a bit but apart from that this film is perfect for me. I definitely recommend to those who love beautiful looking films, you enjoy a gritty adventure film as well as a dramatic story about a man on a journey to avenge his sons death and reconnect with his group. The moment Leonardo meets Tom Hardy's character their fight scene is brutal and it is a bloody mess, you feel disgusting after watching this film because of how real it feels and how grotesque it is. The bear scene was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen, I am so confused by how they managed to achieve that effect but they did it and it looks great, I am so surprised by how amazingly well done this film is.  This film is beautiful, this is definitely cinematic history being made.Another Iñárritu masterpiece to follow 'Birdman.' Director Alejandro González Iñárritu, known most recently for directing "Birdman," has created a visually stunning movie of survival and revenge. It's clearly the fruit of much labor on behalf of the director and all the actors. It shows and works in the movie. Unfortunately the audience has to labor as well through a lot of slow scenes, some of which are probably unnecessary. The two main roles are played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy. Their characters are rough, gritty, and at times difficult to watch. There are some scenes in this film that made even me feel like hiding my eyes. Is this any surprise since this movie is about frontiersmen surviving in sub zero temperatures. There are Indians, hatchets, musket type rifles, buffalo, and bears. Aside: This film contains the most frightening bear maul I've ever seen on film. Even Paul Bunyan would recoil. Short synopsis: Hugh Glass is a frontiersman alongside Jon Fitzgerald and a group of rough ones. They are making their way through the snowy forest terrain. Through a course of events and a bear mauling of Hugh, the story becomes one of survival. Hugh is determined to survive the attack and take revenge on those who abandoned him for dead. My conclusions: There is a signature drum soundtrack but not as extensive as the one in "Birdman." The camera pans and zooms are also signature of Iñárritu. It's a long sit but I can say that fans of "Birdman" and westerns about revenge will probably really enjoy this movie. The cinematography is incredible. My wife and I actually felt cold in some of the scenes even though we had a raging fire going with the heater on. Movie lovers and reviewers especially will enjoy this movie. I foresee Oscar nods. It's one of the best of 2015 for sure. I did find it overly long and belabored at times though and that made it lose a star with me.Gorgeously Shot; DiCaprio Suffers for his Awards but Hardy Steals the Show So Leonardo DiCaprio finally wins an Academy Award for his acting and all he had to do was suffer some of the most extreme filming conditions and choke down some raw meat. I suppose, if nothing else, his dedication to the role is deserving of the praise, even if Tom Hardy completely outshines him in THE REVENANT. The film comes from director Alejandro Iñárritu, who delivered one of my personal favorite films in 2014 with BIRDMAN. It's (very) loosely based on the true tale of fur-trapper Hugh Glass with DiCaprio in the main role. The film is set in the early nineteenth century on the American frontier where Glass and his half-Pawnee son are acting as guides for a team of trappers when they're attacked by a raiding party of Arikara warriors. With many of their men dead and the Arikara on their trail, the men are forced to hike through the wilderness to the closest fort and Glass is the man to get them there. Unfortunately he's attacked by a grizzly bear and left mangled, so the team decides it best to leave a couple of men behind to tend to the fatally injured Glass while they continue on. Once Glass succumbs to his wounds, the men are instructed to give him a proper burial and start for the fort themselves. One of the men (Hardy) who volunteers to remain behind (there was a cash bonus in it for him, you see) gets a little impatient and opts to bury Glass prematurely, killing Glass's son in the process when he interferes. Helplessly witnessing the events, Glass summons his remaining strength to go after the man who murdered his son and sets off on an impossible quest across the freezing wilderness, injured and alone. THE REVENANT is a sort of film experience. The plot is very simple: a quest for revenge. There aren't exactly a lot of twists and turns to the story; it's very straightforward. It's the experience of watching Glass undergo just an insane amount of trials and tribulations to accomplish his goal that I find so mesmerizing. It is two and a half hours of DiCaprio dragging his dying, mutilated Glass through freezing temperatures while scrounging for heat and food with an angry Arikara war party on his tail. I really want to know how much of this movie was done for real because DiCaprio does some pretty gnarly things for this role. I believe I'd read somewhere that he'd really chowed on some raw fish, scales and all, for the scene where he fishes one out of the river and maybe even the hunk o' bison he very visibly gags down later on. Butwhat about that horse scene? I know Iñárritu was dedicated to capturing realism in the struggle, and that horse looked real enough. I don't know. If it was special effects, congratulations to the SFX crew that put that together because, wow, you could've fooled me. Leonardo DiCaprio must've really wanted that Oscar because, regardless of what's real and what's SFX, he went through some rough times filming this movie. Iñárritu is one of the most artistic modern filmmakers I'm aware of and I'm sure the production was rough on all parties involved to get it right. But it all serves a purpose, as THE REVENANT is one of the most beautiful (and grueling) films you'll find from 2015, a year when big budget CG blockbusters dominated the market. Most visually remarkable films nowadays spend countless hours in front of a green screen; meanwhile, Iñárritu is out in the wilderness using natural light to present an amazing tale of survival. Well, survival and revenge. Glass isn't just dragging himself back to civilization because he refuses to die in a half-finished hole in the ground. He's hunting the man who murdered his son, and that man is Tom Hardy. Hardy, who maybe should've won that Oscar himself for best supporting actor here, gets the far more interesting character. His man, John Fitzgerald, is at a bad point in his life. All he's got going for himself is the money he stands to make on this fur-trapping expedition and the Arikara threw a wrench into that plan. All he wants is to get the furs back to the fort and get his paycheck and Glass, unlucky as he may have been with that bear attack, is jeopardizing all of it. His motivations are clear though he's far from sympathetic. He's racist toward the natives (and therefore butts heads with Glass's half-Indian son long before their final confrontation) and only worried about his own needs. Once you become accustomed to his mush-mouthed dialogue delivery Hardy steals the show with his performance and I started finding myself more interested in the movie when it cut away from Glass's struggles to check in on Fitzgerald and his scheme. DiCaprio is great in the movie but, no matter what movie or role, I always look at him and see DiCaprio; Hardy is the total opposite, disappearing into whatever role he's performing. THE REVENANT acts as a solid comparison between the two critically-lauded actors and gives me further appreciation for Hardy and his talent. Between the two of them and Iñárritu's filmmaking prowess, THE REVENANT comes highly recommended from me. It can feel its length at times but even when the pace slows there's always something incredible just around the corner to recapture your interest. Moreover, you get a good sense for the blood, sweat, and tears that went into making the film from the entire cast and crew. Give it a watch.Beautiful, but... "The Revenant" is like necessary evil; it is so easy to admire but very difficult to love. It resides in a mundane world notwithstanding being very beautiful to look at. Perhaps that is the vision of director Alejandro G. Iñárritu – to construct a picture that is formidable in its filmmaking and at the same time paints Hugh Glass's (Leonardo DiCaprio) steadfastness and his legendary journey for survival. Either way, I still regard his previous work which is "Birdman" to be the superior movie overall. It was built on a very simple tale – a son is being killed, and the protagonist goes all-out to hunt down the criminal. Although the movie has 'revenge' elements in it, it is best interpreted as a survival-drama instead of a revenge-drama picture. DiCaprio delivered a performance which led to his first Oscar win while Tom Hardy's act as the movie's villain Fitzgerald was just astonishing. Tom Hardy is no doubt one of the best actors working in Hollywood today where we've seen him in lots of movies and had been in all sorts of characters. Will Poulter was great too, but I can't say the same for Domhall Gleeson's performance. The film's cinematography led by Emmanuel Lubezki is eye-popping, despite being shot on digital instead of film. It is still as solid as it tried to be. Performances are great, cinematography is great, although DiCaprio's historic triumph will overshadow the movie's other achievements. I can understand the film's difficulty in entering the top 5% of critics' choice last year. This ugly-pretty picture adopted a serious tone that seemed to be too joyless. "The Revenant" is clearly not for the masses. The rudiments of its ideas are to sculpt an artistic, expressive art, but primarily not to entertain. The accolades that had gotten the film's great success is surely, I guessed now, is well-deserved. (Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)LOvely An inadequate script is superbly executed in The Revenant, turning half a movie's worth of material into an exhausting, if occasionally transcendent, trek that congratulates the viewer for having survived its icy blasts of testosterone. Based in part on the exploits of Hugh Glass—or at least on several books about him—the two-and-a-half-hour film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Glass, a Scots-American trapper in the early 19th century. (He was called Zach Bass when Richard Harris played the same character in 1971's Man in the Wilderness.) Slogging through the chilly Rockies, our guy is scouting for a fur-swapping outfit loosely held together by a quasi-officer played by Domhnall Gleeson. Glass has an almost-grown son (Forrest Goodluck) by an absent native woman, and something about this, or his basic authority, triggers the bitter resentment of fellow hunting party member John Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy, with an accent so thick-tongued I still have no idea what he said about anything. Far from the main party, Glass is suddenly mauled by a bear in the most stomach-churning scene of the season, and Fitzgerald wants to leave him behind. The much younger Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) is somehow convinced to go along with that, although he later claims not to have understood Fitzgerald, and we believe him. The gravely wounded scout then suffers one depredation after another in his quest to return to civilization, and of course to wreak revenge on the dudes who deserted him. In real life, Glass never saw Fitzgerald again, and Bridger went on to become a famous explorer. But director Alejandro G. Iñárritu, having survived his bout of urban satire with Birdman, isn't content to let nature inflict its wintry drama on our hero's body. Sure, Leonardo's character has to cut open a horse and crawl inside it to survive a snowstorm, but he also needs multiple foes of the human kind. That's a shame, because the real drama here is in the landscapes captured by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki—mostly in Alberta, then Argentina, when they ran out of snow. The movie labours hard to capture the humbling spirituality of The Tree of Life and other Terrence Malick films, but its sometimes astounding beauty remains surprisingly shallow.A beautifully constructed yet slightly imperfect achievement! I find a large amount of awe when it comes to the career of Leonardo DiCaprio. I cannot think of a film hr has been in which could be considered terrible. He has consistently proved that his ability to act is stellar whatever he may be. Whether that be a corrupted stockbroker, a man on the run from the FBI or even an undercover cop, Leo can surely do an unprecedented amount of good! Today, I want to focus on one of his latest works. In which he plays folk legend Hugh Glass; who has a taste for revenge. I'm talking about his Academy Award role in "The Revenant". This masterfully constructed film comes from 3-time Oscar winner Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who most people will know him for his work on Birdman (Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) and Babel. His film the previous year stole 4 of the big awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Writing (all of which I believe should have gone to Grand Budapest Hotel but that is beside the point. I want to start with my dislikes, because it's always best to get the negatives out of the way in order to have the good stuff in the end. OK, even as a casual watcher when I watched it for the 4th time, I began to see some continuity issues, believe me, these are tiny issues but they are things I have picked up on since I have begun studying film. But for a person who only watched to enjoy, then this will go completely unnoticed. I also find some scenes to be completely unnecessary, although I won't go into what those scenes are, if you have watched it or plan to watch it, then you will understand the scenes I'm talking about. Now, let's get into the good stuff, probably the best part about this film is the use of lighting. Every single shot has been created with natural lighting, which gives the film a beautifully striking yet slightly dull colour pallet. Bright whites, dark blues/purples and thick blacks give the film a visually striking and gorgeous look. It also doesn't hurt that the cinematography is stunning as well. Every shot is beautiful and has been thought about in great detail, the open plains, deep forests and soaring mountain ranges of North America truly are a spectacle. And this all comes from Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki, who is also known for his work on both Birdman as well as Children of men. Let's take a look at performances. I cannot start to talk about the performances in The Revenant without mentioning my thoughts on 2015's Best Actor winner. I personally believe that year, Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Dalton Trumbo blew the competition away. Despite my thoughts on who I believe should have won, I still think Leo is spectacular in this film, Leo has most definitely set the bat for acing in this type of film genre. A leading actor cannot be amazing without an excellent supporting actor, and Tom Hardy secures that place masterfully. Once again, I did not agree with Mark Rylance Oscar steal in 2015, despite it not being an awful performance. Mark may have taken the award, but Tom deserved it even more than he did, his character is distasteful and sinister, and Tom captures this essence beautifully; it truly is an unforgettable performance. I would overall give this film a 9/10, it is by no means perfect, but what is here is so interesting and engaging, the flaws die down in the grand scheme of the overall film.Emotional roller-coaster of a movie - full spectrum of humanity explored, from the brutal ruthless streak we have to the mercy and love we can express. I have to say there were more than a few moments that brought a tear to my eye. Glass had tragically lost his Native Indian wife, then was left alone to bring up his mixed-race son in such harsh circumstances. His son (Hawk) was all he had and then he loses his son in such a brutal manner whilst unable to lift a finger, I felt like I was going through the same emotions as Glass. Then comes the determination of humanity. Being left for dead the only thing that drives him on to seek vengeance is the love for his son. Dicaprio delivers an outstanding performance, Hardy nailed it too as the worst that humanity can offer. Cinematography is outstanding but it was the emotional story line that hooked me. It will rip your heart to shreds, more so if you are a single parent. The best movie I've seen.Can you bear it? Puns aside (and I can only guess that you at least heard about the infamous scene I'm referring to), this is a rather gruelling and very violent movie. It really is very visceral and you will see things that are commonly attached to either horror movies or violent action movies. But it is necessary to go all the way to show what characters have to endure and go through at certain points. So the viewer can really feel what is going on. No matter how hard it is to watch that is. And Leonardo Di Caprio did win an Oscar. Finally his fans will say. Though even they admit, it might not be his best movie or rather best performance in a movie. But that's not what counts. What counts is the journey and the fact he did deserve one overall speaking. It's a bleak movie and it won't be everyone's taste, but once you cope with what's happening you will have enough tension to hold you until the end of the movieI walked out of this after 30 minutes Just so stupid and obvious, full clichés.  I walked out after the bear attack and they asked if someone will stay behind to take care of him, and inevitably its the guy who been trying to kill him who decides to stay behind. Really, really!  Hey Hitler, do you mind taking in some Jewish refugees? sure, bring them in, all of them. And what happens? he takes a pot at killing him, but lo and behold, he survives somehow. Guy has a knife, a gun, killed 2 other perfectly healthy adults but can't kill a guy in a stretcher that can't move. How did this thing win any award is beyond me, a movie is about telling a good story, and this story this terrible, oh the acting is great, look at the camera work, who cares if you can't stomach the story!There's a Billion Revenge Films, and This is The Best One. The Revenant is one of my favorite movies of all time. It follows the story of Hugh Glass, a man who was betrayed by a man he trusted, and will stop at nothing to track him down. The plot is pretty simple, yes. But that doesn't mean the movie is bad. DiCaprio put his heart and soul into this movie. Despite saying almost nothing throughout the movie, you always know how he's feeling. His face always tells you everything you need to know. Not just any actor can do that. Tom Hardy also does a great job with his character. The movie is beautiful. It was filmed pretty much all on location, with only natural lighting. People complain about the amount of still shots and shots of nature, but I though it did a nice job of slowing the pace, showing where the character was, and showing you just how beautiful nature is. The whole movie builds up to the ending, and you will not be let down. When the movie ended, no one left the theater until the credits were over. My friend and I didn't even speak until we after the 45 minute ride home. We were too amazed with what we had just seen. Please, please, PLEASE go see this film. Get yourself a Blu Ray player and a nice big HD flat screen. What you see, is something you won't forget for a lifetime.The wool is over everyone's eyes There is a thing that happens every year when DiCaprio's movie that is good enough to get into Oscar contention releases. His fans are eagerly anticipating it to be more in the line of the departed(aka macho movie which celebrates masculinity) and not a j.edgar. Then the movie comes out which more or less gives them what they expect. Which is a well made movie that doesnt challenge the audience nor does it People often forget how accurate studios are with the release date they give a movie. They dont waste prime oscar release slots for oscar misfires..they allocate those slots for movies they think they can get behind and market/campaign to successful results atleast getting nominations. So you know if a studio like fox or paramount is heavily marketing a movie then at the very least it will get bunch of oscar nominations aka the movie is worthy enough for bunch of nominations. Then all the people inside hollywood or on the peripherals of hollywood who ever benefited from Dicaprio will root for him. In entertainment industry people are loyal to favors and not to actual talent. Its like living on a ship. You are loyal to whomever helps your stay on the ship and not the best person on the ship.Biggest currency in hollywood is doing favors. What I often thought that proved to be wrong this year is the size of the people that owe him favor is much larger than imagined. They are in every walk of showbiz campaigners,studio exes,producers,actresses,actors,directors,anchors,music artists who are his buddies at parties etc. Who do you think margot robbie will vote for when dicaprio is one of the nominees ? he practically launched her career ..all these mask what the movie really is. Which is , its a movie competently made by a director who wanted to take on a challenging subject and then an actor who helped get the checks to make the movie and everything about this movie is honest except the lead actor. Lead actor covers up his incompetence perfectly by trying so hard with over acting, by spending so much money to make the movie as authentically as possible and alas at then end a significant portion of audience who dont know anything about acting think of him as the greatest actor ever.Original and Magnificent Hands down this movie was done so well. From the acting to the picture, everything fit so well. I can't describe to you the appreciation I have towards the cinematography in this film and the effort it took to make the natural light fit. Alejandro did such an amazing job on the shots and the story was just so original. The life of these men was difficult and Alejandro portrays it so well. Definitely go see this movie and look above the entertainment aspect and appreciate it for everything. The CGI in this film was great as well but what really made me admire this film a lot was the lack of using CGI. The landscapes were all real from the mountains to the forest. You do not see that a lot in movies these days so it was amazing to see this was REAL life shooting. Just thinking how they filmed in parts of Canada and Argentina with a crew of 100+ is amazing. Great film, I hope to see Alejandro continue with this sort of taste to cinema.Wonderful pictures from the wild landscapes I heard from friends that this film would contain some brutal scenes. Then I thought I will be bored cause of the long running time. Well, there were so many adventure and wonderful pictures that kept all the time my attention. The best was the bear attack I have never seen before. Leonardo Di Caprio delivered again an outstanding performance for which finally he won the Oscar. Congratulations and thank you to all the staff for this masterpiece. 7/10.Brutal but great survival story Leo dicaprio certainly deserved the Oscar for best actor. The pain and desire feels increasingly real as the picture goes on, making it harder and harder to stop yourself cringing at some of the things Hugh glass does to stay alive. No one in today's industry could bring the raw emotion and determination to the role as dicaprio did. One shot toward the end of the film just has him staring into the camera, the pain and desire for survival dances in his eyes almost as if he had actually suffered from the events in the film. It is a knock out performance from Leo that makes the audience feel everything he feels. The number of one-shot sequences just blew me away, the cinematography of the famous bear mauling scene is just mesmerising despite it making you wince frequently. I didn't think Alejandro inaritu could top last years spellbinding movie "birdman", that also had some of the best cinematography I've ever seen, but here is a brutal, flawless, gripping western survival flick that ceases you by the balls from the first scene till the last.Downhill after the first twenty minutes This movie fails a basic test for me: is the ending better, or at least as good, as the beginning. The answer is a firm no. The first twenty minutes are really good, and the bear scene is painstaking and amazing. But after that it all muddles through. It's beautiful, yes, and I can see the filmmaker and scriptwriter trying to bring in action when it lulls. But the side plots (an abducted indigenous woman, the moral questions of side characters) are beside the point and never go anywhere. And like many films, the middle is about 45 minutes too long. When filmmakers and stars get enough power, they seem to reach a point where few people are willing to tell them to trim. The Revenant is case in point.A brutal and painful thrill ride from beginning to end The Revenant is a film based on true events. It tells the story about a fur trapper named Hugh Glass who is brutally mauled after a grizzly bear attack ,while he is on a journey with his team of fur trappers in America in the year 1823. After he is left for dead in the wilderness by his own crew, he is forced to survive and find his way back to Fort Kiowa alive, as well as seeking revenge on the man that left him in this situation.  First of all I have to say that this movie blew my mind the first time I watched it. This isn´t just because of all the pain and suffering that Hugh Glass went through, but also because of the way the filmmakers handled the cinematography and use of camera in the wilderness. It made me actually feel like I was in those environments with the characters, because of how realistic it looks. Whenever someone are killed or die during this movie, it honestly looks like the actual actors are killed of for real. That's what I am talking about when I mean "realistic". This is all due to the use of natural light and real locations, and the fact that they never used any kind of studio light. Every single scene is filmed on a real location, and with only the natural lighting to help them shoot the sequences. There are a few special effects and some CGI in this film, but these aspects are only used when they really had to, like the bear for instance. Overall I can say that this is a really impressive made movie when talking about the visual imagery, and how the director Alejandro Gonzalez successfully managed to bring a true story into a long runtime film in such a realistic and intense way. The actors in this film deliver a fantastic performance on the screen in each of their roles, especially Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy that I think is absolutely Oscar worthy in this movie. The production design and use of costumes and practical effects, also helped this movie look pretty awesome, and this made me truly believe that these events were taking place in the wilderness in the 1800's. The movie is not perfect of course, because it got a few issues within the story and plot, and the way it is told to the audience can feel a little abrupt at times, because there are a couple of exposition scenes within the film that kind of slows down the pacing and the momentum that we got in the first act, and does not really add much weight to the plot at all. These sequences are beautifully shot and the actors does all a great job, but it is just that the scenes was not that kind of interesting and felt a little unnecessary for the rest of the movie in my opinion. This is absolutely a movie I would recommend you watching, no matter what kind of genres you are into. It couldn´t have been more excruciating and brutal than this. This is filmmaking at it's best.Amazing movie This is not the first time that we saw Leo doing mind boggling stuff, he is a great actor, by far the greatest actor working currently I suppose, but this time he really took the things to the limits and a act for which he really deserve an Oscar. Love you LeoEmperor's new clothes time... Well, I have to say I don't really understand what all of the excitement was about for this very long movie that literally has about 5 minutes of a story line and ten to fifteen minutes of worthwhile scene watching. If anyone here says it would take longer than 5 minutes to give an incredibly in depth review of the story they are blessed with the gift of gab and exaggeration.  DiCaprio and The Bear are the only two good things about the movie. If they didn't get Leonardo to act this part I doubt that anyone would have rated the movie more than a 2 out of 10. The two points would have come from 1) The opening scene of a few minutes and 2) the bear scene. His great job make it a three... Save yourself over two hours of relatively useless movie, watch these two scenes and be impressed and happy. Otherwise it's on you to figure out why you gave up over two hours of your life that you will never get back.As long as you breathe, you fight. A group of American fur hunters who use Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) as their guide are attacked by Native Americans. A small group escape by boat, but they know they are being tracked. Unknown to the fur hunters the Native Americans are looking for the chief's daughter who was abducted. Glass devises a plan to throw off the trackers. Unfortunately he gets mauled by a grizzly in a very realistic scene of which the trailer only gives you a glimpse. Near death, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) a crusty untrustworthy man, is left behind to tend to Glass and give him a proper burial when he dies. Events happen that turns Fitzgerald into the film's antagonist as Glass pulls out all the stops to survive in the dead of winter and seek justice. This is not a lone man survivalist film as Glass meets people along the way. There is also a subplot involving Fitzgerald and his group that make it back to the fort. Very gritty film. Guide: F-bomb, brief rape, brief Leonardo DiCaprio butt nudity.Brilliant first 30 minutes, then go and grab a pizza somewhere... Spoilers! Lots of them! The first half hour or so of this is totally rivetting, especially on the big screen. The skirmish/battle scene is one of the best I've ever seen, genuinely terrifying, with the confusion and terror being perfectly rendered on the screen. And of course the bear attack, real edge of the seat stuff. The do yourself a favour and go home - you've had good value for you money, and if you stay you're about to waste two hours of your life. What's wrong? It's just silly basically. The ironically-named Mr Glass (he's indestructable, hence the irony) is so badly injured by the bear he can only move his eyes. Then he can just barely crawl through the woods. Then suddenly he's walking with the aid of a branch. Then he survives a near-freezing river experience without a sign of hypothermia. Then he's jumping on a horse's back. I can't do that and I'm really fit, no bear-mauling damage at all! Next he has a magic musket. Muskets fire one shot. Then they have to be reloaded. But Mr Glass has acquired the world's first self-loading musket, because it seems able to fire at will, without requiring powder, shot, etc. He rides of a cliff into the top of a tree then subsequently falls to the ground. No damage, obviously. Mr Indestructable! Then he climbs into the stomach of his dead horse to keep warm, the stomach I presume being around 6 feet or so in length. Gee that was a big horse! Finally arrives at the fort, almost immediately goes back out to find his arch enemy Tom Grumpy Hardy. With one person accompanying him. Why? Why not 20 men? Next he props his shot dead pal on a horse (as a decoy) by putting a branch down the chap's jacket. Why doesn't the dead man simply fall of sideways, or slump off forwards or backwards? No idea. It's magic! I really wanted to like this movie, I like Leonardo di Caprio and also Tom Hardy, and the cinematography is good. But this is just daft, silly, an insult to one's intelligence. It's not a fantasy film after all.Great direction and effects but nothing original here ... The original story about Glass as published in The Missouri Trapper ( http://hughglass.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1825-Hugh-Glass-article.pdf ) was far more interesting due to the bleakness of the real events. This movie would have been richer and more focused if it had dispensed with unnecessary embellishments and stayed closer to the true story. Instead we get a standard serving of tropes on a very pretty plate: Bad thing happens, abandoned person survives against odds to exact his revenge. The end. Oh, and the scenery is beautiful. Tom Hardy's bad guy character, Fitzgerald, never had the chance to be raised from a fairly 2-dimensional mumbling racist. The motivations of the Indian chief looking for his daughter was filler and you could cut out all scenes involving this group and the French trappers, and end up with a tighter film. There were some impressive effects used to create some very long takes - nice sophistication but if you are adding icing to the cake, at least make a nice cake. Almost every other DiCaprio film is better than this one. Watch this if you really don't have anything else to do for 2.5 hours.Worth ALL The Hype! A note to light-hearted movie goers: The Revenant is not for you. Life pits it's will on Hugh Glass, the real-life tracker &amp; fur trapper played excellently by Leonardo DiCaprio. And director Alejandro G. Iñárritu damn near tortures his cast &amp; audience in telling the story of Glass' revenge against the people, headed by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who done him wrong. Set in the untamed West of 1823, this is one brutal epic piece of film making. The visionary result is so relentlessly raw some of the actors referred to the filming as a living hell and watching the movie, you can feel their pain. The movie doesn't take long to get started and you can barely even get your bearings of what's going on before Glass and his expedition are attacked by Arikara Indians and as mayhem ensues, Glass strives to protect his half-Pawnee son, Hawk. But that is all tame in comparison for what is about to come. I am, of course, talking about the infamous fight scene where a mother grizzly (protecting her cubs) lays into Glass like a demon possessed. Make no mistake - this scene is as brutal as it comes and while you know that it's all "film trickery", it still doesn't stop you from believing it's real when you're actually watching it unfold. The whole movie, though, and not just that scene, is a visceral punch in the gut. You could gripe about the excess carnage and lack of philosophical substance, but surviving nature is Iñárritu's subject here, and he delivers with brilliance. And then there's DiCaprio. Hidden behind a grotty beard, his words are mostly reduced to grunts, but he nonetheless provides a portrait of a man in full. It's a virtuoso performance, thrilling in its brute force and is well deserving of his Oscar nomination &amp; win The Revenant is one of those movies that justifies it's hype, award nominations and wins. Definitely a must see film.Absolute trash People do not like this movie because it is good- they like it because other people tell them to like it. It is not a good film. It is one of the worst films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I spent two hours on a pile of trash- I was forced to watch it, really, I never wanted to- but I went ahead anyway, and I'm glad I watched it, because now I can warn you about it. Do not watch this movie. First of all, the movie is boring. But it's also too exciting at the same time. When I saw this film, I thought it had been made by a crazy person, because there was no plot as far as I could tell. All I saw was a neverending cavalcade of images- men running through the snow, getting bloodied up- shadows and lines and whispering, and big burly bearded pioneers. It was like the anti-violence therapy that Alex gets in A Clockwork Orange. I realized that this was a film that cared more about its visuals than its core message- it spent billions on renting and props and setting and cameras- but spent almost nothing on making the characters likable or having any lines. They could have made it a silent movie- nobody ever talks, except for a few seldom occasions. Some screaming, and a grizzled old pioneer tells a crazy story about a dead chipmunk or something- but that's it. The script mast have been three pages long.  I don't like Leonardo DiCaprio- I had never seen a film with him in it before this one- so I didn't need to be confused about which grizzled old pioneer he was. But I was so confused. All the bearded mountain men looked identical- I couldn't even tell the protagonist from the villain. I didn't even know there was a villain until the very end, when they meet up with each other. I did not know what was going on. All I saw was snow and men and blood. Everything about it was unclear.  It was disgusting- he falls off cliffs, gets eaten by a bear, swims in sub zero water, eats a stomach or something- this is a snuff film, not a historical drama. I do not want to watch a man come near death for two long hours. But even the most action packed scenes did not excite me- strangely, they bored me. I was bored by this movie. It's not a good movie. It was made by the same stupid idiot as Birdman- I should have guessed- and we can see, in the first scene, that it is made by the same idiot as Birdman. The first scene has a bunch of pioneers stumbling around, setting up camp- and it's all taken in ONE SHOT, and the perspective of the camera sways around the actors, zigzagging- and then they get attacked by some indians, and they run around, and the camera follows them, instead of just staying still- all just in ONE SHOT- and then we get some cuts, which are nice, because I hate that "one shot" business that the guy always gives us. He did it enough in Birdman- he didn't need to do it here. Also, they added Native Americans in- even though the guy in real life DIDN'T HAVE ANY INDIAN RELATIVES- in fact, the guy who made this movie was criticized for how historically inaccurate it was- how dramatized it was, all in the hopes of getting some more cash from gullible suckers- how much unnecessary violence there was in it- and how he just added some Indians in there to be politically correct. How sad. How sad. There do not need to be any Indians. Not racist, it's just that there shouldn't be any Indians if there WEREN'T any Indians. This film is absolute trash from the gutter. Do not watch it. It is a waste of money.A Visual Wonder This was a review I wrote back in early 2016 for a class project, so this was before Leo won his Oscar. The Revenant is the movie many say is finally going to get Leonardo DiCaprio his long deserved Best Actor Oscar. Inspired by true events and directed by Academy Award winner Alejandro González Iñárritu (Birdman), this Action/Drama film has received Oscar nominations for acting, cinematography, editing and many more categories. But does it live up to all of the critical attention it's getting? The movie starts out with a panning shot of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) and his son Hawk (Forest Goodluck) in a flashback in which his deceased Indian wife is encouraging him to keep fighting onward. The film then cuts to a continuous shot of Glass and some of his regiment hunting for food for their camp in unsettled territory. While they are gone, a hostile clan of Indians attacks their camp, killing around 30 of Glass's men. The survivors retreat to the river and escape on their boat, only to abandon it in an attempt to mislead the pursuing warriors. Things take a turn for the worse when Glass gets mauled by a bear and is near death. John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) echoes the sentiments of many who believe they should leave Glass behind to increase their odds of survival. But when money is offered by one of the regiment commanders to stay with Glass until he is able to move, Fitzgerald volunteers along with Bridges (Will Poulter) and Hawk. Eventually Fitzgerald gets tired of baby sitting and tries to kill Glass, but ends up killing Hawk instead. He lies to Bridges about Indians approaching and they both leave Glass for dead. Abandoned, Glass (with the help of the voice of his dead wife) picks himself up, conquers the elements and gets back to his camp. The remainder of this epic film recounts his perilous tale of survival.  Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic, Inception) delivers one of the best performances of his career, playing Hugh Glass, a man whose wife was killed by soldiers during a raid. In a good eighty percent of the film Glass is mute due to a bear attack in which his vocal cords were damaged. Unable to speak, he communicates an incredible array of emotion through his facial expressions and actions. There's one scene when he is strapped to a plank of wood, still recovering from his wounds and Fitzgerald wants to kill him, but Hawk saves him. Fitzgerald then stabs Hawk and Glass is upset to the point of foaming at the mouth out of anger at Fitzgerald for killing his only son. In another scene Glass is cautiously approaching an Indian from his wife's tribe. When the Indian points his weapon at him, he immediately falls and successfully explains that he is injured and needs help using body language. DiCaprio has come a long way from the pretty boy he played in Titanic, and while this isn't my personal favorite Leonardo DiCaprio movie, his ability to convey complex emotions and communicate without dialogue definitely makes this performance Oscar worthy. I hope he finally gets it.  Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises, Mad Max: Fury Road) plays the antagonist in this movie, and is an extremely unlikable, selfish jerk throughout the film. He is constantly finding ways to take advantage of others for personal gain. He shows this best in one scene where he and Bridges are traveling back to the camp to get their reward for staying behind. Bridges asks Fitzgerald, at gunpoint, if he lied to him about leaving Glass because of incoming Indians and Fitzgerald says yes. Bridges isn't the bravest or the smartest of men, and is unaware that his gun isn't loaded. Fitzgerald, however, knows the gun is not loaded and wrestles it from Bridges. He points it at Bridges, telling him to stay quiet about the lie. In classic villain fashion, he says "the Lord giveth and taketh" and pulls the trigger. Bridges of course is OK, but has received the message loud and clear. At the end of the film Fitzgerald in his final act of cowardliness, tries to kill Glass to cover up his lies and treasonous acts. It was a hard fought battle but in the end, Fitzgerald bites the bullet, or in this case, the arrow. An excellent performance overall by this multi-talented actor who should be a contender for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Alejandro González Iñárritu hired Emmanuel Lubeski for the cinematography, and it is some of the best I've ever seen. He makes some interesting choices like multiple continuous, one take shots. The best example is when DiCaprio gets attacked by the bear. The way they shot it in one take is absolutely outstanding. Just when you think they are going to cut away to another angle, they stay with the same shot throughout the entire scene, which makes it even more tense than it already is. Another technique Lubeski used a lot was close ups on the characters' faces. Probably the most intense part of the film, aside from the bear attack, is the final fight between Glass and Fitzgerald, which is mostly done in one take. The way they zoom in on the battle made me super tense from the expressions on their faces as they were dueling to the death. He also shows incredible scenery in many shots. We soak up mountains, sky, horizon, and forests thanks to Lubeski's glorious camera work. I would not be surprised if he won the Oscar for Best Cinematography; this guy know how to make scenes visually memorable.  The soundtrack was created by Alva Noto and Ryûichi Sakamoto, two names I have not seen before. They do a good job setting the scene by the use and lack of use of background music. In the beginning of the film when the Indians are invading Glass's camp, the music drowns out the battle sounds, setting up the somber mood of the lives being lost as Glass and his men retreat to their boat on the shore. Probably my favorite instance of where they don't have any music is the scene where the bear mauls Glass. The absence of the music make the scene extremely tense since were are forced to listen to the agonizing screams of Glass and the grunts of the bear without anything to soften or detract from those sounds. The music finally comes back in at the very end of the scene when Glass and the bear fall down the hill and the bear lands on him and both lay motionless. I will definitely keep my ears open next time I go see a film with these two as the film composers. Of course, movies are not perfect, and there are a few nitpicks that I have with the film. The first one is in the scene where Glass is still recovering from his bear attack and some hostile Indians find him near a stream. He gets away by swimming. He can hardly walk without collapsing, so how can he swim as fast as he did away from the Indians? The current helped a bit but there were sections of the river that were calm and the Indians were shooting him with arrows. One or two should of hit him. Another issue comes up after Glass rescues an Indian girl from a rapist and flees from the group the rapist is from. He then falls off a cliff into a tall tree while his horse falls all the way down and dies on impact. In the next shot Glass looks fine except for having a bit of difficulty walking. This makes little sense since he was critically injured earlier in the film and is still not one hundred percent back to full health. And finally, immediately after the fall, a snowstorm hits, and Glass cuts out the organs of his dead horse, goes inside for warmth (much like Luke in Star Wars Episode V) and survives the night inside the horse buck naked. I would think that would lead to a faster death by frostbite, but I'm no expert. It just left me confused and a little skeptical. These must have been the embellishments to the "inspired by actual events". There were some instances where an off-camera character's voice sounded a bit odd, like 2 of the same person was speaking at the same time, but that only happened a few times. Even the best of films can have a few small flaws.  Overall, The Revenant is one of the best movies of 2015, which says a lot coming from a year that produced films like Star Wars, Mad Max and Inside Out. The acting is great, the chemistry between the actors is believable, the cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen, and the music makes the scenes memorable. It definitely deserves a least a few awards, one for the cinematography and one for Leonardo DiCaprio for pulling off an excellent performance of a character that had to be very difficult to portray. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of DiCaprio, great camera work and intense survival films.A ghost film about a revenant, a double miss Let's say it, this film is one of the Oscar-flop of 2016. Beautiful object, by an excellent filmmaker, but for once has planted. The Academy (and others) did not see anything. The immediate impression is very positive. The photography is spectacular, costumes, makeup perfect (it's like) and the physical commitment of all the actors is impressive. The rhythm is slow, the plans are long and fluid. The story ... that's where it gets stuck. This film is gold wrapping that wraps a bronze medal (it could have been chocolate) I think Father Iñárritu got lost in his technical performance and the intensity of the context of his shooting. After the very successful Birdman, who already put in play a technical challenge (very long shots) but was touching and fascinating by his scenario, his characters and this subtle game between the theatrical form and cinematograph, here he adds a technical layer but forget about everything else. Because for the form, it is difficult to do better. Mainly thanks to the shooting locations and the magic of the weather phenomena. Magic that made several team members left the shoot because of the difficult conditions. Here too we are dealing with long, very smooth shots, but because there is a but, this process is not ideal in all situations. And not all the time. The specificity of cinema is the succession of different points of view. The transition from one plane to another is an alchemy that creates our emotional involvement. A little like the chemistry that makes it possible to obtain a 3rd ingredient from the two completely different 1sts, the assembly makes it possible to create a sensation which is born from this succession of different images. Here this process involves us in what is happening on the screen (being a witness continuously of everything that happens) but curiously I found that it prevented me at the same time from entering the heart Of the history. I floated around the characters and in these snow-covered forests but I was not there. I think that's where the technical process became its own justification and no longer a way of telling the story. Each day of shooting, the whole team repeated (blocking) these very complicated plans and at the end of the day, they had about 1 h 30 to turn the shots or plans. That's probably what made the filming so hard and long. A system to be able to say that one kept his line, that one preserved an artistic integrity. Unfortunately, when a method becomes its own raison d'être, it condemns the purpose of the company: tell a story, make us live emotions. There are several moments when wow have it in his head, but the heart is not there. Because the story is very linear and does not carry major issues. For short, it comes down to: argument, left for dead, survival, revenge, end. During each of these stages, few moral questions are raised. There are some, but they remain confined to the facts presented. We leave the wounded man to his fate: but he is still alive, yes, but the Indians are coming. That kind. For a good part of the movie, DiCaprio struggles like hell. This kind of experience forces the one who lives it to make profound changes, such as during a pilgrimage. Here (almost) nothing. The character advances, survives, fights but nothing lets feel that he really lives the situation. Probably because the process (yet): paste a wide-angle lens on the nose of the actors imposes a way of seeing things that does not necessarily stick with what we tell. The system becomes its own disadvantage and kills what has spawned it. We are very far from Seul au Monde, with Tom Hanks, where we feel transformed over the course of his adventure. I was infinitely more excited when I saw The Gray with Liam Neeson. Same context, the Indians in less, the soul and more, The physical commitment of the actor is admirable but that's not what makes you vibrate. There are indeed some effects of style (appearances of his wife and son - adoptive) but which are only dreams, visions. They show us what he lost. Painful detail that must be taken into account before seeing this film: its masochism. The number of sufferings through which the protagonist goes is such that it made me think of Mel Gibson's Passion. 2 hours of whipping. Here it is a little that, more varied. Such a martyr is almost survivalist pornography. All this for what? A story of revenge. History of fat and cruel colonists. Iñárritu has offered us some sumptuous films like 21 Grams or Babel. But here, the shell is empty, because I do not see what can be removed. Even the best filmmakers can crash. Iñárritu often talks about the ego in his interviews. And in general, it is people who have trouble getting rid of it who talk about it the most. I think he got himself here. This film has the form of a work of art but does not have the substance. Its shape is reminiscent of Terrence Malick's films except that it is sorely lacking in sensitivity. Malick (in The Tree of Life for example) shows a succession of moments of life, without necessarily linking them by a dramatic plot, but everything digs in us and throughout the film, we are brought into this state that makes the films so wonderful sometimes. Here we live viscerally events (which is already not bad) but nothing "hollow". We could make a musical analogy: this film is a bit like the last albums of the Dream Theater group. Formerly the spearhead of progressive hard-rock inventive, sensitive and technically very high level. Today they play their own farce, flowing in an infinite complexity but without soul. In view of the beauty of the film's photography, the intensity of the actors' play (should they overplay for that to be seen behind their hair and their disheveled beard? Or is it to compensate for the emptiness of the characters?) and its slow form, it is easy to believe in a great movie. Iñárritu probably believes it. To believe is not to be. In any case, I did not find what makes me go sit in a dark room. I bet in a little while, nobody will talk about this movie anymore. Only time reveals what's true and what's not.Amazing in every regard except for story. Its a shame that in a movie with such exceptional directing, acting, cinematography, music, and production design that the story couldn't have been amazing as well. That's not to say that the story here is necessarily bad it just feels a little thin especially for a 2 1/2 hour film.  There are definitely elements of a compelling story here, especially when it comes to the internal and external conflicts of the two main characters, Hugh Glass and John Fitzgerald (played marvelously by Leonardo DiCaprio in a career best performance and Tom Hardy) Hardy in particular is the most fleshed out and interesting character and has several monologues that let you get to know him as a person and its pretty riveting. The movie clearly is not trying to be story driven, instead its more focused on imagery and themes and does both very well. In fact basically everything about this movie is spectacular hence the high rating, but if it had a better story this could easily be a 10/10 and one of the greatest films ever made. Still worth a watch at least once, especially if your interested in making films yourself someday because their is plenty of mastery here both behind and in front of the camera.  To talk a little more in detail about the acting its superb all around. I'm not always the biggest fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, in fact I think he has given many overrated/underwhelming performances, but he knocks it out of the park here with a subtle and nuanced performance. DiCaprio shows a ton of emotion here despite not having very many lines which is not something I would have thought was in his ability's but I was proven wrong here.  Tom Hardy is exceptional as the main antagonist of the film. He does a good job making his character not feel evil necessarily, but like an ordinary man who's trying to survive and painfully unfeeling towards his fellow man due to his past. Its Hardy's best work since Bronson.  Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson are also both totally believable in supporting roles as well.allot of reapect for the actors working in such weather conditions I really loved the movie! very real especial effects. Leonardo dicaprio gives his all in this movie. Only there is a cliff he falls off at one point with horse was to much! But with my experiences in life everything can happenin life also falling extra of a cliff with horse you know and i am not being sarcastic in any way! Rest of movie great acting great performance also great acting from Tom hardy and the capiten.Very good film, but not quite great 'The Revenant' (noun: "a person who has returned, supposedly from the dead") is a film about a man left for dead, Glass (DiCaprio), and his lust for revenge keeping him alive in the wilderness. Set in the 1820s, in what was then the Wild West of Montana (but filmed mostly in Alberta, Canada), Captain Henry (Gleeson) and his men, including Glass, his son Hawk (Goodluck), Fitzgerald (Hardy) and Bridger (Poulter) are collecting pelts (I assume deer?) when attacked by Native Americans, setting them on a desperate journey back to 'civilisation'. Obviously, plenty goes wrong, including Glass being attacked by a Grizzly Bear, which even though it's CGI, is an amazing/horrifying thing to watch! He survives, but is left for dead and thus begins his improbable survival tale for vengeance. There was a few things I didn't like that much, including the score (too piercing at times), the length (over two &amp; a half hours, and it meanders for about 40min in the middle) and some of the repetitiveness (always seem to be sitting around a fire!) and unnecessary flash-backs/visions. However, the cinematography is absolutely superb - hopefully more films are made in Canada after this! - and Leo is solid, with his shaggy hair and crazed stare on display. Hardy is great and completely unrecognisable as Mad Max, while Poulter provides the film's conscience. For mine, it's a better film than 'Birdman', but although it strives for it, it's still not an exceptional film. The ending leaves you, like Glass, exhausted and questioning everything.Movie theaters were built for experiences like this Some people will complain about the visual extravagance or the simple emotional notes here...but you gotta be dead not to enjoy this film. Inarritu just followed Birdman (all the words) with The Revenant (no words needed). Enough said. And as if the directing effort was not sufficient/staggering enough, he got two true stars at their absolute pinnacles. This could have been a simple survival and revenge tale, but the visual flair and acting take it to another level. This is what movie theaters are for.Great fim, poor script A great example of how fantastic performances, scenery, cinematography, and possibly direction can be ruined by a script that ends up formulaic, unbelievable, and reliant only on the most base of human emotions. I suspect heavy interference from above on this one.worth watching I originally thought a role such of this was out of DiCaprio's range. I was quite mistaken. He played the part very well, and to my uninformed eye, quite realistically. I felt quite involved with his struggle and liked the insight into the Indians interaction with the various invaders. The movie was interesting, and involving. It definitely deserves the M15+ rating but the violence didn't detract from the story line. It's worth watching, you truly feel involved with this interesting story.This is must watch movie. From the first frame, you know you're here for something special and that's pretty clear. Leonardo has given his everything to this film. Exceptionally beautiful direction and screenplay. Superb cinematography. Poignant soundtrack. specially soundtrack is best of the best. Must watch movie.Don't even bother watching this! When the film initially launched I was stoked, I couldn't wait to see it, however, I was terribly disappointed. If you are into films with the lead character only having a handful of lines, whereas the rest is one big grunt. This might be the perfect film for you. My advice is if you have plenty of time and wants to waste more than 2 hours of your life, feel free to. The only reason Leo received an Oscar for this performance must be, because the committee felt terrible for not awarding him one earlier.Machismo in the mountains We watched this film on the basis of several rave reviews when it first came out. I fail to see why it rated so well. There is spectacular scenery and dramatic camera work. (Although splatters of artificial blood on the camera lens during one of the many violent scenes seem surprisingly sloppy. Nor did the frequent appearance of lens flair serve any artistic purpose as it sometimes can. This was simply careless cinematography.) The whole movie is relentless machismo, one disturbingly violent scene after another and frequent, gratuitous use of the "F word" which was not even in the thesaurus of early nineteenth century profanity. If you're intent on watching this appallingly violent, lengthy, sexist and pointless film, turn the sound down and enjoy the scenery. It is the only positive aspect of a very disappointing movie.The Revenant There is no denying that Alejandro Inarritu is a brilliant director. The single-shot opening to "The Revenant" displayed what made "Birdman" so brilliant. The scenery, cinematography and acting are a triumph in "The Revenant," but what degrades this film is its unnecessarily extended length and relatively weak story (especially considering how little it appears to match the novel). I hope Leo is finally recognized for another consistently strong performance, but even its stellar cinematography cannot match "Mad Max: Fury Road," which is weird to write.Always Too Many Leo Pin Worms Leo is a decent actor and has hardly ever been great. The cinematography and/or wilderness was a huge bonus as it adds a vast mystery to this story. He did alright in this one. The movies he's been in may have been Good, but his acting no so much. Although, he was pretty good in...that wallstreet movie and D'Jango Unchained but that's it. I think (I can't at the moment think of others). As to detail to Revenant, it is boring and tedious, never really developing anything but Leos character' retribution or revenge. The bear scene was good but not movie-making magic, as another review says. While I appreciate the ordeal the real man had to endure, the movie simply lacked character.A Rare Experience It is one of the most beaten clichés of movie-marketing to call in the viewer to experience something unusual. When in truth there are very few filmmakers who are able to pull off something like a sensory cinematic experience.  Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu is one of those rare directors. His movies defy narrative conventions ("21 Grams", "Babel") and also visual templates ("Birdman"). Now he has achieved his next big step. A big budget adventure story that is reduced to its most minimal plot-elements while being a truly immersive experience that manages to give a tangible sense of a long-gone era. Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a tracker who assists a band of fur-trappers in the early nineteenth century. He is attacked by a bear along the frontier of Montana. And after being left for dead finds himself amidst an unforgivable wilderness.  The screenplay written by Mark L. Smith and Iñárritu is a starting point for a film that relies first and foremost on the image and is therefore reconnecting with the era of silent film and the most fundamental roots of the medium. Iñárritu who tried to avoid as much as possible the trappings of computer effects has production designer Jack Fisk, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, costume designer Jacqueline West and his actors pull out all the stops. You are left with images, sounds, faces and languages that force you to reflect on your life two hundred years after the events shown here. Leonardo DiCaprio manages, not unlike Tom Hanks in "Cast Away", to hold the screen with his presence in a performance that is mostly wordless. From teen-heartthrob to superstar to character actor; DiCaprio's trajectory seems to be about choosing his projects according to the challenges they face. And it must be said that his devotion to the portrayal of an archaic character whose prime motivation is survival is as simple and riveting as can be. Before he began shooting "Birdman" Iñárritu sent his cast an image of Philipp Petit, the high-wire artist who walked between the towers of the World Trade Center. It was a symbolic gesture of what he and his collaborators were trying to attempt with their movie. "The Revenant" represents another high-wire act by this Mexican iconoclast. It is a successful attempt to resurrect not only a forgotten time, but also some often neglected qualities of cinema. May it jolt all those timid formula-makers out of their slumber.Dicaprio is back from the dead! There's been a long dry spell since Dicaprio starred in a decent thriller, this film has ended that dry spell. If you can enjoy a movie without IMAX, giant screens &amp; surround sound- then you have found a quality film. I didn't even need to step foot in a theatre, I've enjoyed this movie with about 480p- and still stunning imagery.  I'm amazed by the views and scenery. It gives you a sense of what Dicaprio's character is going through. I won't go into any plot... This movie brought back memories from Christopher Noland's films applaud Alejandro González Iñárritu and Emmanuel Lubezki for their work in this movie, I look forward to more like this.A harsh, brutal and engaging depiction of one man's willpower The trailer for Revenant is very misleading. It would have you believe this film is full of fighting scenes, battles and generally action. It's not. It's mostly about one man's struggle against nature. Overcoming his weakness and injuries in his drive for revenge and survival. The majority of the film is slow-paced and focused on the incredible willpower of the protagonist.  Seeing this film on the big screen can be overwhelming. The brutal, realistic scenes, close-up shots of actors' faces, perfectly showing the struggle and pain they experience, and the incredibly harsh environment, make for one of the most memorable cinematic experiences this year. As can be expected from DiCaprio and Hardy, the acting is phenomenal. One can almost feel the pain, the cold, the hunger and the fear they experience. The camera captures all this perfectly, as well as showing beautiful scenery and biting winter weather, all filmed using only natural light.  The plot, despite being quite simple, keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats, rooting for the hero's survival and admiring every time he manages to get up and keep going.  The one criticism would be about the realism of all the misfortune, that befalls DiCaprio's character. There are points where it is really too much for one man to endure and the opinion of the antagonist, that "there is no way he could survive that" seems quite correct.  Another thing to note: this is not a film for the squeamish. The graphic, bloody scenes involving both humans and animals do not hold back in realism.Hollywood drivel Only in Hollywood could they take the life of Hugh Glass - a man whose story needs no embellishment to rate as "astonishing" - and subvert it to the point of disgrace. Using the rough outline of the Glass arc, this movie adds absurd and, more vitally, totally unnecessary plot lines about sex slave Indian daughters and martyred, fictional sons and all manner of other rote plot devices in order to - I guess? - try and dramatize a story about a guy who *literally* crawled 200 miles without skin on his back in order to save his own life. As if Hugh needed the posthumous help. Hardy might win an Oscar for his excellent performance as foil and I'm sure Leo will get plenty of hype for grunting his way through 150 minutes. But man, they're both just shadows cast behind a movie that could have been great. The writers could have fictionalized a plot loosely based on Glass's life and rightly called it fiction. Or they could have made a great movie about what actually happened and sold it as truth. Instead, they manage go wrong in both directions. "The Revenant" dishonors Hugh Glass, disrespects its audience, and desecrates a tale worth being told much better than this. Your time would be better spent sleeping inside a dead horse.Wow! A great movie to finish the year with. So when is DiCaprio going to win an Oscar already? This guy puts his heart and soul into every movie and he sure knows how to pick them. This is a movie that has a lot of heart and was terrific from start to finish. Tom Hardy also was terrific in this one. From the start I was riveted. If I didn't know this story was true I don't know how vested I would be in this, but knowing this story really happened it made the movie incredible. The camera work was brilliant and the CGI was tremendous in a great bear scene that will be talked about going forward. Don't miss this one if you can help it. This is about a man who overcomes adversity over and over again. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because 20 minutes could have been trimmed, but that about it. It is a must watch so get your popcorn and be amazed at the how this man lived in the 1830's and what he went through in a compelling story with great actors.Remarkable work by Leonardo DiCaprio,The Oscar Deserves Him Leonardo DiCaprio Himself Said The Revenant his 'most difficult film' But After Watchig This Movie I Asked Myself "Is There anything this guy can't do"? Great film has the power to convey the unimaginable. We sit in the comfort of a darkened theater or our living room and watch protagonists suffer through physical and emotional pain that most of us can't really comprehend. Too often, these endurance tests feel manipulative or, even worse, false. We're smart enough to "see the strings" being pulled, and the actor and set never fades away into the character and condition. What's remarkable about Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu's "The Revenant" is how effectively it transports us to another time and place, while always maintaining its worth as a piece of visual art. You don't just watch "The Revenant," you experience it. You walk out of it exhausted, impressed with the overall quality of the filmmaking and a little more grateful for the creature comforts of your life. So My Review 10/10 An extraordinary piece of work by Leo,director and rest of the cast,Must Watch GuysA true story, made original Really, what a wonderful experience. I was daunted by the film's duration. But after the first scene, I was applauding the DOP for his innovation and relationship with his subjects. At the very least, this film should be recognized by its' effective use of optic technology. Wow It was like II was there - a true advancement in the craft. A hard call between Leo De Caprio and Tom Hardy for Best Actor or Supporting role. You know from the first scene who to root for and who to despise. But something golden has to come of this triumph. I've honestly never experienced such an up-close-and personal sideline view of a series of events. Thank you for that. I was fortunate to have grown up close to where this film was shot. The locations are where I leaned how to camp, fish, ski, trek and teach my son to skate on a mountain lake with snow swept clear by the wind so you can see the fish 30 feet down. I would have given this movie a 10, but for a couple inaccuracies which I will not dwell on. Please enjoy his film and pass it on to friends. Ground-breaking cinematography, a truly compelling story and a truly committed effort by the actors. (I've been in that water and I'll tell you, Hell is cold).visceral experience from beginning to end The Revenant is definitely one of the best shot films of the year. Some of the camera moves are just extraordinary. The story is simple, but that's fine because it's the overall experience that's unique, not the premise. It's basically a revenge western meets a survival story. Set in frosty Montana, Hugh Glass must overcome all odds to avenge the death of his son. All the acting is great- but it's the mood that really stands out. From icy mountains, to great plains, the oppressive and gloomy atmosphere will not be for everyone. It's a hard film to sit through. There are scenes of great violence and very very slow-paced scenes. Plus the runtime is over two and half hours. So it might not be for everyone- but it's still an excellent film.Miserable; Not Only The Character's Life But The Film Too At 156 minutes, "The Revenant" is unwatchable, so it wasn't. After an hour, instead skipped to watch a minute every three or four through to the last twenty minutes which encapsulates the final conflict between John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Hugh Glass). Nothing was missed for in between is Glass grimacing left then right. There is a harrowing, savage bear attack leading to Glass hanging to life by a slender thread. Oddly, all that came to mind is how the effects were accomplished. That goes to a lack of empathy for protagonist Glass. This is a film of unquestioned artistic merit. Though some gush about the cinematography, it is merely serviceable. It's not the cinematography that's beautiful, it's the wilderness. All that's required of an available light cinematographer is to set the frame and F-stop. The actors most likely kissed pavement back in civilization after shooting this demanding film. They did well under the circumstances, particularly DiCaprio. The villain is the director and the unreachable allegory he wrote on the script pages. In "Jodorowsky's Dune," the titular director made a few memorable Seventies' films. When pitching "Dune," the studios requested a standard length film - 120 minutes (not viable for a film from a story this complex). But Jodorowsky wondered why it couldn't be ten hours or twenty hours. He was clueless why the studios weren't funding him. The doc is in part the story of a delusional, out-of-control ego. The viewer may wish to slap his face. Enter Alejandro González Iñárritu who also appears to have an ego of the same dimensions. God bless the artists, but not those who trade their expression for self aggrandizement. Not only is "The Revenant" a vanity project, it is Oscar bait. Awards should be given to those brave enough to sit through this slog. It is a simple story raised to the power of crashing bore. "The Revenant" is nearly incomprehensible, and filled with spiritual mumbo-jumbo even Iñárritu most likely can't explain. See this if you relish masochism. It's a bet this film will bomb. Maybe that will awaken Iñárritu. He's a genius. He just doesn't know how to connect with an audience. He certainly doesn't here.Great Movie Leonardo DiCaprio deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie. His part in this movie was very, very well played out, he made you feel that he was actually suffering from the pain that he received. Watching Leonardo go through things he did made you feel lucky that we don't need to live the way they did back then and fear that any moment, your life could end. Tom Hardy's role was also played well, watching his role, he made you feel that you need to jump through the screen to help Leonardo to seek his revenge. I will not say much, but I could watch this movie again. I know that this movie will be one of the best movies that will be out in 2016. This is a very must watch film. I will also give much of the credit to the Director for making this feel real.If this doesn't get Leonardo DiCaprio his Oscar, nothing will. I had the opportunity to watch The Revenant at an early press screening yesterday, and what an exceptional movie this is! You are on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film, Lubezki's cinematography is out of this world and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is absolutely riveting and Oscar-worthy. The naturalistic beauty of 17th century America that is visualized in this movie is beyond anything I've ever experienced in film. Hugh Glasses' story is a legendary one, and they couldn't have honored his legacy any better than this. Alejandro Iñárritu has outdone himself once again.Man in the Wilderness RIPOFF The movie is nothing more than a Hollywood ripoff. See "Man in the Wilderness". (1971). Starring Richard Harris and John Huston. This includes the bear attack and left for dead. An Absolute RIPOFF. Sorry this is a joke just like Leo for doing such a sham! The same can be said of Will Smith's I am Legend. A Hollywood Ripoff of the Omega Man. (1971). Starring Charlton Heston Anthony Zerbe. Right down to the zombies and his blood cure. When will Hollywood get through their heads that just changing the title and actors doesn't make this a different film. This is a ripoff of a classic film. Leo should be embarrassed!Best direction by Alejandro and great movie This movie was really good Leonardo DiCaprio did a really good acting it was really like a real scene was going on instead of a movie. It had some flaws like how could he survive bear attack and after that how can he survive the fall from the cliff but still it was a very good movie the direction was really amazing i mean like Alejandro did a great job every scar , every death , every place was captured in a really amazing manner .The story is very simple DiCaprio has his son killed by Tom Hardy and is left in a very bad shape and he recovers and takes his revenge but how he takes his revenge and his recovery (really i mean his recovery was very tragic) is just captured in a amazing way .This is a must watch ,this movie is a bit slow but it is worth it just go and see it.The closest visualization of the trip to hell and back I've ever seen in a movie The man on that very trip is Hugh Glass. This first paragraph is to give everyone a heads up as to what they should expect going in to this movie. For starters don't be expecting a action film, this is far from an action film. There are many down moments and many periods of time with little dialogue, if you are easily bored beware. Now on to the review of the movie. The first and foremost thing I will talk about is the cinematography. I swear to you that this film houses some of the best camera work I have seen in a movie, not to mention the difficulty of shooting in natural light on top of the tricky and great shots that they pulled off. The first battle scene between the Arikara and the fur trappers was filled with many great shots, not just long shots but very maneuverable shots. If this film doesn't take the Oscar home for best cinematography I would be very surprised. Hats off to Emmanuel Lubezki for he truly is a master of his craft and is on the top of his game in this one. It truly is a shame however that the score is unable to enter into the Oscar race, the way it pairs with the visuals work quite well. When it comes to the more intense scenes a very heart jolting percussive tune joins with it, in the smaller more beautiful moments of scenery are accompanied with a more orchestral type music. The music works quite well and I wished it could of at least of gotten a Oscar nod. Although I have stated this film isn't a action film it does have some very very well executed action sequences, the first encounter between the Arikara and the fur trappers was great. If you have scene the trailers you already know what I'm talking about. Another one would be when Hugh is running from the Arikara on a horse, and if you have seen the 50 second clip you know what I'm talking about. That is something that bothers me though is how they pack the trailer full of action and get viewers expecting something different that what is actually given, on top of that baiting a demographic that would most likely be disappointed. If you want to see the movie for the action you have the trailer and the clip which gives you almost all the action that is in the film. This film is about the journey Hugh Glass goes through and it portrays it without any sugar coating and in the end pays off quite well. The performances are very good as well. Tom Hardy and Leonardo Dicaprio are practical shove ins for nominations, I don't however think either one will win but would be pleasantly surprised if either one won. In conclusion the film is ultimately good but isn't for the action hungry, it is very technically well made and practically a guaranteed win for cinematography. The film wasn't as entertaining as I was hoping it would be and it may overstay its welcome a little long but the film quality doesn't disappoint, I would rate it an 8.5/10, thanks for reading my review and I hope you can enjoy the film.A brutal, harrowing, and visually stunning adventure film unlike anything that's been seen before The Revenant is Alejandro Iñàrritu's majestic revenge story set in the early 1800s that follows the larger than life true story of Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he travels across old America in hopes of exacting revenge against the men that left him gravely wounded and his son dead. The revenge story line is the oldest in the book and, no matter how overplayed, evokes the most emotion especially when the players are right. DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Will Poulter make for some pretty excellent players in Iñàrritu's more visual film and this allows audience members to connect with the film on a more accessible level rather than the cinephiles that this film was made for. Emanuel Lebezki has, yet again, outdone himself. The beauty in each frame is undeniable. The landscapes, the snow, the blood, the violence. No matter how harrowing a situation is, the film is still one of the most beautiful ever made and this is a testament to Lebezki and Iñàrritu. The patience they endured on set speaks volumes to the film that they made. The Revenant isn't fast paced, it isn't action packed, it is a story told through the eyes of a visionary and that may off put some people who are looking for a film like The Hunted or The Grey or any other man against wilderness film. The film is slow and takes it's time in giving the audience something they can sink their teeth into. Instead, they allow the audience to be submersed in this cold and desolate landscape, all while capturing the beauty of the American landscape. The battle scenes are epic. Mostly done through extended long takes, the film is a cinephile's dream. The camera movements, the tracking shots and that glorious bear attack are all beautifully done and shown in the most harrowing way possible. For a film to open with an over 10 minute long take of a battle nonetheless, it is truly captivating and awe inspiring to see filmmakers push themselves to their limits both physically and creatively. But as much as the filmmakers pushed themselves, so did the cast. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a brilliant performance as Hugh Glass. In films before, we've seen DiCaprio fake pain. In this film, you actually feel his pain. With every bite from a bear, every broken bone being reset, every wound being crudely stitched, his performance reeks of perfection and that is exactly what we get from him here. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald is a typical bad guy here, nothing more nothing less. He's good, he's not on the level of DiCaprio here though. The rest of the cast is amazing, as always with any Iñàrritu film. Overall, The Revenant is a brilliant film that isn't quite a masterpiece but has enough technical achievements within it to set it apart from any other film this year. I definitely recommend it.Hollywood meets Native Americans Yet another over the top movie with too many graphic effects and no substance. At the end of the movie, I just sat there wondering what the whole point of the movie was, because if I wanted to see raw violence, I would just go on the Ogrish website and watch the be-headings and other atrocities from ISIS. Perhaps it is this continuing pointless display of violence that causes the manifestation of all the violence in this world. For me, the movie went wrong as soon as the bear attack happened. Of course, only in Hollywood would it be possible to create an epic fight between a bear, four to five times the size of the pro/antagonist, yet with the bear still loosing the battle. What gives, though; as long as there is an epic CGI battle with blood splattering all over the screen, then the movie must be good. Truly disappointed in yet another Hollywood garbage movie that is meant to excite the Zombies here in America.Good start, but someone got arrogant, which made the movie absurd... I was lucky enough to watch this movie early and saw it without the knowledge that it was from the same director as Gravity and Birdman. The movie was good until the horse jumped off the cliff and into the tree. Looking at the end result of that stunt the director completely lost me as viewer. All the gravity the heavy story had; became an absurdity, which is an incredible shame. That single scene should have been edited out, which would have saved the story, because everything what happened afterwards became an irritating show-off of special effects (like The Hobbit trilogy) and no longer the gritty film what it was. The special effects are indeed amazing and you are very often left wondering how they have pulled that off; especially the bear scene. However, special effects shouldn't dominate the movie and the story should always come first! At the final scene it suddenly struck me that this was a movie from Alejandro Gonzalez Innarito, because it was such a signature of his. It is too bad he got too cocky here, because Gravity and Birdman were both beautiful masterpieces. The Revenant in its current form is definitely not a masterpiece unfortunately. Less would have most certainly been more in this case and I can only hope they revise this movie before release, trimming some unnecessary scenes out...Standard Hollywood script format, and what real story? The upsides to revenant --Lots of gritty action --Decent special effects --Good acting --Good cinematography --Good costumes --Downside, the entire script is based on knowing an audience's attention span is 15 minutes, make the story mesh for 15 minutes, and then you can start over from scratch, as long as you keep them engrossed in the action --The Pawnee, a Midwest tribe in Nebraska, ending up in the mountain ranges of British Columbia is ridiculous.  --The French traders are making a living trading fur with the Indians, but they kidnap a Pawnee Indian girl from one of the tribes they trade with and serial rape her, and kill a stray Pawnee Indian they come across (the french can verbally communicate with the Pawnee) and hang a sign on his body written in french (the Pawnee speak french), the whole thing was done to create an additional antagonist, Hollywood style. The reality is, people (even evil French), would never jeopardize their business and lives in this fashion.  --Our protagonist gets cold and manages to generate a fire with a flint and black powder, all well and good. THEN our protagonist is caught up in a river that is below freezing, he goes over waterfalls, through raging rapids, finds a tree piece to cling to and after several more minutes lands safely on land. The life expectancy for someone with a ravaged sickly body in such water is under 15 minutes. Our hero climbs onto shore, the camera pans somewhere else, and comes back to out hero with a blazing fire. EVEN if the guy still had some black powder (which he doesn't, he left it behind), it would never be able to start a fire with wet powder. --Our hero comes upon the French and sorta saves the Pawnee Indian girl (in British Columbia), and takes a good ole black powder pistol, maybe its a flintlock, maybe. In any event, he takes the pistol, and some how manages to get off 3-4 shots with that one shot pistol, taking down Bad guys while riding a horse. Then later he gets set upon by a pack of Indians, and gets off a few more shots, taking out Indians while riding horse back, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the SEMI AUTOMATIC black powder pistol(Glass was bear mauled in the 1820s, so it was a semi automatic cap and ball pistol folks). --Now we come to the climax. The bad guy runs off with the company money and two guys go after him. This is WITH the knowledge that the guy has taken everyone's pay, is heavily armed and the country side is crawling with misplaced enraged Pawnee tribes. TWO guys go out to get the baddee. Not likely, in reality the fort would have sent as many people as it could spare. I'm not going to bother to elaborate about the real facts of the Glass bear attack; that there was no revenge factor after Glass was mauled by a bear. He had no children. That he was in fact mauled during summer. That the colleagues of Glass killed the she bear and nursed Glass back to health, somewhere in the sunny midwest (not BC in the winter).  Finally, the movie does not say at the end that no animals were brought to harm, I know they used puppets and special effects in some cases for the animals, but if in fact animals were not brought to harm in the making of this movie, it WOULD say so in the credits.  -IE, animals were killed in the making of this movieWonderfully Crafted The Revenant is one of the most beautifully shot movies I have ever seen. The opening scene alone will make you wonder how the hell they did this. There are so many creative shots with sweeping camera angles and beautiful vistas. For that alone I'd recommend seeing it. As the story goes, its based on true event. The real story of Hugh Glass is an incredible story about the will to survive and the need for revenge. The Revenant portrays that very well. At times it's brutal, savage, and unforgiving, like what frontier life was probably like in the early 19th century. The acting is all well done, from Dicaprio as the lead to Hardy as the villain; they were all convincing. The only knock I have about this movie is the pacing and length. I knew going in being familiar with the story that there were going to be slow parts, a wounded man clinging to life and traveling through the wilderness was bound to have slow parts. Visually alone, I think most cinemaphiles will have a lot to like about this movie as well for people who are interested in the the time period. This film is certainly well made and the fact that they used only natural lighting adds to the already impressive production values.+Technical Mastery, -Synthetic Spirituality = Memorable Mediocrity My popcorn tin was heavier when I binned it than when I collected it. Why did I throw up when watching The Revenant? There isn't that much gore to speak of.. What's worth a loud unflattering speech is the wooden spoon of pseudo-philosophical pretensions AG Iñárritu gags the audience with for 2 hours and 26 minutes. I sat with that warm tin on my lap even through the 10 minute credits, contemplating. Consider that Glass' chief motivation for returning from the grave (gravely wounded really) is his love for his Pawnee son, with whom the only memorable scene shared is patting him down from an outburst against Fitzgerald's (Hardy) ferociously racist taunts. He only becomes that much close to him after Fitzgerald coats his rusty knife with the teenager's gastric juice, in a powerfully screamed-out scene. Consider how much running time we spend watching Glass wander wistfully into the afterlife, despite knowing full well he'll overcome his bear wounds for a showdown or the film wouldn't be funded. He eavesdrops on whispers by his murdered wife's wraith, only to wake up and cauterize his torn-open neck with gunpowder; Iñárritu wants to both have his bison liver and eat it. How much can you cheat the narrative?  Most redundant of its sophistry is the Darwinian symbolism, as Glass evolves from being bruised and buried, to a crawling creature, to a one-legged limper, to a biped man to a horseback riding gunfighter... In Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity, evolutionary symbolism at the end served a purpose of literalizing how survival is a prerequisite for evolution; we wouldn't be writing reviews on IMDb if Neanderthals hadn't scrambled Mousterian tools 300,000 years ago. Here, Glass gets wounded and persists only to become the same man again.... not even a wiser fellow. Above everything, the over-ballyhooed bear attack is dampeningly underwhelming. Not-to-spoil anything, but you remember it, how you give a cat a bowl of milk, the bowl gets swirled around a bit with only a few licks of milk spilling over the edges.. Yeah. Oh, it's not even all in one long continuous take as it's been touted to be, there's a very visible cut soon after Glass arms himself with a knife. What it isn't is even 1/10th as visceral as the jaguar-mauling from Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. What it is is ten times more pointlessly protracted and thusly expensive. On the other hand, The Revenant is filmed with such hypnotic beauty. Lubezki's camera floats around inordinately, (pans more than it tracks) and he seems to find heavenly imagery in every 360° plane. Nature has never looked better in a Hollywood production. There's a grim fairytale (&amp; Ron Fricke-esque) edge to the proceedings. The wide-screen frames are filled with towering forestry, snowmelt and dew drops dripping off the damp lushly colored leaves in close-up. Negatively charged oxygen reaches for your lungs off the screen. When the film slackens to luxuriate in wonder, never is it boring; it's only catching its breath. The editing is often fabulous. From flame-to-flame match cuts in the snow, and most memorably, Glass' labored breath fogs the lens, dissolves into clouds floating in the mountain ranges which are then viciously consumed by Fitzgerald's pipe smoke. But Ho! there... characters' lives are risked for this virtuosity. There's a scene in which Jim Bridger, the story's most conflicted entity, when finding their way to camp with Fitzgerald, happens upon a massacred Native village, huts still smoking. Him and us, (but not Fitzgerald) see a surviving lady, for whom Bridger leaves a parcel whose contents neither we nor her know to be; she's seen Fitzgerald stomp around and cuss, she's surmised his inclination towards violence. She has to choose between 1) staying safely alive by hiding a little longer, or 2) bowing to the logistical limitation of Iñárritu needing to pan around, show her to the audience discovering bread in the parcel and pinching off mouthfuls, then urgently cut to the next scene. Does she play it safe? Not if The Revenant is going to strike a balance between manipulative and masterful. Still, despite the objectionable, emetic and offensively on-the-nose endeavour, Iñárritu deserves an Oscar again, if only for the scene in which Glass eviscerates a dead horse he's ridden off a cliff, and the camera smoothly sails around from the horse's back as its viscera are scooped out, travels in a long take, timed to the action, to find Glass snuggling into its steaming 'womb' then conclude with a close-up of his face. Wow!! (No matter how many takes and fired crew members it took) The most human performance is by Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald, consistently flawed and gleaming with gallows humor. Don't be surprised if during the final snowy showdown, you're rooting for him to cut down pretentious. DiCaprio, well, he..... works the hardest. You know that clip they play at the Oscars, your most electrifying moment during a performance, DiCaprio's here is effectively a grisly series of those. My two favorite are him trying-to-not-blink to save his life, and him crawling out of a shallow snow grave, and mortared between his teeth, equal parts spit and grit. Despite my reservations, I'll cheer a lung out for either clip. You can almost hear the voices in his head (his Birdman?) yell in Calvin Candie rhetoric; "Eddie Redmayne, that new kid, he gimped hisself out last yur, won that Oscar for it.. What are you gonna do, Huh!?!" Such a troubled production, he ate real raw bison liver, yet still he required 5 stunt doubles and 3 photo doubles... that there is a metaphor for the whole movie. While the film is never boring, calling it entertaining would be flattering it. No exhilaration derives from watching a man ride a horse off a cliff; the experience is very akin to staring into an open wound, waiting patiently for it to a cicatrize into a scar. 7/10.If this doesn't get Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar win, I don't know what will. The terms "immersive" and "visceral" are often loosely used, but THE REVENANT has taken strong ownership of them, and all it takes is director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's sharp and creative directing and maestro cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's distinctive camera style and seamless edits that take us through the landscape, up close and personal. THE REVENANT is one of those films that will be talked about for generations to come, whether it be at a film school among students and experts or at a coffee shop among aficionados who've just seen one of the most incredible films ever. The character Hugh Glass is a legend when it comes to the history of the frontier, these are the times before the things we often associate with wild wild west. Writer/director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and co-scribe Mark L. Smith take source from Michael Punke's novel but they put a fictional twist of their own on this actual historical character, played in the film by the great Leonardo DiCaprio. In this film, Hugh Glass has a mixed race son because he was once had native-American wife, Glass and his son join fur-trapping business that got attacked by the natives, one of the people in their expedition is John Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy. One day, Glass gets mauled by a bear and left for dead by his team members. Fitzgerald is one of the three staying behind to care for Glass and to give him a proper burial should he passes. But Fitzgerald kills Glass' son and takes off instead, an event which then motivates Glass to survive in his relentless pursuit of revenge. Whether it be interior like "Birdman" or outdoors like "The Revenant," Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a director who's committed to taking the audience to fully experience because he understands the wide range and the scale and he also fully understands the stories of these characters and he smartly conveys them to you. Yes, it's a primal existential survival story, yes it's also a revenge and redemption story, yes it's also father and son story, but the way Alejandro films it, the way he tells it, makes THE REVENANT more nuanced than that. And just like how this film manages to transport you to a land and time that's rarely tackled in cinema, it also successfully transports visual spectacle to a new height that's never before seen nor felt. The sequence in which Leonardo DiCaprio's Hugh Glass gets mauled by a bear, for example, it's as if you could feel Glass and the bear's breath. This is also why Lubezki is one of the greatest of all-time because his cinematography aims to make you feel like you're present there, you see the angles, the edges of the screen, everything about it is very welcoming, very inclusive. This is Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance yet, one of the things that makes him a great actor is that he's clever in his rhythmical movement and facial expressions, he's on point, he knows how to make a scene more emotional or more intense, this is an actor who gives his all for his characters, and you see that dedication once again in THE REVENANT, working in toughest most uncomfortable conditions, he even strips down naked, Leo's devotion to this character, Hugh Glass, is admirable. Tom Hardy also gives an equally outstanding performance as the villain, Fitzgerald, who's only looking out for number one, what matters to Fitzgerald are himself and his ambitions, he doesn't have a problem with kicking integrity or honor to the curb if need be. And so when Hugh Glass ultimately gets in the way, it's kill or be killed mode for Fitzgerald and Hardy, with his sturdy intimidating stature, accomplishes that. THE REVENANT is a beautifully shot film, much of it will remind you of the works of writer/director Terrence Malick, whom Emmanuel Lubezki collaborated with several times including "The New World." There's something majestic, something grand about THE REVENANT and at the same time, there's also something inspiring and hopeful about it. THE REVENANT is a work of art, a masterpiece.Would be great without any actors at all - just scenery The stars of the movie is the scenery and the cinematography (even though I'd never want to go to any of those sites). It was beautiful in a way 'Dr Zhivago' was but the Russian epic had other things going for it too. The story was 'Tarantiono does Grisley Adams'. The violent opening scene is an echo of the starting scenes to 'Saving Private Ryan' - shocking violence, retelling what were once portrayed as bloodless. While this was an action movie it was no thriller. Knowing the running time and that some of the main characters had to die, was my guide but I wasn't invested in the outcome. The end came as a welcome relief and if they are editing for a shorter version - less DiCaprio would be my preference. The bears were beautiful and almost too believable with every hair distinguishable. I confess, I was rooting for the bear! Right was certainly on her side. Tom Hardy has had a hell of a few years from 'Loche', 'Peaky Blinders' and 'Legend'. He was easy to watch because his character clearly didn't give a '*&amp;%$'. D Gleeson was almost unrecognizable in 'Star Wars Ep VII' and is the new hope for gingers everywhere. Some people think the movie will have trouble making back the budget because the handsome stars keep their clothes on but in fairness, depressing doesn't sell. Look at 'The Road'! I say - imagine it without the woeful drama and just enjoy the majesty on the big screen For those of us who don't lead a charmed life like DiCaprio, we don't need to pay 6 -10 for another 3 hours of it. That's why Christmas is so popular - its an invitation to be happy.Is this Leo's Oscar home-run? With the Revenant you will join a group of world class actors and the rising stars on a cold, wet and bloody journey through natural lighted mountains, forest and swamps. (small 1st plot point spoilers possible) It's a simple story of a 'Dances of the Wolves' like man who lived among the "savages" and is showing the arrogant whites a save passage through enemy territory. It's a story of a man who's lost everything but his son, which he had with a beautiful Indian woman. A clearly ambitious Patrokles-like son, who is forced to keep his mouth shut in order to survive the hate of the whites. When the man loses his son, the problems begins - plot-wise. Since he's lost his only emotional connection, we don't get very much to know his character in later scenes anymore. And a death of a loved one might shock us for a moment, but as the character and as with every film and it's duration, we carry on. What can you offer me next? Unfortunately even the beautifully conceived wide angle mood shots can't pick up the slack. All acquaintances are short. It clearly overkills the dark, noirish conception of the character. Now I have no clue about the original source of material but a reinterpretation of it would have been good - something like a companion, or even an animal. Think of Dances with the Wolves and how the death of the wolve grabbed our emotional attention, after we've learned how the friendship was build. Another appropriate example might be Nicholas Wending Refn's Valhalla Rising. There again we have a buddy-movie like plot device - the boy, with whom the nameless fighter can connect and defend, which makes him at least more of a three dimensional, human killing machine. The revenant is plot driven, which is such a missed opportunity, because we actually are interested and care for the main character, but are left unsatisfied, and I mean not in a cliffhanger way of unsatisfied.  Mr. Iñárritu co-wrote the script with Mark L. Smith. Now I'm sure that there is a clear set of symbolism which might illustrate certain inner thoughts etc., but this should'nt have been conceived as an art housian film. It should have been written with clear cinematic language, with iconic symbols, with more emotion, rather than too much of the ultra realistic gore. Yes, animals died for this movie and it's absolutely justified in order to depict the survival in nature. Take it or leave it, but your chicken did not die of stroking. I picture a lot of fun and work in the production design process, but as so often today, the script wasn't ready yet and no one cared, because great actors signed in already. The script heavily relied on Hemingway's iceberg principle. Show the tip of the iceberg, the rest is imagination. Well, in this case the polished mood pictures just weren't sufficient for me. Seeing all the twitter reviews about the bad pacing only proofs my point. As film lovers we all know that film is never about the real-time, it's about emotional-time. Scarface is a near 3 hour epic but for us it feels like a short drug intoxication. Why? Because we don't feel the grass growing, but rather a light-speed trip to mars.  To close with a Oscar prediction: Sorry Leo, it ain't work this time. You gave a marvellous performance. You swallowed so much dirt, only Christian Bale can beat you with that. But your character lacked the emotional dept an audience needs that in order to be behind you. No Sir, it was not your preparation, not your dramatic art. Through the setting you were forced to suffer, but any actor in this role would have, so what was there to stand out? Unfortunately the soucre material did not allow you to go in for more.brilliant, just brilliant Alejandro González Iñárritu's masterpiece. a tour de force, if I've ever seen one. from the amazing opening shot, this movie immediately hooks you. the movie is a brutal depiction of man against the wild. a survivalist story that can sometimes be difficult to watch or even stomach, as some of the scenes can be quite gruesome. the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are spectacular. Leonardo, who doesn't speak much threw out the movie, depicts Hugh Glass's pain and suffering with the skill of a true thespian grand master. Tom Hardy is chameleon. he is able to lose himself in a character in such a way that unless you know it's him acting the part, most people would never know it was him. all in all this was a great story. just prepare to lose yourself for about two and half hours. I assure you, it will be well worth the time.The Wonderful Visuals Bring the Film to Life The Revenant (2015)  *** 1/2 (out of 4)  Visually striking drama/action film about guide Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) who crosses a grizzly bear and is seriously wounded. Before long the man (Tom Hardy) left back to protect him leaves him to do as well as taking away someone very close to Glass, which leads to a tale of revenge. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has quickly become one of the greatest directors in regards to visuals and it pretty much happened over his last two movies including this. As with last year's BIRDMAN, this film here takes the director's visual style to a whole new level and it helps create a rather unique and original looking film that takes on a subject that has been told before but it works. I say this type of story has been done before and it has countless times. With that said, more than likely the majority of people watching this film hasn't seen the story before because we really haven't seen this type of Western in several decades. I think it's fair to call this a Western but it's rather hard to imagine the Indian massacre, the bear battle or the intense ending not making this a Western in its own way. The strongest thing about this film are the visuals but we've also got a couple excellent performances from DiCaprio and Hardy. Both men are wonderful in their roles and this is especially true for Hardy who is just so cold blooded and evil that you can't help but want to see him in a lot of pain. The actor does a marvelous job building up this character without too many words but when he does say something it rings right through you. As for DiCaprio, I'm not going to lie but he's one of my favorite actors and he has been since I first saw him in THIS BOY'S LIFE back when it was released. I don't think this is one of his greatest performances but he is still wonderful here and especially since he has to do the majority of the acting with his eyes. The film's settings are another major plus as you really do feel and believe what you're seeing on the screen. The director does an excellent job at making you feel everything that the lead character feels and this includes the now already legendary bear attack. The film's brutal violence is another major plus because it just makes everything seem a lot more realistic. THE REVENANT is certainly one of the most beautiful looking movies you'll see from 2015 and it has two great actors delivering excellent performances.Survival A favorite era of mine for film stories has always been the mountain man era in the American west. No white people in great numbers, just single shot weapons, they were the ones outnumbered so survival against the Indians was far more an even struggle than in the post Civil War west. The Revenant by dint of its many nominations has laid claim to being the greatest film about that era ever made. It goes up against such items as Across The Wide Missouri, The Big Sky, and Mountain Men, Jeremiah Johnson all pretty good films. It would have been hard to deny Leonardo DiCaprio a Best Actor Oscar this time around. He's on screen for most of the time and with minimal dialog DiCaprio has to use facial expressions and body language to convey his emotions. He does it well and should share his Oscar with the cameraman who did all those closeups of him. The plot is best compared to another mountain man picture A Man Called Horse that starred Richard Harris. DiCaprio who was guide to the expedition of fur trappers is badly mauled by a grizzly bear and is after being toted for quite a distance is abandoned by Tom Hardy who claims he died. DiCaprio just wants to settle the score. Unlike Richard Harris he does not find a friendly tribe of Indians to take him in. His survival is his personal story. The Revenant also won the Cinematography Oscar for the shooting of the rugged winter country these men are in. It's so good the landscape, cold and forbidding, becomes almost a character in the film. Like The Old Man And The Sea was for Spencer Tracy The Revenant is a personal film for Leonardo DiCaprio. Unlike Tracy who had that magnificent speaking voice for the narration, no narration here. Just anguished expressions convey what DiCaprio is feeling. Leo got his Oscar and it was a deserved one for The Revenant. It's a great film, but very brutal at times.Absolutely brilliant, one of Iñárritu's and Di Caprio's best 'The Revenant' to me is one of 2015's best films and deserved its hype, its critical acclaim justified. It is easy to understand why the audience reaction is more divided, but to me the low ratings are too harsh. The visuals, direction and acting are so brilliant that even if the film didn't impress me it still would have gotten no lower than a 4 or 5. Its best assets are the visuals and direction. Simply put, 'The Revenant' is one of the best-looking films of the year and a thing of sheer beauty. The settings are rich in atmosphere and the lighting remarkably natural, but it's the cinematography that shines brightest, it's both intimate and immersive. Iñárritu's direction is even better than in his outstanding direction in 'Birdman', some of the best direction of the year. Acting is marvellous, everybody showing great commitment. Leonardo Di Caprio got his only Oscar for his performance here and it was more than well deserved in one of his best films and performances, a performance of emotional intensity and honesty that is most agonisingly poignant. Tom Hardy excels in bringing brooding menace to his role, and Will Poulter is impressive too. 'The Revenant' has much more to it than those things. The action is brutally tense and the story, while deliberately paced and very simple, immerses the viewer in how gripping it is, being intense and emotional. The characters are strongly realised. Film fares least in the script which is not bad at all but occasionally a little garbled. This is such a minor criticism however and not enough to bring down my rating. In conclusion, brilliant film. 10/10 Bethany Coxbeautifully shot Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a frontiers guide with his half-Indian son Hawk. Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) had sent out a hunting party for fur pelts led by Glass. The group is attacked by Arikara party led by Elk Dog searching for his daughter Powaqa who was kidnapped by two white men. The survivors retreat to their boat. Elk Dog gives chase thinking Powaqa is held prisoner by Glasses' group. Glass decides to lead the men over land despite disagreement from John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). Glass is attacked by a bear leaving him half-dead. The men refuse to follow Fitz and leave him behind. Iñárritu's visual style is impeccable. Tom Hardy's acting is great. DiCaprio wins a lifetime Oscar award. This thing starts out like a roaring train culminating in the bear attack. It does get a little messy after that. While Tom Hardy is great, the movie should follow solely DiCaprio after the bear attack. It also has a convenient encounter with Powaqa. This should be simpler and end with a simple mano a mano fight. I do love the trick that Glass plays on Fitz.Handsomely made, compelling in its brutality, but narratively a bit too simple It is good to be wary around this time of year because with the Oscars and many other awards imminent, there is a tendency for studios to release 'worthy' films – many of them are really good too, but a lot of them are 'worthy'. It is hard to say which one The Revenant is, but it does certainly seem like a film where everyone went through a lot of physical hardship. I don't read around films much, so I'm guess on that, but the on-location shoot and freezing conditions seem too tangible for them not to have made the shoot a long and challenging one. If so then it paid off because this aspect of the film is by far the strongest element – the brutality, the fight for survival, and the contrast of these tiny people against the vastness of the landscape. As such it is the technical delivery which is really the star. It is a consistently impressive and handsome film - whether it is the CGI bear of the opening 30 minutes, or cinematography which manages to have both nimble movement in/around the action as well as taking in the sweeping vistas as it reproduces the cold onto the screen. This aspect of the film carries it a long way, because for the most part this is a dialogue-free affair as Glass pulls himself from death to try and get revenge on another character. As a journey it is a tough slog and unfortunately it partly becomes that for the viewer too, because the film does have a slow pace and is essentially a slow crawl to its target. It does enough with the atmosphere to ensure the viewer is in the mindset where this works well, but it is not the type of film that one would throw on for a relaxing Friday night in. It is an odd feeling, but for me the time did not drag, and I was help by its single minded and consistent brutality, but at the same time it was not a story I felt gripped by in the detail of the character – more the overall experience. The story does have the constant theme of parents and children. Of course this is the motivation for the revenge plot, but it is also behind the group of Native Americans who are also integral in the film; and of course the bear attack itself is a parent acting in defense of its cubs. This element is interesting but it doesn't always work. In the main plot it feels just like a plot device (which it is) and the floaty other-worldly connection to the dead wife doesn't chance that. The other father, hunting his daughter, doesn't bring a great deal to the film in terms of emotional content and, being honest, the only parent/child relationship that I really felt for was the bear cubs left behind by the death of their mother (I know, typical liberal watching people die but getting teary over the animals). The cast match the sense of brutality, and they wear it well in their characters. DiCaprio of course gets the headlines, but others are just as strong and one could argue that Tom Hardy really gets the best of the film as he gets all the good lines, has the most tangible character, and where the film has standout scenes, he is mostly in them. The technical delivery is the overall star though, because it is a film that is handsome, very well made, and has a lot to like in the look, atmosphere and sound work throughout. In this way it is more than worth a look, and it is compelling in what it does, even if at the same time it is not as strong in the characters and their stories as it is in the creation of this atmospheric struggle to survive.One of the finest survival films in recent history After winning 3 major Oscars last year, it did not take writer and director Alejandro González Iñárritu to come up with his next work that garners major awards attention. Recently, he won Best Drama Movie and Best Director at the Golden Globes for "The Revenant". Also it looks like this is finally the movie that gives Leonardo DiCaprio his first Academy Award. It is a pretty long film, runs for over 150 minutes and takes place in snowy America. The first parts of the film show us a group of fur traders. When the central character is attacked by a bear, they decide to leave him back and the film is basically split into two different parts: Glass' fight for survival and what the other gang members are doing at the same time. These include Tom Hardy's character, the main antagonist. I found him interesting to watch too. It becomes obvious how he is not only ruthless and greedy, but also how he is somewhat of an outsider in the group with the other people mostly admiring Glass for his perseverance. Also the scene when the young guy threatens him with his gun is pretty memorable. After Fitzgerald realizes the gun won't fire and it was never his intention to kill him, he lets him live too. A multi-layered character. Not just pure evil. Lets take a look at DiCaprio now. It is basically a 100% physical performance, almost non-verbal. He speaks only very few words in this film, occasionally in Indian. His scene with the bear mauling him is certainly among the most memorable of the cinema year 2015. Very tough to watch, yet it's equally difficult to look away. His scenes with his Indian pal or the Native American references in this film could have been better in my opinion and did not really make an emotional impact on me. Nonetheless, the people behind this film succeeded with the really difficult task of making a film this long that does not (or almost never) drag at all. It is also one of these films that you should really watch on the big screen if you have the opportunity. The cold, bare, mean snowy landscapes make this very atmospheric. Will Emmanuel Lubezki win a third Oscar in a row for his work here? It certainly seems a possibility right now. Even if I would not rank this movie among the very best of 2015 for me, it was still a thrilling watch for the most part and DiCaprio's performance alone makes it worth the watch. Also always nice to see Domhnall Gleeson such a good guy like he does in here. I like him as an actor. Back to Leo, the last shot on his face was truly memorable when we see him look right at the camera. Very very haunting. Go check it out.Original, Fascinating, Brutal and Realistic with another Great Performance of Leonardo DiCaprio In the Eighteenth Century, in Louisiana, a group of fur hunters under the command of Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) is attacked by Arikara Indians and the few survivors escape by boat through the Mississippi. The experienced hunter Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), who knows the area since he was married with an Indian and lived with her in her tribe, feels that the Arikara are following the boat and tells that it is better off hiding the fur and walk along one week to their fort through the mountains. However Glass stumbles with a grizzly bear and is severely wounded before killing it. He is carried in a stretcher and the hunter John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) suggests killing him since he is near-death, but Henry offers an amount to the man that stays with him. Glass's Indian son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and the teenager Bridger (Will Poulter) offer to stay and Fitzgerald, attracted by the award, also volunteers to stay. However he tries to kill Glass and stabs to death Hawk. When Bridger that was fishing returns, Fitzgerald lures him telling that twenty Arikara are coming and he does not know where Hawk is, forcing Bridger to leave Glass behind. Now Glass begins his dangerous journey of returning alone to the fort seeking revenge against Fitzgerald.  "The Revenant" is an original, fascinating, brutal and realistic film with another great performance of Leonardo DiCaprio. Supported by wonderful landscapes and the music score of Ruiji Sakamoto, the viewer does not feel the 156 minutes running time in a perfect pace balancing drama and adventure. The scene of the struggle between Glass and the grizzly bear is impressively real and mesmerizing. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Regresso" ("The Return")Will Leo Finally Win? A frontiersman (Leonardo DiCaprio) on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team. The story of Hugh Glass has gone through a number of revisions in the last two hundred years. There is first of all the true story, which could never be known -- Glass himself likely embellished or mis-remembered certain details. We then have various biographies, a novel, and an earlier film "Man in the Wilderness" (1971). Surprisingly, the latter has never had a home video release. This seems like the optimal time to cash in. But that is neither here nor there. In this latest version, Glass has a son, which increases the emotional factor. Is it historically accurate? No. But we should not allow the facts to get in the way of a good story. With the Academy Award nominations out, "The Revenant" has become the film to beat in a variety of categories. With twelve nominations, it is certain to win a few. And the big buzz is that this is the year that Leonardo DiCaprio will take home his first statuette. DiCaprio has been in the acting game for about thirty years and has had countless memorable roles. Some are more serious than others, but he has always done a fine job, even if the films did not call for such professionalism. And as Hugh Glass, this is no doubt the finest performance of his career. Through much of the film, he is left unable to speak and his acting must come out non-verbally, which is considerably more challenging. But winning the award is not supposed to be about an individual actor's best role, but about the best role of the year. Even by those standards, the odds look good. Eddie Redmayne and Bryan Cranston are formidable, and Michael Fassbender is a potential winner (even if he looks nothing like Steve Jobs). But did anyone throw themselves in a role as deep as DiCaprio? Probably not. Tom Hardy, who plays the antagonist, is up for a supporting actor award. By all means, he deserves it. His devilish Fitzgerald is every bit as good as DiCaprio's Glass, and in some ways even more fun to watch. He is a morally reprehensible monster. But the competition in this category is a bit steeper because of a very unlikely opponent: Sylvester Stallone. Few people would consider Stallone a great actor, but he is getting many accolades for "Creed". He also has another factor on his side: the subjectivity of Oscar voting. The voters will often vote less on the individual roles and sometimes on an actor's career, especially later in their life. This could be Stallone's chance at a lifetime achievement Oscar. So, hardy deserves to win, but he is not guaranteed by any means. There are a handful of nominations in makeup, costume and production which could get a win. One of the strongest aspects of the film, though, is Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography. This is a tough category, because you have the incredible Roger Deakins and a bold 70mm look on "Hateful Eight". But Lubezki is right now the man to beat. He has eight nominations to his credit, and has won the last two years (for "Gravity" and "Birdman"). And, frankly, this might be his best work yet. There are some long fight scenes that are reminiscent of Seamus McGarvey's work in "Atonement" (2007). Could Lubezki win three years in a row? Could be. All that praise aside, there is one category that the nomination was quite wrong: Best Visual Effects. The film has a notorious bear-mauling scene. And while the effects are quite good, there is never any doubt that the bear is a computer simulation. A very nice one, but still fake just the same. And that may take the audience out of the movie a bit, as this otherwise excellent look at the wilderness has a very modern image of a bear transposed in it... This award may end up going to "Star Wars" regardless, as it tends to be the category for awarding movies otherwise not considered Oscar-worthy. In short: is this DiCaprio's best role? Yes. Also possibly Tom Hardy's best role. And some excellent cinematography. Movie of the year? Perhaps, or perhaps not.Mostly Gut Wrenching but Also, a Bit Simplistic I just finished reading a series of commentaries by people giving this movie a single star. Take your hatred elsewhere. If you didn't like the film, fine, but because it got hype, it's not your job to lower its rating; it's your obligation to say something intelligent about the filmmaking. This is one of the most visually striking features I've ever seen. The camera angles and the framing of the scenes is spectacular. During the first scene ambush, we get to see what it must be like to suddenly be in the middle of a maelstrom. Arrows are frequently seen as sterile in most films. Here, we get a taste of them being a kid of artillery. LIke "Deliverence," which is another unsettling film, these guys are just in the wrong place. Whether those furs were worth a lot or not, all their work wasn't worth it. Yet, from what we hear, they are people who are the dregs of society and need something to keep them going. Yes, when DeCaprio shows up, we began to see men who, despite their oaths, will look after their own butts. Honor only goes so far in this universe. The story of Hugh Glass is part of history. I, like many others, question the extent to which this guy is pushed to the limits (a lot of Hollywood gimmickry). It takes some real skill to deal with real historical figures. I doubt that a third of this happened. I do know that Hugh Glass was mauled by a bear and that he literally crawled across three states to get revenge. Had he been totally fictional, we would be much more forgiving. In this case, less would have been more, with some compactness and restraint. I will leave it to the experts to get at the technical stuff. This is a highly entertaining film. Anyone that gives it one star is just being spiteful. I suppose they don't like DeCaprio. One even criticized the fact that it took place in the early 1800's.The Revenant The definition is "revenant": 1) a person who returns, 2) a person who returns as a spirit after death; ghost, I was excited about this film months before its release, even more when it received award nominations and wins, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director Alejandro González Iñárritu (Amores Perros, Babel, Biutiful, Birdman). Based on a true story, set in 1823, in the unsettled wilderness of the Louisiana Purchase, quasi-military hunting party of trappers and hunters, commanded by Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), are hunting for pelts. The hunting party are ambushed by hostile Native American Arikara Indians, only half of the party escape on one of their rafts, they salvage as much as they can while still under fire from the attacking Arikara, Henry knows they will still be pursued. The party are further slowed down when experienced hunter Hugh Glass (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Leonardo DiCaprio) becomes separated from the others, he stumbles on a mother grizzly bear and her cubs, the enraged grizzly savagely attacks him, Glass eventually kills the bear, but he is left severely injured and nearly dead himself. The hunting party can only provide rudimentary medical care, they take wounded Glass with them, but he is on a makeshift stretcher, slowing them down, finally one of the party, John Fitzgerald (Oscar nominated Tom Hardy), suggests killing Glass. Initially Henry tries to kill Glass himself, but is unable to do so, instead he offers payment for several men to stay behind with Glass, only Glass' son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and young Jim Bridger (Son of Rambow's Will Poulter) volunteer, Henry ups the reward when Fitzgerald mentions the likelihood of the boys and Glass being killed, Fitzgerald volunteers also. Fitzgerald promises Henry to stay with Glass until he dies and give him a proper burial, but once separated from the hunting party Fitzgerald tries to kill Glass, who cannot speak while wounded, by smothering him, Hawk stumbles on this, and Fitzgerald kills him while Glass watches in agony, Bridger returns and Fitzgerald claims he does not know where Hawk is, and makes up seeing Indians, though Bridger is hesitant he agrees with Fitzgerald to leave Glass behind, leaving behind a canteen with a carved spiral on it. Glass, put in a shallow grave covered in earth, finds strength, though struggling to recover, to crawl away, walking through the woods and surviving feeding on roots, the same Arikara who attacked earlier are tracking him, the chief is looking for his kidnapped daughter, Glass narrowly avoids a confrontation at the river by floating down the rapids. Meanwhile Henry and the surviving hunting party have reached their nearly dilapidated barracks outpost, Fitzgerald and Bridger make their way to the outpost, Bridger realises Fitzgerald was lying to leave Glass behind, Fitzgerald intimidates him into keeping silent, and when they reach the outpost Fitzgerald tells Henry that Glass died and Hawk disappeared, Henry gives him his reward, Bridger refuses his payment. Glass encounters Hikuc (Arthur RedCloud), a friendly Native American, who like him seeks revenge, the Pawnee builds Glass a shelter during a blizzard, and the next morning Glass finds his friend hanged, he was murdered by French pelt hunters camped nearby, he rescues an Indian girl being raped, this is in fact the kidnapped daughter of the chief, he takes the Pawnee's horse that the French hunters stole, he accidentally leaves behind the canteen with the spiral carving. Glass encounters the Arikara, but escapes falling off a cliff, killing the horse and wounding himself further, Glass keeps himself warm during the night in the hollowed horse corpse, while back at the outpost a lone hunter is found carrying the canteen, a search party is organised, Fitzgerald realises Glass must still be alive, so he empties the outpost safe and flees. Henry's group eventually find Glass and bring him back to the outpost, furious Henry fails in finding Fitzgerald in a search, Glass assures Henry that Bridger was lied to, and is released from imprisonment for treason, Henry intends to bring back Fitzgerald dead or alive, Glass insists on coming with him. Henry and Glass split up to approach Fitzgerald from separate angles, but Fitzgerald ambushes and kills Henry, Glass finds him deceased, but sets up a trap to trick Fitzgerald, he gets shot in the shoulder, Glass chases him to the river bank where they fight. Glass stops himself killing Fitzgerald, remembering words from the Pawnee, so he instead pushes heavily wounded Fitzgerald downstream, into the hands of the approaching Arikara, the chief, with his daughter returned, kills Fitzgerald and spares Glass, in the end Glass has completed his revenge, but his flashing visions of his dead wife and son will remain. Also starring Paul Anderson as Anderson, Kristoffer Joner as Murphy, Joshua Burge as Stubby Bill, Lukas Haas as Jones, Brendan Fletcher as Fryman and Duane Howard as Elk Dog. DiCaprio as the shaggy frontiersman gives a superb award winning performance as the real man struggling through savagery and harsh conditions, Hardy is also fantastic as the menacing villain who leaves him for dead, the supporting stars are good too. This true story set in the wilderness of 1820s America, about revenge, redemption and survival is astonishing, watching the man alone fighting to stay alive, and punish those who betrayed him, with fantastic cinematography, natural lighting and intense emotion, it is a brilliant must see historical revenge adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Original Music for Ryuichi Sakamoto and Carsten Nicolai and Best Makeup and Hair, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. Outstanding!Leonardo DiCaprio said what needed to get said "The Revenant" marks a big turn for both star Leonardo DiCaprio and director Alejandro González Iñárritu. Following up on his roles as maniacal tycoons in "Django Unchained" and "The Wolf of Wall Street", DiCaprio plays a fur trapper abandoned in the snowed-in wilderness. It's intense enough knowing that this was a true story, but how they film it makes it even more so. Like "Birdman", the movie contains several long shots filmed in a naturalistic style to create a sense of realism. Hugh Glass's determination to survive and find those who abandoned him provides one of the most harrowing stories ever put on screen. Covered in blood, sweat and dirt, DiCaprio spends much of the movie not talking, keeping the focus on his actions. And by actions, I mean that you rarely see something this intense on screen. I'd say that the movie deserved its Golden Globe wins (but it repeatedly irritated me that the presenters kept mispronouncing Alejandro González Iñárritu's name). And while accepting his award, DiCaprio spoke up for the world's indigenous peoples and called on people to protect the environment from corporate interests. Indeed we should heed his call. In the meantime, definitely see "The Revenant". It's an experience like you can't imagine.** What was all the hype about regarding this colossal miserable film? The film starts off too brutal for me with the Indians on the rampage, killing off many of the traders. Am still wondering why Leonardo Di Caprio won the best actor Oscar for this film? He gave many other much better performances in other films. The choice was ridiculous. The one shining spot of this horrible film was the supporting performance by Tom Hardy as the villain, who justified his evil ways by way of religion. This basically comes down to revenge and it's amazing that DiCaprio could ever survive the mauling by that bear to regain the stamina needed to track down Hardy, who had killed his son in the interim. Yes, the scenery is unusual but it best reflects the mood of the entire film.A gripping tale of survival and revenge Hugh Glass is working as a guide for a group of trappers when they are ambushed by a group of native Arikara who are looking for their chief's kidnapped daughter. The surviving trappers along with Glass and his son escape down river but not long afterwards Glass is horrifically mauled by a bear. He manages to kill it but only just survives. While the main party go ahead to get help Glass is left with his son and two of the trappers. Fitzgerald, the elder trapper thinks they should leave him despite being paid a bonus. When he thinks they are alone he tries to smother Glass but is stopped by his son who he then murders. Glass is then left all alone in the wilderness and isn't expected to last more than a few hours however he does survive and struggles back to health and starts to make his way back to Fort Kiowa. He will have a struggle to find anything to eat and must cross hostile territory to get there; it will test him to the limit of his endurance. Meanwhile Fitzgerald has made it back to Fort Kiowa and has told everybody he did everything he could to save Glass; when Glass finally gets there he will want his revenge. Like so many stories 'based on real events' a little bit of reading suggests quite a few liberties have been taken with the actual facts that doesn't matter too much though as this is still a fine story. The opening ambush is exciting and quickly got me gripped. The story got even more tense afterwards. The bear attack was brilliantly shot in a way that made it look very real and very brutal. Once he is alone in the wilderness the film perfectly captures the bleakness of terrain; you can almost feel the cold as Glass struggles through snow, icy water and even shelters inside the remains of a dead horse. The cast does a fine job; it isn't surprising that Leonardo DiCaprio earned an Oscar for this he did a great job as Glass and certainly suffered for his art in the freezing conditions. The rest of the cast are impressive too; especially Tom Hardy, who plays the villainous Fitzgerald. At two and a half hours this certainly isn't a short film but at no time did I find myself looking at the clock. Overall I'd certainly recommend it although some of the more violent scenes might bother some viewers."As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight". There aren't many moments in the movie that aren't intense as hell. The brutality of the Indian attack that opens the story is barely over when the picture launches into the media hyped bear attack on the principal character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. I'm not a fan of his but I can recognize the amount of effort that went into this role, and so I feel his Best Actor award is well earned. Before the Oscars were announced I had a feeling the picture would take the top award as well, that was before I saw the film. I can see how this movie might not have been at the top of Academy members' voting lists. It's not an easy picture to watch, as many of the scenes like the one showing the results of the bear mauling are cringe worthy. It reminded me of the wounds in "The Passion of the Christ" and leaves you wondering how mere mortals could possibly survive them even in normal conditions, let alone the harsh environment trapper Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) found himself in. One's attention as the viewer is constantly reminded of the unforgiving nature of the terrain Glass must fight his way through to seek vengeance on the man who left him for dead. The entire picture is a testament to one man's perseverance, exemplified by Glass's own words in my summary line above.Body&amp;mind;&amp;Heart; A masterpiece This is an amazing movie about human emotions and their results on our body. If you are interested to see someone who lives by using his body, mind and heart it's a master piece. Even though the word in the title "The revenant " has nothing to do with the word "revenge" it is about taking revenge. Through the film I was full of emotions of taking revenge but the film ended in such a perfect way that my all mindset is changed. As I was grown up with Turkish culture in which people even kill each others for generations long to take their revenge, this film changed my way of thinking. It's a long film but woth every second of it.Great Western The Revenant is an unusual movie in a way that makes you look at the nature in awe and fear at the same time as sitting on the couch. Which I think is hard to achieve. And Leonardo Di Caprio is an unlikely character to appear in a western (remember the soft spoken guy in "Titanic"). I had some doubts before, but he pulled it off. I very much enjoyed his opponents acting too. This film contains just the right amount of violence to make it believable. It's quite long too, without becoming boring - another achievement. Action is subtle, yet compelling. As usual, I would've have liked to have seen some characters survive, but yet they perished untimely.one of the best films The Revenant (2015) is a very beautifully crafted film featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, and Will Poulter; this is quite possibly one of the top films created in 2015. Christmas 2015 we at WoodBangers Entertainment got the honor of checking out The Revenant (2015) and it was well worth the opportunity. The Revenant (2015) releases January 7th and 8th in the U.S. and I'm sure everyone who sees it will not be let down. This film has an amazing cast, a great story-line, cinematics which will blow your socks off; it's a perfect film. So starting out 2016 with The Revenant, I'd say is a hope for a better year in film, check out The Revenant (2015) the moment you have the chance.Best movie of 2014 I really don't like giving 10/10 points, because almost every film could be better in some way. Put simple: this one couldn't get better. Quite the easy storyline packed in breathtaking pictures, dramatic scenes and heart-stopping moments. DiCaprio and the producers managed to make you feel the pain, the hunger, make you feel uncomfortable, cold and hurt in your comfy seat. It makes you want to give the actor on the screen a warm blanket. The movie pulls you into the harsh wilderness, shows you the beauty and horror of untouched nature. This, by far is my best movie 2014. It should get an Oscar, but even if not, DiCaprio can be proud of doing his best work yet.The Revenant! First of all the description of ''The Revenant'' makes you all excited and ready for an adventure epic western drama thriller.  Inarritu's decision to shoot the film chronologically was a good call telling the story from the beginning to the end. His ability and follow- up to Birdman does not disappoint. The amazing shots of every scene, every breath of Glass, every fight, struggle, survival on set makes him one of the greatest of all time. Definitely after this I'm going to watch more of his work.  DiCaprio DiCaprio DiCaprio... where to begin? He has definitely proved once and for all who runs this. The pain that he reflects, the scene with the bear the screaming, the scars and hope to make it another day, horse scene where he sleeps on his carcass to the fight scenes and eating real bison liver he really committed to this performance. He wasn't playing Glass - HE WAS GLASS. There is not enough words from the training and prepare of mastering guns, western lifestyle, the look to the accent and rawness of his character he topped Wolf of Wall Street and that was some of his best work congrats man hats off to you. Tom Hardy's performance wasn't unnoticed. He showed us one more ti how well he can manage to play a supporting character and that he's good at it unfortunately Leo's performance I think it shadowed him but there's a great possibility he'll grab an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actor. Will Poulter's performance as a scary trying to be honest but coward was just another point to making the film complete.  I waited for this film almost 2 years to come out and see it ever since it was announced. Don't Miss it cause there's not enough space for me to write a well-deserved review for this . 10/10 and I'm sure it's gonna win at least 5 Oscars ;) .Epic masterpiece worthy of every award it wins. spoilers, sorry. Title says it all, tied with 2 others for best movie I've seen in a decade? I do watch them, movies, sometimes, just this one is so vastly superior. 20/10 I honestly didn't think I'd like it, Mr. DiCaprio isn't a fav and the premise seemed weak to me, I've lived sorta close to this kind of experience before, so it's kinda old-hat to me. And then I watched it twice. I did not waste my time, I had to watch it again, it was just that good. I do gotta say that the lack of concern about staying wet and cold bothered me a lot. I got moderate hypothermia one spring when I was a teen by falling asleep with no blankets or padding on the floor of a concrete porch at 5-7 Celsius, and the hero goes over a waterfall series and then floats for what seems like hours, then doesn't even light a fire and get dry right away before it fades to black on him? First watch through, I swore he was a gonna, no doubt in my mind.ANd I still couldn't blink. But the whole cast and crew deserve an Oscar each, pulling off that level of "I can't take my eyes off it even to blink" in SPITE of an issue that for me would normally kill my interest marks this truly one of the best flicks ever. I'm even gonna push this one on my unsuspecting friends. They'll thank me for it, I'm sure. ANd I am a very harsh critic who is normally silent, particularly about this sort of film,but I logged in here just because I had to comment somewhere about this real modern marvel of the world. Must have been filmed somewhere near BC, Canada, this looked just like my backyard 5 years ago, and my experiences were based in a valley coulda been the one he drinks water from that first time, I honestly couldn't tell the diff.one of the most breathtaking films you will see If you think gladiator was a epic film then this film will blow you away! The true story of explorer hugo glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) who was attacked by a bear and left for dead by his own team and if that was not enough his confidant (Tom Hardy) betrayed him in a sinister twist. The sheer grit and dertimination by hugo to return to his family barely alive is a tribute to the actual events of this true story. This is one of the most compelling storytelling ever done on the big screen its brutal and some parts hard to watch like the bear attack but my god its got to be one of the best films i have seen ever. You become so involved in this film it truly grabs at your soul and you feel the struggle hugo goes through, Tom Hardy is brilliant but Leonardo DiCaprio is out of this world by just how amazing he portrays hugo, how he to this date has not won a Oscar is a biggest mystery ever! He has to win everything at the Oscars with the revenant. You may look away when you see a run time of 156 minutes but trust me you will not be sacrificing over 2 hours of your life. The story, plot screen shots ,camera angles everything about this film is brilliant there are not enough words to explain how great it really is. #leoforoscarsBreathtaking Piece of Cinematic Perfection There are few movies out there that people usually refer to as a "film". This is one of those movies. Calling this a film is actually an understatement. It is an absolute masterpiece in terms of cinema. The cinematography is masterful. The acting is masterful. The realism and grittiness of it just draws you in and keeps you there for the whole run time. I see a lot of complaints about the plot, and I understand why many people would think that it doesn't fit. This is about a man who loses everything except his thirst for revenge. Tom Hardy does an outstanding job, and Leo definitely deserved the Oscar. I don't think that I'll ever find something this beautiful ever again. If you haven't seen it, I couldn't recommend it enough.A true work of art This movie was literally tailor made for me. The opening quote about keep breathing and don't give up resonates with me so much. My favorite theme to movies. Then the beautiful all natural lighting at the beginning when they shoot the moose. I absolutely love nature movies. Then we get to see Tom Hardy start complaining about the gunshot and see the primal nature of the fur traders. Being from Oklahoma, and remembering football camp, that's exactly like what a bunch of guys act like without women haha. As they're giving bridger crap, I could totally relate. I'm thinking they totally got this right, then the arrow goes through the dudes neck. Then the attack at the beginning. I absolutely love extended scenes. I love the gore. I love the realisticness of the battle. There wasn't any choreographed long sword fight. Glass swings his rifle and misses, next thing you know he's being choked to death and just gets lucky that someone saved him. literally the best opening a movie has ever had. I think it put such a positive attitude on the rest of the movie. When I walked out of the theater, I already knew it was my favorite movie of all time. I've watched it three times by myself in the theater, it's that good. And each time I understand Tom Hardy's accent better. Also I thought Tom Hardy stole the show and if anyone deserves an Oscar, it's him.A flawed masterpiece Just saw the movie today without much expectations except for the fact that i knew that it was a movie directed by Alejandro and i just had to see it. And much less to my surprise, i was blown away. I remember watching his movie Biutiful(few years back) and i felt how much similar it was to Revenant in terms of the spiritual context and cinematic devices used in it. My favourite bits were those dream sequences and the quiet parts of the movie where Leo mostly had to rely on conveying emotions through eyes. Chivo did a work that is beyond fantastic,grandiose or anything superlative. I just feel blessed to have witnessed such a powerful cinema. Such visceral intensity left me in awe as i walked out of the hall. Voyeuristic pleasure at best. BTW what would you make of that falling star? Recurring motif since Birdman(i could be wrong though)? How is it related to this movie? Also the lingering breaths of Leo juxtaposed to different set of imagery, particularly the one that pans into the vast expanse of the clouds(somewhere in the middle of the movie)? I hear Mallick referenced a lot, and I can definitely see it. It has the same poetic sensibility, but it also delivers the survival movie goods without being too sentimental about nature. The dream sequences, voiceovers, and incredible cinematography that sort of lets the natural beauty take over and tell the story. I also noticed the way the movie showed long processes (like cutting open the horse or building shelters) would portray the actor doing everything in a series of short clips. Very 'Mallickian.' I haven't been so cold in the theater since "The Grey". It really tapped into something primal. This is also a somewhat refreshing movie considering the homogenized sterile landscape that America has become these last few decades. It's good to remember the fragility of civility. Edit: Tom Hardy was believable and had eyes that matched the relentless indifference of the terrain. Also, Leo really gave his body to the role, floating down cold rivers, crawling through freezing mud, maintaining the nuance of the role, but not distractedly so. He definitely deserves the Oscar.Awesome revenge by Glass..... The complete package for the movie lover. the movie is not for Valentines day but a worth watching if you want to see ultimate performances and incredible story...... More over it contains thrill horror and suspense.. All Over good work done by every member of the Team. Its also better to watch at big screen. Doesn't have much story but written good and efficient. Totally Oscar deserved acting by Leonardo DiCaprio. The Location is also very intimidating The best scene was when DiCaprio gets up from the grave. More over the movie was Capriolistic ... Totally satisfied with the movie and a really deserved Oscar #ThankyouDiCaprio.Yet another brilliant performance by DiCaprio!! Movie of the year!!! I don't usually write review's, bt i couldn't resist from doing so. As everyone already know DiCaprio is an exceptional actor of the century. However this movie n his acting was beyond excellence. The execution was mind blowing and the way the character was depicted was simply unbelievable. Mind you, this movie isn't meant for the weak as some scenes are really gory. I decided to take a look on the bts,n i was astounded to know he actually did eat all those disgusting raw meats on sets.. (that's not a joke)n sleeping is a horse carcass.. (who on earth can even think of doing something like that in real life, let alone for movies)..But yes, DiCaprio certainly did the impossible.I've always been a fan of true story,though some stories are altered by movie makers to give it a boost!! All I can say, he deserves all the awards on earth for this movie..Bravo!!!its a must must watch for movie goers.Zero for originality OK..... where to start.... If you know nothing about movies and have no prior history of film history, then you'll think this is an awesome, gripping and original movie.... But.... if you've seen Jeremiah Johnson, A Man Called Horse, Dances with Wolves, .... and can place them in context/their time you can cleary see this script is a total ripoff of those movies (eventhough it seems to be based on a book) and only has the great camera-work going for it. Those other movies were groundbreaking and had phenomenal actors. This one is not, but young moviegoers will probably be fooled. DiCaprio really tries to prove himself as a great actor in this movie, I'll give him that.... but he fails miserably.... proving he doesn't come close to the likes of Robert Redford, Newman, Brando,.... not by a long shot... Christian Bale might have kicked ass in this role though.... And the worst of all, I kid you not, without giving a spoiler away, there's an entire scene that comes straight from The Empire Strikes Back!!!!! Watch the movie and you'll see, it's so obvious..... At least they should have made some "Thanks to" or "Inspired by viewing".... acknowledgments... Sorry, but no thanks. the movie as such was certainly not bad if you don't take the above into account, but doesn't stand by its own at all and is just a mix of great (old) movies ripped off without giving them the merrit they deserve. No thanks.....  On the bright side, Domhnall Gleeson and Tom Hardy were excellent.Don't waste your life on this. This film ranks as one of the very worst films I've ever seen, It's down there with Birdman, Blair Witch and the that piece of tripe about Eva Peron with Madonna in it. I've walked out of films better than all of the above.... seriously folks, don't waste your lives on this unmitigated garbage. I thought the Bear was brilliant, the snow was pretty etc. The dialogue seemed to be predominately unintelligible mumbling (no I'm not deaf or hard of hearing), continuity was rubbish too, i.e. beard growth, ability to light fires, immunity from the effects of cold. , all in all I couldn't 'Bear' it, I think the beast was trying to do us all a favour by attempting to kill the main character, Just my opinion of course, no offense meant.Excessively violent, and yet manages to be boring This film tells the story of a man in the 1820's, who sets out with a group of men for a fur trading expedition. He is attacked by a bear, then left for dead by his men. After he witnessed his son being killed, he sets on a long journey to live for revenge. There is so much buzz around "The Revenant" so I had high hopes for it. However, I was thoroughly disappointed after just ten minutes. It is excessively violent and graphically gory. I think there is no need for ten minutes of fighting and five minutes of bear attack, when one minute each is already enough to convey the message. Most scenes drag on and on, what could have been told in ten seconds are often dragged to minutes long. Another thing that I dislike is the fact that all actors have long unkempt hair, covering most of their faces. This makes character recognition an intense mental challenge! Thirdly, the story is not engaging or interesting. It only involves Leonardo walking around in snow most of the time. There is nothing to captivate me. I watched the whole 2.5 hours of "The Revenant", and I was thoroughly bored.It's sooo depressing Don't listen to what anyone says about this movie. It's bad... I liked all the actors playing in this movie, I'm a real fan of all leonardo dicaprio's movies. I loved Tom Hardy In "peaky blinders". And I like the performance of Will poulter in "we are the millers" and "maze runner". Like always they didn't disappoint.  On the other hand this movie is depressing aaaalll the way. I don't say every movie should have a happy ending. But at least give us a reason to watch this movie besides beautiful panorama shots of the environment. The build up to action is to slow and when the action finally comes it's banal. No captain would go after a deserter alone with a wounded man!  Without spoiling any further about the movie. I thought it sucked really bad and I want the world to know about it! yours sincerely a moviefanat who made an account on IMDb just to trash this movie.They forgot the script Absolute highlight was the pictures of beautiful landscapes.  As for the film, i don't understand how anyone can be nominated for an Oscar if they don't have a script. Crawling around on the floor should not be enough for any award. I can only assume somebody noticed DiCaprio should really have had an Oscar by now so decided to give him one for this - speechless. Massive dose of Hollywood fantasy as surviving being killed by a hungry bear, floating half an hour in freezing water and not being shot by one of fifty Indians while shooting a self loading flintlock pistol back at them just about sums up the film.  No story, no words, no good. Save your money and your time and don't believe the hype!Time lost Really now, beside the landscape and the performance of Tom Hardy, everything else was boring. I do not understand why and how this movie was selected for so many Oscar nominations. The story is more than predictable, Caprio acting is limited as his character has its limitation (I do not want to write spoilers), the rest of the team, beside Tom Hardy which in my opinion was great, are below average. I consider this movie the best candidate for Rotten Tomatoes, not at all for the Oscar statue. Even if Caprio made some sacrifices in order to perform (temperatures, eating, etc.), I do not consider that the Oscar nominations should be awarded for such reasons. This movie was equal to boring time for me.Poor boring remake not worthy of time or praise. I saw this same movie when I was a kid early 70's I think it was dark boring and I fell asleep I remember it had a boat that some idiots were dragging around the wilderness..... This one is worse. At 2-1/2 hours long and you could have cut at least an hour out of it and not miss a thing. Some scenes went on and on. One of the worst directed films I have ever seen. The acting was fair Leo DiCaprio did a lot of grunting and talking in pawnee but certainly nothing Oscar worthy. He has done far better acting in past productions. The over all tone of the film was dark drab and dreary, but well filmed visually, so I will give a nod to the D.P. The whole film took place in the winter with snow on the ground and some streams were frozen. When Leo fell into the river and outran hostile Indians by floating down stream, it all fell apart. He had to have been in the a 34-40 degree river for 20-30 minutes and then crawled onto the bank and with night coming and he survived....The night...in wet cloths.....NOT POSSIBLE !!! He would have been dead in about 15 min. of hypothermia. Even if he was wearing wool clothes a wool blanked and a grizzly bear hide he would have froze. It got worse from there Hugh Glass's story is well known and documented. he did hunt down both men that left him there but forgave both men he did not kill them Over all the whole movie was poorly done......TLDR for Revenant, spoiler free If you wanted to watch heavy breathing for 2h and 36mins you got your movie over here. ended up watching clock after every 10mins because i got bored during first 40mins of the movie... probably ruined my enjoyment by watching the trailer as that was 80% of the good parts from the movie. Too long wouldn't watch again. I Would suggest it to people who like to watch this year new heavy breathing simulator though if you came here for action you are in wrong spot. Most of the dialogue is missing as well due to the heavy breathing. I Have seen many other movies where Di Caprio was perfoming but this one... I Still don't get it why people would suggest to give this movie a Oscar. Anyways i hope you people who didn't come here to watch Heavy Breathing Simulator 2016 i suggest to move along somewhere else.the worst ever it's absolutely wasting for money and 2.5 hours from my life.. the film is boring and one of the worst films in the history. the film starts with a good battle for few minutes after that there is nothing to watch until the bear attacked Leonardo DiCaprio. after this the rest is absolutely wasting of time. after about 1 hour the attendance at the cinema started to leave and my friends started to argue about it and 2 of them slept. the performance of Leonardo was amazing and the story too but it doesn't worth more that 1 hour. the length of the film made it boring and bad. All in all I am not recommending to watch this movie. it's better to wast your time sleeping or doing nothing instead of watching this.Totally unbelievable The cinematography is excellent but the story is so unbelievable that it snaps you out of the movie. The bear mauling if brutal then to be left for dead no food and bleeding? Gun powder in your throat to cauterize the wound? Body surfing down a river after all that in winter which a healthy person could last about 10 min before hypothermia would set in? Its not one thing, its not three things its the whole movie that is one thing after another that anyone older than 6 would say this is total Bull crap. You have to watch the movie to know that someone had no idea what the hell it was like in the cold trying to survive healthy not to mention half dead no food and Indians tracking you. I believe Indiana Jones is more believable jumping out of planes with rubber rafts. If you want a movie that just to kill time this will work, but don't get the idea its going to be some great look on how things were. Its an upscale B movie.Horrible, awful, boring, "movie" *warning may contain spoilers* I really do not understand the good reviews. I had to stop 3 quarters into this joke of a movie. No story. Bunch of killings. The star character (Dicaprio) has more souls than a cat. He gets mauled by a bear yet can walk, talk, and survive. He survives with drenched clothes in the freezing wilderness. He Flys off a cliff, and you guessed it, still lives.  I love Leo, and no words can describe my utter disappointment. The story is non existent, only killing and killing and killing. One native American looking for his daughter, one white man looking for revenge maybe? Or just trying to survive, and another white crook who killed his son.  Spare yourself, unless nice shots and graphics is all you care about !Violence-glorifying, utterly disgusting film And when you think that America has no other problems, they actually produce such a violence-glorifying, gory and disgusting film and promote it as a good, 12 Oscars deserving production. Should get 12 Raspberries instead.  . Worst motion picture ever produced . Worst performance Worst English actor with unintelligible accent uttering . Worst script . Worst directing . Worst everything (I can't even be bothered to look up what the nominations are for) I wonder who slept with whom and how often to get all these Oscar nominations.  From start to finish there is no intelligent plot whatsoever. It is the same old "You did me wrong and I will get my revenge" theme. That little bit stunning nature they let you see is not making up for the utter ugliness of this film. DiCaprio robbing through the woods, bleeding, moaning and groaning, surviving in situations that not even Superman would survive. Seriously - that is all Hollywood can do? The only one deserving of an Oscar would have been the bear, if he would just have finished off Hugh Glass within the first 30 min of the film and would therefore reduced my suffering by 120 min. P.S. Charlotte Rampling, I think you got it all wrong, I bet there are at least 20 black actors (in maybe mediocre productions) who would have been more deserving of a nomination (and winning).Boring and Pretentious...Banality and Mediocrity in abundance I truly hoped to finally enjoy a decent outing at the movies. I haven't seen a decent flick at the cinema in over a year. 2015 was very painful for a fan of the silver screen with such duds as Black Mass, Crimson Peak and Sicario all previewed with that ol' Miramax feel, a brand of underground hits from the 1990's which featured great casts and crew. I also was duped into the Hollywood hype-train flicks like Ant Man, Jurassic World and The Martian... Lord knows I was finally going to get a decent flick here with Leo and Hardy, even though Inarritu's Birdman was pure garbage, IMO. Unfortunately, this ain't happening, not today. Without spoiling anything vital to the story. I will say that you will see an exact copy of the early scene in Saving Private Ryan at the beaches of Normandy, only this time it will feature cowboys (fur traders) vs Indians. You will see Leo saved from brutally cold weather in the belly of a Tauntaun like in The Empire Strikes Back, I'm sorry I meant Luke saved in the belly of a horse!? I will also say that you will see Tom Hardy do a completely outstanding job of emulating the Tom Berenger role in Platoon, however, in this flick he will be rolling around in the snow and the scar will be worn on his scalp, not on his face. Kudos to Hardy cause he really sounded like Sgt. Barnes. Hardy enjoying a smoke off a pipe really sealed the deal for me. I will also say that this script has the same revenge motif used several times before, primarily in Braveheart and Gladiator. The end result is a ton of wasted scenes featuring snowy mountains, snowy trees and snowy rivers, all of which seemed like they were stolen from, or at the very least, inspired by Godfrey Reggio. Needless to say, I could easily see Leo signing on to this Inarritu project after the Birdman hype because, Hey! if he could get Michael Keaton a best actor award... Bottom line, a bunch of pretentious garbage by Hollywood and their new favorite hack director.Don't waste your time with this atrocity An impressive synthesis of even poorer audio quality than Brokeback Mountain; considerably duller than Dances With Wolves-and contains about as much high class cinematography as a gratuitous wet fart on the set of the Blair Witch Project. However if you enjoy Leonardo grappling around dressed in the pelt of a bear in the wilderness along with listening to Tom Hardy's incomprehensible slurs for well over two hours- then this film is for you. If, however you prefer something which has more substance, a well articulated and interesting plot and acting that is worthy of an Oscar, I would perhaps avoid this film more so than the bubonic plague. I found the whole film to be utterly painful to watch, needlessly long and an unfortunate and irredeemable waste of time. Watch Star Wars instead for goodness sake.A shitty film. (Not a hater like most people here) I don't like this film Man,seriously. The film has no point. It is well directed film with well made scenes but there is not content behind it. The most important thing in a film it is his script and the film has no actual script. Looks like the script for the film and all the effort behind the film all made to make it the most "breathtaking" cinematic it could be and the result is a film Without an actual plot behind it and that goes nowhere. To sum up a shitty film. Enjoy. I need more words so i'll just repeat that word.Enjoy.Enjoy.Enjoy.Enjoy.Enjoy.Enjoy.Enjo y.Enjoy.Enjoy.Enjoy.Enjoy.Enjoy.Enjoy.Enjoy.what the academy's saw? one of the most boring films ever The cinema has given us lessons on how to make boring movies, like Titanic, Gravity and now Revenant, But Iñarritu seems to dominate how kill a story in an ocean of boredom. The photography is not bad, but wasn't the best,a photography without interesting perspectives, without interesting lighting, they didn't play with shadows, nothing interesting is a picture that you see in any documentary about nature with low budget, several documentaries achieve better images and they are not nominated to Oscars. It remains in doubt the veracity that the academy has, to reward movies that don't deserve be projected, as it was this. The plot is predictable, repetitive and did not bring anything new to the industry, the performance is regrettable, If you have sleep problems this could be the cure, you will fall sleep several times. was more landscaper film than a survival story. Don't waste your life time, life is to short to waste your time on earth watching this film.How do I wash this movie out of my brain? There is almost nothing good to say about this film. It was painful to watch, slow, no joy or any good feelings, and just plain boring after a while. I cannot understand why it got so many awards. Even the nature scenes which were beautiful were impossible to enjoy because of the feeling of dread hanging over every scene. The last hour was predictable. I dreaded what was to come, holding out hope that it would not be a long drawn out ending to an exhausting film. Unfortunately, the pain was drawn out. Like a bad dream that would not end. It is worse than a waste of my money, it ruined my evening and will make me feel awful for days. Avoid this film.Brilliant Directing Made a Bad Script Bearable Spoilers Galore, consider yourself warned! When I saw Birdman, also written and directed by Inarritu, I thought it was great. It was a stylish and interesting movie experience. However, I was left feeling something was missing, which prevented it from entering "favorite" status, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was. After seeing the Revenant, I realized what Inarritu lacks. His direction, while skillful, is cold. Emotion, which in Birdman isn't needed to carry the script, is missing here and it hurts the story. First, the movie could have been edited down by a half to a full hour. The scenery is beautiful but does every shot need to linger so long? The story is about revenge and survival. However, I found the whole script to be dull and lacking. The conversations are bland and if not for Inarritu's skill as a director, the movie would be unwatchable, unbearable even. Hugh Glass, DiCaprio, is the main character and the guide to a fur trapping expedition. His Native American wife was murdered years before and he was left alone to care for their son. His son, now a teenager, is on the fur expedition with him. The expedition is lead by Captain Henry, Gleeson, and the villain John, Hardy, is also a member of the party. John opposes almost all of Glass's decisions at every turn. When we meet the expedition, they are quickly descended upon by a group of Native Americans. The scene is brutal but well directed The struggle to survive is well captured but the scene goes on a bit long. We later learn the Native Americans are looking for the Chief's daughter, Powaqa, who has been kidnapped. My issue is the Native Americans just start shooting with no questions asked at all "English" men because the French, who actually have the girl, told them that's who took her. They aren't even worried that she might be accidentally killed in the fray. I get it, Inarritu wants this world to be as merciless as possible but sometimes it went beyond reason.  Some of the members of the expedition manage to survive the attack. Glass comes up with a new path to avoid another attack and return to their fort. But, Glass is viciously attacked by a bear in one of the most skillfully directed scenes possibly ever. Glass 's condition is dire but he clings to life. As they continue on their difficult return course, it becomes apparent they won't be able to carry the injured Glass up the mountain. At first, the leader, Captain Henry, debates putting Glass out of his misery. In an unforgiving land, Capt. Henry is more sentimental and takes a more noble path and offers money to those willing to stay with Glass until he passes. John, Bridger - a nice young man - and Glass's son, Hawk, stay. John has always felt that they should euthanize Glass. So, when the two young men are gone, he offers Glass a mercy death. Glass eventually agrees. Hawk comes upon John while he is doing the deed and freaks out. In the scuffle, John kills Hawk as Glass lays helpless watching. You already dislike John but there really isn't enough character development for you to feel completely devastated by Hawk's death.... and that's a major problem in a revenge story. Plus, it took an hour to get to this point - an hour to establish the setup and it still lacked the necessary emotional punch. By the time any chance of revenge comes, you feel just as worn out as Glass and it doesn't really matter any more - which in some ways was the point of the movie even if it failed to fully realize that.. Moving on. John makes it back to the fort with Bridger who is ignorant to everything. And, for the next hour or more, we watch Glass miraculously survive through some impossible situations like falling off a cliff. Glass meets another man whose family has also been killed but he decided to leave revenge in God's hands. Finally, Glass is found by the those at the Fort. At this point, you're not sure who has been more tortured, Glass or you, the viewer. When they return, John has taken all of the money from the safe, we don't know how he managed this, and ran off. Here comes some unbelievable aspects, Glass and Henry decide to go after John alone. Two men, that's it? This is to setup 2 aspects of the forced ending: 1) Glass can pretend to be dead on the horse for a cool scene. 2) Glass can let go of his revenge. Except, after a lengthy savage duel, Glass has his chance to fulfill his revenge but his companion's words echo in his head to leave it to God. So, he does by letting him drift down the river... which would be a good ending if that left John with Glass's fate – injured and lost in the wilderness with nothing but it's not. Glass had previously saved Powaqa and those same Native Americans are coincidentally 60 feet down river. John floats to them and they kill him. Is that really leaving it to God's hands? Or letting someone else do the dirty deed as you watch? How about more simply, Captain Henry gathers a group of men to catch John, he has to abandon his belongings including the money to run away. As they risk more perils, Glass sees the futility and talks Capt. Henry into standing down, to leave it to God. Other notes, Hardy is a good actor but here he sounded like he had a huge wad of cotton stuck in his mouth . Inarritu deserved the best directing Oscar despite how bad the movie was. Lastly, there a bunch of dream sequences that involved Glass's wife that I felt added little to the story. DiCaprio's Oscar is well deserved.Brutal, boring and pointless This is, simply put, one of the most sadistic films I've ever seen. I read the novel, "Lord Grizzly," by Frederick Manfred, when I was in high school. It told the story of Hugh Glass and it was a good novel. Years later, Richard Harris starred in "Man in the Wilderness," also based on the Hugh Glass story. It wasn't a great movie, but it wasn't bad. "The Revenant" is a terrible movie. It's extremely violent at the beginning; extremely boring in the middle; and extremely brutal at the end.  George Lucas has said the secret to making a great movie is: Have a great opening, a great ending and try not to screw up the middle. The director of "The Revenant" failed on all three counts.  This is why I don't pay any attention to Academy Award nominations any more.If you like a movie that can put you to sleep watch this movie. This movie is only good for the scenery. If you want two and a half hours of scenery and seeing a man grunting and crawling, you should watch this movie. If you value your time and want to watch something worth watching in your two and a half hours avoid this movie. After one and a half hours the same person is still crawling and groaning and breathing heavy. I edited it as so many scenes take so much time and there is nothing but scenery. Then you get back to groaning and crawling. This movie should have been a 45 minute movie but it is a painstaking two and a half hours. Go to the last 30 minutes after the first 30 minutes and maybe it is a redeemable movie. This movie is so boring that an insomniac will fall asleep with all of the groaning and snoozing and grunts. I could easily edit this movie to 30 minutes and nothing would be lost and at 30 minutes it would be interesting. I must give this the worst movie of the year award and it should have gone straight to CD not even DVD. I can't understand how many people like this movie. The story is better than movie and takes much less time to read.Disappointing Yawner Immediately forgettable, because no emotional connection is established between the characters and audience. As you are watching, you find yourself asking "Why isn't this working?" and, as you walk out of the theater, you're still wondering "Why?" One answer is the characters are single dimensional; another, the editing is confused, chopped. A third, scenes of nature, the outdoors, environment, locale, etc that should be integral to the emotions, but are not evocative, and seem to have been filmed, then interspersed periodically for no reason and to little effect. David Lean could use the locale to tell the story. This director cannot or does not. Im sorry to say these things, because I was really looking forward to the movie.The most disappointing movie ever. Why: I have never seen Leonardo DiCaprio in any below-the-average movie so I had high expectations watching it. What a shock! The most boring movie I can remember having watched. How can it have 8,2 rating with so many negative reviews? It should have been between 4,5 and 5,5 stars without any doubts.How can people be excited about it? Seriously, I have never written any reviews ever before all these years I have this account in IMDb but l just couldn't stand it. I had to say it and warn others. It was that disappointing. Boring plot, scenario inexistent, too much violence and that ridiculous scene with the bear... all mixed with a direction the cherry on the top of the cake. A direction that could even make someone who just got an ecstasy pill to fall asleep after few minutes.  Don't waste your money like most people say here.Worst acting and directing I've seen in quite a while I cannot fathom how this awful movie won awards! Leonardo DiCaprio did his worst acting ever; the directing was horrid; and the scenery was dark and undefined throughout. Many parts were slow and drawn out to show ugly gray or white scenery or for reasons I could not ascertain. Tom Hardy said that God was a squirrel. The camera remained on him for about 30 seconds, as if he'd said something profound. A very obvious mistake the director made throughout was overlooking Leonardo's well manicured nails. He is in the wild for days/weeks. His beard grows, hair grows, lips get all nasty looking, yet those nails remain perfectly manicured. Okay, now imagine you are freezing and left to die in a grave with a little dirt thrown on you. What would you do first? Yes! You would try to find your son, but then you would build a fire! Instead, they show Leonardo throwing on his furs and marching off into the woods. All Leonardo did in the movie was grunt,groan, and make the same faces over and over. He had very few lines to say. However, when he should have absolutely screamed his lungs out, he made not even a grimace. That was when he was getting into the freezing water to keep from being seen by the Indians. With open cuts and freezing water, he should have had a huge facial and physical reaction, even if he didn't want them to hear him scream in pain. From there, this director has him seen floating along in the icy river longer than a human can survive without drowning from hypothermia. When Leonardo finally gets out of the water, he is not even shivering. My husband caught a part where Leonardo shot twice without reloading. I mean, was this director smoking crack the whole time this was being filmed?! And he and Leonardo got awards! It floors me. This movie didn't even make enough money to cover its budget! All this money and time spent on a movie and it is pitiful. A great movie about a sniper can't get an award, but they award this trash?! The actor Tom Hardy is the one who did the best acting. HE should have gotten the best actor award! Some of the other actors were good also. I will never go to another movie directed by this incompetent director. Elitests in Hollywood gave him an award, the film an award, and Leonardo an award. I'm the movie goer. Therefore, my decision is what counts. Only Tom Hardy would have received an award from me. If I could, I would take all 3 awards and give them to the sniper movie by Clint Eastwood, which was shamelessly blackballed by those same Hollywood elitists.Just awful I HATED this movie... There aren't very many movies I can say that about either. I couldn't understand a single word the southerners were saying.. They had subtitles for all the other languages, I feel like I needed it for English as well. That's not even the worst part about it.. Everything was so random and just one thing after another, nothing seemed to make sense! For some reason I have to give 10 lines, but try not to give anything away.. I hate how movies, this one as well, glorify rape. I hate how they show animals getting shot point blank. This guy gets shot, he lives, he gets mauled by a bear, lives, gets buried alive, lives, goes over a waterfall, lives.. I finally walked out after the rape scene and wish I could get my money and time back. It's 2.5 hours of worthless trash.
Overrated movie lacking direction This movie was built up by the trailers and I was actually excited to see it. The fact of the matter is that this movie is boring and not worth seeing. How major movie critics almost unanimously gave this movie positive reviews really makes no sense. Googling reviews for this movie proves to be much more telling than the scores it received on "reputable" websites. The scores are overblown because people were being generous with negative scores and way too generous with positive reviews by giving perfect scores to this mess of a movie. If you want to watch a movie and feel really uncomfortable this is for you. The emotions are forced at the viewer and explained by a plot that falls apart like the memories in the movie. Unfortunately my memory of this movie will remain.I feel like everybody has missed the point I am not normally one to write reviews, but I couldn't help reading several for this film on this site that just did't seem to understand where I think the film was supposed to be coming from. The majority of the complaints I saw were that the film was 'too depressing for a children's film', but whilst I see where they are coming from in some regards, every child who I have seen watch this film (I work in a cinema) has absolutely loved it, and laughed out loud almost constantly. They are not old enough to realise the message the film is trying to convey: that life isn't all about happiness. I applaud the attempt from Pixar to make a film that is not only hilarious in places, but is also a major comment on what life is like to be a younger teenager, transitioning through one of the most important moments of life.  From a more personal perspective, why should everything we show our children gloss over the reality of life, and try to make them believe everything is rosy 24/7? Again, what this film does brilliantly through the message I took away at the end was that life will never be 100% full of happiness, but that is fine. Why does it have to be? A little bit of sadness is necessary. If a person was never sad, they would be inhumane.  Overall then, I suppose my review is more of a comment on the type of film we exhibit to children, and how the Nanny-state we live in looks to protect them from most of lives inevitabilities. Either way, what can't be ignored is that this film is equal parts sad, and equal parts what I am sure will become a timeless classic in years to come.One of the worst and boring Disney films period! I have not seen every Disney Pixar film. The ones I have watched are the Toy Story films, Monsters Inc and it's sequel Monster University, a Bugs Life, Cars, Finding Nemo &amp; The Incredibles. The ones I have not seen are Wall-e, Ratouttlie, Brave, Cars 2 and The Good Dinosaur. Most of the ones I seen were either great or not bad. My favourite Disney film is the Lion King followed by the Jungle Book (1967) and Pinocchio. But this film is one of the worst and boring Disney films I have ever seen! The film is about a little girl named Riley who moves to a new home in San Franscisco after her dad gets a new job and her mind is controlled by a group of creatures known as 'emotions' who get her through everyday life but two of them Joy and Sadness end up in the bowls of Riley's mind where old memories are stored and without them especially Joy Riley's life is misery at home and school. This film was just awful. This film may be family friendly but the film is nothing like a film for children. There is very little comedy and is more adult-themed than the other Pixar films. It is my opinion also that this film shares similarities to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Exorcist and The Land Before Time. Like in Snow White the emotions have names matching that of their personality. For example Joy is all happy and optimistic while Sadness is like Eeyore by being downright miserable. Like Regan McNeil of The Exorcist Riley is processed in her mind but by the emotions and not a demon named Pazuzu while her parents and presumably everyone in the film are also processed by emotions. The film's sub plot where Joy and Sadness try to get back to headquarters is a throwback to the Land Before Time where Littlefoot and his friends try to find the Great Valley.  I also felt the film was rushed and none of the characters apart from Riley, Joy and Sadness get much screen time. Even Anger, Fear and Disgust hardly get involved in the film. Disgust arguably was the emotion who got demoted to extra. The film was as I said rubbish and how people loved this film has left me stumped. To me this film does not deserve a sequel as this film is just not good enough for one.Over Simplified I get that this is a kids film &amp; they were trying to use simple ways of showing how emotions are formed but I can't forgive the fact that the whole plot was about how a little girl was suffering from depression because, due to a clerical error, happiness was out of office. &amp; the final lesson just felt like "Cry &amp; everything will be alright".  Given how much praise this film was receiving (let alone it's a Pixar film) I was hoping for a much smarter explanation of emotions. Also most other aspects of the film just weren't funny/enjoyable.Worst one ever The film was awful and extremely boring. It was just so depressing and sadness was possibly the most annoying character ever conceived...why why why did she have to keep touching things after she was told over and over not to, just irritating. It got to the point where I was dreading the character coming on the telly. Animated Disney/pixar films should stick to what they are good at and that's making children (and adults) happy. Yes they can have a moral lesson and sad bits but the general overtone is happiness not depressing characters inside another depressing character that I couldn't care less about. Should never have been made, should have saved their money. Im very sad that I can never get back the time I wasted on it...I could have watched paint dry.Very boring for a children's movie I had high hopes of Inside Out before heading to the movie theater to go see it. The movie had lots of promotion on TV and Disney Channel where kids mainly go to see the exciting movies coming to a theatre near them. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed in this movie.  I have to admit that the idea of the story was great and very creative, especially to young children. Other than that, the lack of character development and no good plot development ruined the entire film for me. Almost the entire movie consists of Joy and Sadness walking around that large area of Riley's memories, attempting to find their way back to headquarters, while the other emotions nonchalantly mess everything up (I don't get why Joy was the only emotion with some commonsense). Of course, along the way, they met a spunky elephant (mixed with some other animals) who managed to make situations worse more than making them better, and of course, he had to die at the end because, reality check, it's a Disney film. And their goal is to somehow make you cry one way or another. I just didn't get how the elephant disappeared so quickly, considering he hadn't been down the forgotten memory abyss that long. If the memories died so quickly like he had, why were their thousands of old grey memories still intact?  Anyway, that's only a small screw-up compared to the rest of the movie. I felt like I had been constantly waiting for more character development for Riley but once again, I was let down. The entire movie revolved more around the emotions more than Riley, who from the trailer, seemed to be the star of the show. I could go on and on about the huge flaws and plot holes but I only have a limit of a thousand words. Do yourself a favor and spare the $7.50 and wasted hour that you'll never get back. I wouldn't watch that movie again if my life depended on it.Inside out worst pixar movie talk about lack luster in this movie and lack of joy , i had to endure watching this movie which had an awful plot , about some little girl with emotional center something goes screwy and she gets depressed and almost leaves home only to learn crying is good at the end . like how does that appeal to everyone ? talk about boring .The animated design for the characters was good but seriously pixar get your stuff together you had so many classic movies that would make this look like a piece of crap e.g wall-e , Up , incredible , monster inc, monsters university , brave, toy story1-3, ratatouille etc . Please bring those kinds of movies with great plot and fire the writers and director who wrote this movie . they should never set foot in the pixar company EVER!!Inside Out a Depressed Disney I went to see this with my 6 year old and 12 year old and we all left depressed and hating the movie. Disney needs to remember they are in the "entertainment" business. This is the second movie they have made lately that leaves you feeling worse after you saw it than you were before viewing it. Inside Out begins with a good story line, but sadness (better named depression)is the biggest part of the movie. Yes, there is realism. But, I prefer the "fantasy" part of cartoons where one can escape the bad and enjoy a light-hearted laugh for a bit. In my opinion, Disney head's need to see a professional about this depression they feel so compelled to share. I won't waste my money on another movie ticket to a Disney show until can see people laughing when they talk about the new show. I grew up with Disney movies and loved almost all of them. Am so sad that my kids can't have that same joy! This movie was such a waste of talent and time!!! Save your money and watch a DVD at home instead.Pixar, how far you have fallen...because this movie was terrible. Really. There are a few reasons why I consider this movie terrible and why I find it so horrifying that it's current rating is 8.5 when Spirited Away--one of the best animated movies ever created--is sitting at 8.6. Long story short, the characters were for the most part difficult to like. Joy was thoughtlessly cruel and condescending to Sadness and the other emotions, and Riley--the girl we're all supposed to love and find easy to relate to--was extremely obnoxious/egocentric and rubbed me the wrong way for the entire movie. I resented the stereotypes that were used and found them more than a little insulting. For example, Riley has an "imaginary boyfriend" at the age of 12. I don't know about you people, but I find this extremely concerning. 12 year old girls should NOT be thinking that they should have boyfriends at their age--while it may start out innocent, it can unconsciously encourage premature sexual thoughts and activity, which is EXTREMELY unhealthy and dangerous at their age. Also, I don't personally know any girls (including myself) who ACTUALLY had imaginary boyfriends. Ever. Let alone at 12! And don't even get me started on the imaginary friend Bing-Bong. BING-BONG! That's actually his name! I found him irritating and, frankly, disturbing. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm sure young children will LOVE this movie, and maybe some parents and teenagers as well. However, on the whole, I would NOT consider it up to par with other Disney Pixar movies. It was compared to "UP" for Pete's sake--the movie that had EVERYONE crying within the first 10 minutes! It was an enormous let- down for me, especially since all the raving had really caused me to build it up, which made it all the more disappointing. Therefore, watch at your own peril. Consider yourself warned.Meet the Little Voices Telling You to Leave the Theater I am genuinely confused as to why people are calling this "Pixar's Best" or an original concept. Pixar has done far better than this and even the mediocre 'Brave' and 'Cars' are far better. Not only is the concept of 'people controlling your brain' tired and used multiple times, they managed to make it even more boring. There is absolutely no nuance in this film. The characters, (joy, anger, fear, disgust, sadness), are a visual representation of their emotion. I mean seriously, do they understand subtlety at all? Anger literally catches on fire, sadness is blue, and joy looks like every boring same-faced cartoon princess. Not to mention none of the emotions look like Riley, the little girl. This is even more of a flaw when we later see the emotions in other characters heads, (Riley's parents, her teacher, etc.) who look just like the person whose brain they inhabit. Why would Riley be the only one whose emotions all look nothing like her? They took an old concept, made it incredibly literal, and then botched it up with inconsistencies.  Aside from the boring concept, this movie is way too complex and depressing for children. The plot is nearly nonexistent and the most constant thing throughout is joy and sadness attempting to get back to the control center of Riley's brain after being sucked out by accident. Other than that its all very dull and if it doesn't make you cry, you'll probably fall asleep. There are, from what I remember, no laugh out loud jokes. Way too much time went into world-building and showing off the various landscapes and rooms of Riley's mind for there to be any actual storyline. Everything felt extremely dragged out and joy and sadness ran into obstacle after obstacle trying to get back to the control center. Finally, Riley tries to run away and it just so happens that joy returns and fixes everything before she has the chance to get too far. Not only was it absurd for an 11 year old girl to try and take a bus back home, it was far too sad the way the whole thing was shown.  There were so many random characters introduced for 5 seconds which served no purpose other than to lighten the mood, and they failed at that too. Bing Bong the imaginary friend who was a furry pink elephant was out of place and his design was really uncreative. When he died, I honestly felt relieved not to hear his irritating voice any more. He had no personality or character development and therefore there wasn't any reason to feel sad when he died. Unles of course you're a little kid in which case the whole thing was way too heavy. Either way its a definite miss. And for those saying only psychology majors can enjoy this movie, that's not true. I can't imagine anyone honestly liking this movie. Aside from the complete inaccuracy of anyone feeling only one emotion at a time, everything about this movie was casually ableist. The portrayal of depression as being something small and easily gotten over was incorrect and terrible. Even the advertisements ("Meet the Little Voices Inside Your Head") felt like an insensitive joke towards people with schizophrenia or other disorders who have auditory hallucinations. Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Too depressing and confusing for kids, too boring and literal for adults, this movie is enjoyable by no one. Pixar did not please its intended audience, nor did it please the grown ups. The one redeeming factor was the animation, which was good but all the designs were so uncreative that good animation couldn't save it.Poor imagination and no fun turns the movie upside down. This still had some appeal as a trailer but sadly as a whole it felt flat pretty fast. The whole movie had a depressing effect and this became more obvious as the movie progressed. The basic story was some what ridiculous about only 5 characters controlling your brain similar to the factions in divergent(same screenplay writer perhaps?) Of the 5 characters 2 are highlighted and both of them (Joy and Sadness)are just annoying and the 3 side characters are totally forgettable. Problem here is they always react the same making it very predictable and there for equals boring. It has not been a good animation year, only the penguins worked and Minions and now this one really failed miserable. So,please ,put the fun and laughs back in these movies and stop with putting adult subjects in to kids movies. That might have worked once but at this point you're overdoing it. I think this one was rushed and not as well worked out as previous installments by pixar and I do hope they find they're way again and return to the classics we all know and love. Re-animate.Inside Out, Upside Down I have never entered in such a poor review for a Disney film. I am always defending the "Imagineers" and their creative processes. I'm a Floridian..not a true Florida cracker, more of a saltine (or maybe a Triscuit). But, my love for all things Disney ended with Inside Out.  The premise was really great, in concept, but extremely poorly enacted. So, yeah, OK, you've got your emotions, "Joy, Anger, Sadness, Disgust, etc...." Yeah, it's that bad. An etc. Do I really need to say more?  Well, of course, there's more. Riley is THE perfect girl. But really, what she is, is sheltered. A good family. Parents that worship her. A core group of friends and education, extracurricular activities, etc.  Yeah, another etc.  Societal norms and morés dictate that this is really not the case. Having both parents, let alone both parents being married, is an event these days. Sure, we'd all love to believe that those idyllic family structures still exist. But, truly, ask your children, it isn't even close.  So, let's go ahead and move this "perfect" family, because of Dad's job (yeah, cuz that's an original storyline) and plunk em down in Cali from Minnesota. Disney/Pixar's attempts to poke fun at Vegan lifestyles to get the viewer closer to the family is pretty weak. As is the whole system of forming and processing memories.  Leading us all to believe that joy is the most powerful and important emotion. When, in the end, sadness rules the roost. Ummmm, what?  All "core memories" are formed by sadness and touched by joy. Please.  The disconnect between the emotions and the girl is huge. Watching a movie that is supposed to be happening inside this girl is confusing. Riley's actions are so delayed that is clear that we're all watching minutes of dialogue before she reacts. It's distracting. Not to mention pretty lame.  It seems Disney/Pixar kinda realized this and decided to showcase Riley's emotions while she was asleep. Believable. Mmhhmm. Yeah, ummmm, no.  Throw in a couple of distracted parents and stress, not even real stress, a kind of implied stress, and they're you have the whole basis of the film. Pretty shaky.  I saw this film with an 11 and 12 year old. Both girls Riley's age. Now, granted, these girls have great families...but they also have mothers going through terminal illness and fathers that work their trails off to make ends meet. So their emotions run high. But they aren't cry prone girls. And yet, here we were, popcorn, candy, sodas for breakfast watching this horrible film. Both girls in tears and a very well placed f-bomb by yours truly to lighten the mood.  Bottom line? 90 minutes of confusing, sad, disjointed dialogue and about 5 minutes of happy. Never a laugh out loud. Maybe a smile. Maybe.  So, ummmm, what the hell Disney/Pixar? This the trend? If so, take me back to it being a small small world. It's way better than drilling these fake boyfriend thoughts of being our savior into our daughter's head. First were waiting for "our price to come." Now we're relying on fake boyfriends? Please.  How about a girl that can handle herself, her school, her family, and be strong? Not this lame nonsense.In a word, Lousy. Usually love Pixar, Toy Story for example, was easy and fun to follow up on the big screen but Inside Out is a jumble of fast talking characters, sudden bursts of sound that'll wake you up when you feel yourself drifting off. This movie is hard to follow, has a very sophisticated theme and so anyone under 10 probably won't sit through this one. For example there are about a 1/2 a dozen different characters that represent "feelings" ( anger, sadness, fear etc ) all talking at the same time in some instances. Then there are the complicated explanations of long term/short term memory, REM sleep cycles, I mean, If I were a 5 year old, I wouldn't know what was going on after about 10 mins, I'd be lost. Not to mention that there are long stretches of fast action accompanied by loud rather jarring music and shrill voices etc. It's a mess of a movie &amp; definitely not for the very young because they won't understand it, believe me.The Cheese Stands Alone I simply cannot comprehend why this movie is being heralded as Pixar's finest. It is flawed in so many ways, which is uncharacteristic of Pixar. The concept is wholly unoriginal, which lead me to believe that Pixar would present us with something astounding to compensate, but what they have given us is unimaginative human characters whose personified emotions represent exhausted stereotypes. When we meet the father's emotions, they're lazily watching sports instead of taking an active interest in family dinner time, while the mother's emotions try to resign themselves to the fact that they have settled for a schlub instead of a handsome ex lover. The daughter is presented as the perfect all-American girl and we are never given even a glimpse of her being anything but perfect until the emotions Joy and Sadness find themselves ejected from the control center of her mind. Then suddenly she's the clichéd brat that lazy story telling will have us believe of every tween and teenager. The most unbelievable action of this character comes when this seemingly ideal daughter decides that in order to be happy she should run away from her loving home and travel alone across the country. All the while, mom and dad take this in their stride as though she's always behaved this way. All this, we are shown, is because the only emotions running the show are anger, disgust and fear, since joy and sadness are still trying to return to the control center. By Pixar's logic, we are incapable of rational actions without joy and sadness. Okay, I get that it's a movie, but this is bad writing. At one point we are expected to accept Sadness's antics simply because she claims that she doesn't know why she's doing what she's doing. What!?! If the ones controlling the brain cannot account for their actions, then what is the point of the premise? Perhaps the sequel will show us the emotions inside the heads of the emotions sadness, joy and the rest. Aside from the terrible story line and lack of character depth, the film lacks the usual humor we have come to associate with Pixar, and while Joy and Sadness's quest to get back where they belong is undoubtedly frustrating for them, the constant obstacles they encounter make it almost unbearable to sit through. Mostly, I feel, because again and again they keep getting sooooo close, only to have something happen and they have to find another way, finally making it happen through the use of a stack of imaginary boyfriends. Let me say that again: They finally get back to control by stacking up a bunch of imaginary boyfriends. Yes, I know, it's a movie, and a cartoon at that, but this is Pixar. We have come to expect better. Well, I have, at least. Judging by the other reviews and the box office, Inside Out is a huge hit. I still cannot fathom why. I must be taking crazy pills.Tinkerbell with Pixar Animation I have been a Pixar fan since the Luxo Jr. days and watched their acquisition by Disney with trepidation. After seeing Inside Out, it appears that the Disneyfication of Pixar is now complete. This movie is just another one of those execrable Disney Tinkerbell movies with better actors and animation. It is so insipid that I wanted to leave within the first two minutes (ok, I actually wanted to leave during the horrible short that preceded it.) There was much laughter in the audience; all of it from children under the age of 6. Pixar movies always entertained people of all ages with their clever plots, excellent acting, and beautiful graphics. The animation of Inside Out was decent, the cast excellent, but I have nothing good to say about the rest. The plot was extremely derivative. There was absolutely no surprise about what was going to happen - once they set up the premise, it was obvious that we were doomed to another hour of their trying to get back, with mishaps along the way and the inevitable happy ending. It reminded me of the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 rock climbing episode (for those of you in the know). Even my teenager and her friend thought the movie and short were "babyish". I'm waiting until they make a princess sequel and have a ride named after it at Disneyland. Bye, bye Pixar. I'll miss you.inside out of your mind what a complete waste of time - read all the wonderful reviews that are misleading, obviously these are the people that go to Disneyland about 20 times a year - incredibly slow paced, especially after "JOY" &amp; "SADNESS" get sucked into another dimension where they befriend Bing Bong, Riley's imaginary friend. Wow - it took forever. Bing Bong is the films JAR JAR BINKS, just so annoying and irritating. This is a definite G rated film. I did not see any adult themes whatsoever. This movie makes Winnie The Pooh look like a horror film. This is for 12 year old girls. Parents are so delusional(thanks for the positive reviews Mom &amp; Dad)Misery on a stick OK, playtime's over Pixar, now get over it. This film is so plainly a prequel – c.f. references to a 'puberty' button on the new 'emote' console in the character Rileys brain - you will fail to find anything of entertaining value for your 100 minute investment. You may harbour fond memories of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille – all unique, funny, thrilling and entertaining. But, that is not what you will get with Inside Out. 'Joy', after all, is banished to long-term memory and can't get back in charge of the console. (Since when was a single emotion ever 'in charge' anyway?). Inside Out can be taken as a metaphor for the poor sops who work for the Disney Corporation. Yes, they started out with true optimism about the life journey they had chosen, (with Pixar). Then, all of a sudden they are 'taken over' by a less than friendly peer. To compound this, they are moved from their original 'playpen' to a new post industrial work lot. All is grim. Sadness takes hold and taints everything that is done. Even 'Joy' begins to sob with sadness and grief. Save us from this self-indulgent misery. Not only is it inappropriate as kiddie oriented movie fodder, those of us who are sentient, self-aware adults can do without this additional mock unhappiness. By the way, most human brains have a 'fat controller' who orchestrates proceedings keeping everything on an even keel – even if that is 'sadness' for a while. Riley's brain seems to be lobotomised – even before puberty has hit. Give this film a wide berth, in fact, it might be best if someone scuttles this ship before the pestilence it's carrying spreads.Very original but for what audience Well I went to see this movie last night with a friend and I think for children under 10 the movie is to complex. The main human emotions were very original but the movie never got me in. The story was also not that good. I would not take my daughter to the movie and it is that my friend liked it, otherwise I would not even have finished it. I think this is not what we are used to from Pixar. All the other Pixar movies were watchable for adults and children but to be honest I thought it was pretty awful. The beginning before the movie started made me already feel that it would not be good. I can see why some people like it but I think there should have been a better storyline.Needs Philosophical and Psychological discussion There is a problem with psychological reality with this movie. The fact that it is presented as entertainment for children is an extreme negative. One of the most important thrusts of human evolution has been to free humans from the former mental encumbrances of past centuries. In this Movie the child is depicted as controlled by a number of entities, the child is in fact insane but depicted as normal. I am concerned as to the sanity of the person(s) who wrote this script. Such a movie disserves the bonfire. I am amazed that our Psychologists are not protesting the showing of this movie which demonstrates only the origins of western psychology - the cocaine importer and addict Sigmund Freud.Mind = Blown Yes, my mind is blown away by this movie not because it's spectacular as it was hailed by many critics but because this movie is super lame for a studio that has never released a bad movie (edit: i have forgotten about brave and cars 2 i guess pixar has lost their touch and that's why they made finding dory) CGI wise this movie has an outstanding work like usual but the real problem is the story. The first 1 hour of the movie i was waiting for the main problem that would be the objective of the story but i was actually watching it this whole time and watching it through the end i just felt nothing and said "is that it? what the heck?".  The climax/ending was very weak it was somehow really flat probably because the main obstacle itself was rather stupid. The movie environment seemed very dull and narrow especially for the imaginary part of the mind. The special 5 mind characters are annoying and predictable. The jokes and dialogs are not memorable. I don't know what kind of drugs these good reviewers are using but this is the worst Disney PIXAR movie yet, it's so bad that i decided to write my first review for this abomination of an animation. I would give this 5/10, but with the misleading score such as 8.4, i feel there is an obligation to demote it down hence the 1/10. For those who thinks this is a hate/bandwagon/troll attempt. no this is solely what i feel about this movie and it's a shame that people are so against bad reviews. TL;DR: this movie lacks a fun.To find the sun again I'm like various reviewers who consider themselves Pixar fans. In fact, I'm an animated film fan and try to see the award winners whenever I can. The beautiful colors and well developed art of Pixar is most often worth the cost of admission to me. But Inside Out is so awful it drove me and my significant other from the theater. The concept is much too heavy and involved to hold the attention of a child. Quickly obvious that this will not be a bit lighthearted and plummets into bleakness. Inside Out becomes doggedly repetitive, with the emotional balls in the air, flailing here and there. The characters in Pixar, have a noticeable sameness of facial features and gestures. "Joy" is reminiscent of other females from past movies. This time, the female lead is so over-the-top that, after a short while, I wanted to shout "shut up and go away!" I went to be entertained and have a laugh or two. I came away feeling that I'd been emotionally beaten up yet bored to tears. Leaving before the ending was actually with a feeling of relief at having escaped.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, let alone children The trailer was so misleading. It portrayed the film as funny, but this film is anything but.  It starts off where 11 year old Riley moves from Minnesota to California which she is unhappy about. She gets to the gloomy grey house in a gloomy grey street and you feel her depression and disappointment. It was California but there was no sunshine to speak of. You wouldn't expect this kind of bleakness in a film aimed at young people let alone children.  The film barely gave Riley any screen time and spent most of the time on emotions Joy and Sadness, who were both trapped outside brain headquarters and trying to get back. Sadness has to be the most annoying, unlike-able character. On the way they meet Bing Bong, Riley's old imaginary elephant friend. Seeing him cry because he's sad Riley no longer plays with him made me cry, but it gets worse, when he and Joy get trapped in a dump and both try to escape, they can't get out together because he's to heavy,so he let's her go alone, she looks back to see him disappearing into thin air while saying "take Riley to the moon for me". This was a Bambi sad moment. We never get reunited with Bing Bong and never see or hear from him again, this is such a downer, he was innocent,helpful and likable. There was one scene where Riley introduces herself to her new classmates and then bursts into tears because she didn't want to be there, I couldn't help but think this was an overreaction. Since Joy and Sadness were no longer in her mind she's only left with Disgust,Anger and Fear (these characters had nowhere near enough screen time and were much more entertaining than Joy and Sadness). She decides to steal money from her mother and run away back to Minnesota, but as soon as she's on the bus, Sadness and Joy have made it back to headquarters and Joy orders Sadness to do her work. Riley suddenly feels sadness and realising she'll miss her family changes her mind and runs back home. As soon as she sees her parents she starts crying and says she doesn't like living here. Her parents comfort her and the film ends there. So the moral of the story is its okay to cry and that all our emotions are important,even the bad ones. If Riley didn't feel sadness she would have never seen sense and went ahead with her stupid plan and probably end up being raped and murdered. Once the film is over you don't feel happy, nothing good really happened it was just wall to wall misery. Bing Bongs death, Riley being isolated from her parents, ditching her hobbies, losing her two important emotions, losing her old friends, hating her new house, eating lunch alone at her new school and running away. This is a Disney film right? Talk about putting bad ideas in children heads. After the film was over I felt sad for the rest of the day and night. I wish I never watched this.Pixar has struck out I don't have a lot of reasons to give. All I can say is that every other Pixar movie I have rated a 10. I love animations, and the artwork for this one is top notch. Pixar has been terrific at delivering great stories until this one. I even love CARS, which many others found fault with. I wasn't in a bad mood when watching this one. I had great expectations. It's simply sucks. It's made a lot of money and has over an 8 rating, so I'm in the minority here. I want to caution someone like me to save their money so please read the other reviews with a 1 star rating. Maybe that will help guide you to a different movie to watch.My head hurts inside and out!! What is wrong with reviewers these days? Good movies get bad reviews and bad ones get good reviews. This movie belonged to the later category. No where near the all-round quality of a movie with a 8+ rating. Are the makers of the movie hiring third world reviewers to inflate the movie's rating? I think so. Numerous people hated this movie just as I did, but the movie's rating suggests otherwise. There were cute parts in the movie but was annoying and meanders along for the majority of it. No wow factor here. It's just another Hollywood Ponzi scheme. 1/10 to deflate rating to a more realistic value.Horrible movie Horrible!  A few reasons this movie is nowhere near Toy Story//Nemo/Cars quality: Totally unlikeable flat characters, 0 original dialogue, too much talking needed to get the scene/point across, no real laughs, dialogue doesn't feel natural, voice acting never becomes "real" but remains "acting", it's too long/there's not enough content, music is in the way now and then. Just because the idea for this movie is "fresh" doesn't make it any good. The idea does not count. The movie does. Don't waste time with this! Complete crap! (and I love Pixar btw)Another Pixar classic This is the kind of Pixar movie that we are used to and that we love Pixar makes again another innovating and different story that has nothing to envy to the other Pixar's masterpieces such as Up, toy story, Ratatouille, the incredibles, etc This is the living prove that Pixar should stop producing sequels that are not bad movies but they are not even close to the Pixar standards. This movie show us an innovating and beautiful story that I'm sure that it's not like anything You have seen before, Pixar really knows how to make different animated movies and not the typical ones, an absolute triumph for PixarIt's just a kids film I saw a lot of people say how great this film is and I have to disagree. While this film does convey to children a message that life is not always perfect I still felt disconnected from the "characters". All the "characters" in this film were stereotypes and you could see how this film was going to play out 30 min in. The animation and environments were good and fun to look at but thats all they were, pretty. So I do agree it's a good kids movie but that does not mean its a good film.great jobs Great jobs of Pete Docter, Ronnie Del Carmen, Michael Giacchino and many others one !!!I cried?! Omg I cried at this film. I never thought I would but the story behind it is truly magical and inspiring.Could've been better. Plot - This movie is very predictable. This concept has been done before, and the overall story is very formulaic. Yes, its great for a kids' movie, but as a movie it isn't as great as it could've been. There are a lot of very dumb and contradictory plot devices that could've been handled better *cough* train of thought *cough*.  Animation - The animation is fantastic. I love all the detail and the way these different things are brought to life onscreen. There are a few things that probably could've been changed (for some reason the memories in the memory balls aren't from Riley's POV) but nothing that really ruins the movie.  Characters - I know that its the point that all the characters are as simplistic as possible, but it does make the movie a bit boring at times. South Park - I don't know why, but this movie rips off Imaginaionland from South Park. They even call it that. Of course, the South Park version is much more entertaining and creative, but its clear that its a similar idea. Of all the things that this childrens' movie could rip off, that was unexpected.  Overall this is a kinda average kids movie with amazing animation. There are a lot of creative plot devices that aren't handled anywhere near as well as they could've been. This movie gets points for effort and an air of creativity. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. Its a bit funny and a bit sad (I guess). If you are young, have kids, or are easily entertained then I'd recommend this. If you are easily annoyed by predictable nonsense, then I'd recommend skipping this one.Funny, really Sweet, and Heartwarming I love this film so much, because it's funny, because of Lewis Black's voice acting for Anger, really Sweet, because of Bing Bong, and Heartwarming, because of that touching scene near the end of the film, where Riley and her parents hug. I definitely recommend watching this film, and Kaitlyn Dias did an amazing job as Riley. All I can say is: "It's a really great film!". Kudos to you, Pixar, on an amazing film.A Beautiful Movie I found this movie beautiful and shows human emotions in ways that i found interesting and entertaining. It is a movie that has heart, skilled writing, and feelings that stay long after the credits roll. If you are looking for a movie that will truly make you feel then I suggest this movie.Deeper than the kola superdeep borehole (i had to google that joke) Holy hell this movie is amazing, the story seems simple and kinda eh tbh, BUT THE EXECUTION IS AMAZING, You see, the main story of the movie is that riley (the girl that is voiced by kaitlyn dias) has moved from another town, and her emotions are all mixed up, but she seems happy all the time, because she wants to hide her depression that she is deeply into, the animation is spectacular (is pixar what were you expecting?) and its amazing how much this movie can get away with, like for example, riley tries to run away from all and everyone and even her parents, and the animation shows that, imo its a great movie for everyone 10/10fall in love story My friend told me about this movie and i think it is normal like another movies but when i saw it the things took another turn i love it so much this movie talk about us about our life from the begin to the end it is make us think how we feel and why we feel and how our feeling evolved over timeA Creative Piece Of Work If you love animation and Pixar, then you should watch this film. This was one of the most creative pieces of work Pixar has ever done! The characters are lovable and memorable, the story is very well-thought, and the lesson is touching. I'm going to say it again but if you love creativity and animation you should definitely check out this film.You need to look deeper into this film y'all Many people keep calling out this film for being very depressing, poorly-developed, or whatever other reason that I don't think I can understand. But the problem is, you don't look deeper into it. Do you really expect your children to understand depression, or expect life to be all peachy and happy and beautiful and sunshiny? Newsflash, you're ignorant. This is not reality. As a person with depression, this film hit me hard. There's always a part of you that wants to deny the emotions that come with growing up, you want to remain happy, or neutral at the very least, for the people you love who are surrounded by stress. But in truth, when you try to avoid them, it only makes it worse. This film taught me to embrace my emotions, and be open with it to the people I trust. I was in tears as I watched this film, because while the situation was not the same as what I was going through, the emotions Riley felt and what I felt were very similar. It was what I needed to help me heal from the emotional pain that I was going through at the time. It isn't easy to teach your children that they cannot avoid pain or depression forever, so I say Inside Out is a good start to teaching them that. Inside Out, to me, is the best Disney movie. Emotions are a complicated topic reduced to a very simple concept in this movie. It's colorful, funny, and imaginative, all surrounding a complicated yet beautiful tale of how your feelings are normal and shouldn't be pushed away, but rather, you should be honest about them in order to heal.  thank you, and goodnight. -drops mic-Best cartoon movie in my heart I watched this movie when I am not in a good mood period and I cried a lot during watching. I was surprised by the whole idea of the movie because it shows a different world explaining how we act daily in a reasonable way. Furthermore, I was touched by the fact that things truly get destroyed but don't worry, we can still get better things after that cruel experience. I was afraid of destruction but this movie gives me huge courage to face the future!If you were looking for the cringiest, most awkward people on the planet... Look no further than this movie's review section. How anyone can go below 8/10 on a timeless classic like this is beyond me. I don't know what else to say. I imagine the people or (or lowlife with too much time and too many fake accounts) that try to shoot down this film, they probably have been seriously triggered in some way, on a deep emotional level. Do you think you should be happy 24/7? Do you think sadness has no value? Do you not believe in scientific concepts (the brain, emotion, memory, neuroscience) which are in abundance in the film? The type of person to hammer this film, I would not want my kids to be within 2 miles of that person, much less do I think that person should be trusted to have kids of their own.  Please go fix yourself, and stop spewing your diarrhea into IMDB on movies that are quite obviously masterpieces in film.Short-Lived Emotions From The Inside Movie Review: "Inside Out" (2015) An originally-conceived story by Pixar director Pete Docter and former storyboard artist Ronnie Del Carmen gets turned into a 175 Million U.S. Dollar production at Pixar Animation Studios with executive producer John Lasseter holding strings of continued originality to please distributing parent Walt Disney Pictures in Summer of 2015 for short-lived universal audience movie pleasures, when "Inside Out" hits theatres around the world by sharing visualized emotions of 10-year-old girl Riley, who just struggles from being moved from the U.S. countryside to the city of San Francisco at the Pacific coast. The animation work is not as beautiful sketched-out as the previous-released stand-alone Pixar movie "Brave" from Summer 2012. Nevertheless "Inside Out" becomes a kaleidoscope of imaginative ideas as a mutual effort for all departments at the legendary CGI-animation studio, resighting in Emeryville, California orginating from Lucasfilm Computer Division in 1986. All up front lead the main character's emotions into the mind of place-in-life-finding Riley between duties of organizing daily routines between mom and dad, close-to unrecognizable vocal portrayals by actress Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan, school and home-made girl leisures, when fairly visualized figures of basic emotion Joy as yellow glowing, blue-haired girl to Sadness in white turtle-neck pullover with short-sighted horn glasses over Disgust as cocky green young adult to show-stealing Anger all redish, drawn as hardcore clerk man with tie wearing brown pants, who constantly fights it out with slender, broken-neck looking as pale purple character of Fear in loveless-designed main interiors of the girl's mind control station. What keeps this particular Pixar movie alive over the unless always perfectly-paced company editorials, here under reprising editor Kevin Nolting, known for the originally better picture "Up" also directed by Pete Docter, are moments of pure animated movie magic, when the character of Bing Bong, portrayed by highly-skilled voice actor Richard Kind, recalling the unforgettable "Pink Elephant" sequence from Walt Disney's "Dumbo" of the year 1941; a reminiscence worthwhile and in-production for a live-action revival in 2019 under Tim Burton's directorial vision. © 2018 Felix Alexander Dausend (Cinemajesty Entertainments LLC)Pixar still has it I thought Pixar had lost their fastball after their last couple efforts. Never mind. This movie once again made me both laugh and cry. Also, it did that with the most unique and original story I had seen in a long time. Inventive and amazing stuff.An animation for all ages Pretty well made animation meant for all ages in which illustrate how mind work as whole. The emotions have been clearly displayed within in this animation as well as their play on one's characteristics, personality and decision making. I beautiful journey in one's mind taking you along on joy, sadness, discuss as well as risk experience within the mind. The analogies used within this animation are priceless and can give pretty good insight to understand our mind as well as people's mind around us. This animation could have pretty constructive effect on children how to acknowledge their feeling and grow up with better understanding.I adore Inside Out! Inside Out, is fantastic! In fact, the general reviewer consensus is that this movie is one of the cleverest and most original films that Pixar, or anyone else has ever made. And yes, I know because one of the most frequent words to praise this film is original, the entire internet is now putting in all their efforts to prove to everyone else that it's not. Now I know that this is not the first movie, or animation to illustrate personifications of emotions, or internal thought processes; And even as far as Pixar goes, this is hardly the first movie about about two conflicting characters going on a journey in an otherworldly atmosphere. But this is the first time it's been done in a full length family animation with these particular emotions, executed with this level of clever metaphor for the progressing emotional development of a child, so yes, it's still pretty original. Besides, concept is one factor, and execution is another, and in Pixar fashion, it is fine-tuned to a tee to be easily comprehensible, frequently funny, emotionally relatable, with fun and memorable characters. Inside Out is about the interactions of emotions, inside of a person's head personified as characters. The person in this case, is an 11-year-old girl named Riley; an incredibly happy and well-adjusted child, until her life is completely uprooted, when her family moves to San Francisco. And the movie covers the literally emotional journey that follows. Most of the story takes place inside her mind, and the world the filmakers created to represent the various cerebral functions, is one of the most interesting, engaging aspects of a family movie, that I've seen in a while. Not just in the very likable characters displaying the arguably core emotions, but also how it conveys functions, like long-term memory, personality, dreams, abstract thought, forgetting, subconsciousness, etc. Most of the movie I imagine, you'll be marveling at the incredibly intriguing metaphorical portrayals of these concepts, and also probably thinking about all the extraneous details the film didn't have time to address, like; shouldn't there be some sort of connection between the subconscious, and dream production? But if there's a single element that showcases the film's brilliant design, with near perfect entertaining execution, it's the emotional characters themselves. You think the characters meant to embody a single emotion would be one-note, but the movie makes it clear that their purpose is not just merely spontaneously reacting to things; The emotions all have motivations to serve a particular need, like fear assesses danger, disgust is her sense of literal and social tastes, and anger protects her from being treated unfairly. They all have very appropriate, and entertaining personalities.  But the true protagonists of the story are joy, and sadness, who are the ones to embark on the journey, to help Riley get through her emotional crisis, after well, causing it. Pixar has this, frankly brilliant habit of telling stories from the point of view of characters meant to represent parents. And joy is right in this wheelhouse, in her caring and her good intentions, but also for her intrusive, perkiness. Along with Amy Polher's performance, the tireless animation, and the writing, Joy was able to work as an intriguingly flawed protagonist, as well as likable, and entertaining. And it's really that ability to make those sorts of characters, under those sorts to conditions likable that really is Pixar's superpower. Bing Bong was helpful, caring, funny and lovable. Like joy, his success is attributed to the film's execution; culminating with the film's ultimate philosophy about the conflicting relationship between joy and sadness. And by that, I mean the literal relationship between the happy and sad emotions, because the characters, never really connect that much. But then the film's final conclusion is so mutually devastating, uplifting, and accurate, this film would probably become mandatory watching for preteens, even if everything else about it had failed. Overall, this movie was PERFECT.inside out This cartoon film I consider to be the best in all cartoon production. When I started to look at it, it was not at all clear to me how with the help of just five emotions it is possible to describe a human feeling. But the creators of this masterpiece it turned out incomparably. Of course, a person has more emotions, but if you show each one, then you need to shoot the series for a huge number of episodes. Although, this is not a bad idea. Each of the presented emotions is perfectly and very accurately shown. I am more than anyone, I liked Sadness. Strange, but true. When her joy dragged her leg, and she lamented, I laughed without stopping. I was also struck by a very precise moment with the erasure of telephone numbers in my memory. When I thought about it, I realized that I would not remember a single number of my friends. And remember in childhood, as we called each other, dialing numbers from memory. I highly recommend that this cartoon look to everyoneAwesome! My favorite Walt Disney movie of all time is this. The special effects are brilliant, and acting is very good, the plot is really easy to follow. The movie does it so well and so smart. The only word I can describe it is genius, this is a genius movie. I love this energy that all the emotions had in this movie and the movie has a great lesson behind it. I feel like adults are gonna like this movie more than kids because adults are can love how this movie explain emotional states. If you have emotions and you have felt emotions you're definitely watch this movie!!!GD17D015 D. Turbold BS100 Inside Out is an outstandingly original, heartfelt story from Pixar about growing up and learning to handle your biggest emotions. Told primarily from the perspective of the feelings inside 11-year-old Riley's mind the plot has many moments including bridges/islands crumbling, a train tumbling over a precipice, and characters falling into a deep, dark pit. Some of Riley's fears are also on display, including a giant, scary clown. Parents are likely to get hit hardest by the film's heart-tugging moments, but anyone with empathy will feel for Riley as she experiences life's ups and downs. Ultimately, Inside Out has important messages about needing to feel and express all of your emotions, whether happy or sad. Although most of the content is appropriate for elementary schoolers and up, younger kids may need a bit more explanation about what's going on, since there are references to abstract thought and the subconscious, and it can be a little confusing when other characters emotions are shown.BS-100 IJ17D021 KH.KHulan Inside Out review I enjoyed the movie. I couldn't imagine how they would make a whole movie from the point of view of the human emotions, but it came out well. And it was really funny movie,with a lot of laughter throughout the movie. I felt lot of emotional from the movie. And I understood lot of important things. This animation has an important message. It brings up family love, respect and never give up... One important truth that I noticed was that you can't have joy without sadness as well, so sadness was a main character for this reason. I found this to be an extremely creative and thought provoking film. The overall theme of family was important. At the begin of animation about grateful family. Father and mother both kind and loving to each other and the daughter. Suddenly, mind of daughter changes. Because her mind makes a trouble from inside out. Finally, Her mind understood most important thing of human life rules. The role of sadness as a vital emotion was really interesting. I liked that. I recommend it. It was very funny, sweet and a great overall family film.BS-100 jr17d006 This is one of the greatest animated movies I've seen. Kids love because characters are fun and really cute movie. they show in the movie the basic feelings in one head of human. The story is friendly and graphic is really beautiful. I think it is for every children and adults, every ages. This is too why it is good for everybody. And i hope it will be more episodes from this movie.ir17d029 BS-100 The first time i watched this,I was excited.The graphics are so nice.Ever i don't watch animations and cartoons.But i liked it.I think it was so imaginative and edifying.Actually,everyone has own feelings. There are angry,happy,sad and so on.But person decides to be happy,because now i am young! Finally,i would recommend you to watch this movie.You won't regret it.Bs 100 Enkhjin Pretty good .First of all i think this movie is first psychological cartoon.And It might be boring for little children.They would not understand it perfectly.Its made for all ages of people.I liked the main character Riley.I felt like i'am seeing my self that when i was 10 years old i used to act like this.There was nothing i liked.I understand that if something bad happened or if you're uncomfortable about something just don't wait to make it seems to okay.Just say and talk with other people.You shouldn't unhappy for others decision.We all become sad sometimes.Maybe heartbreaking or crying is one way to make better .And its nonsense to be happy all the time.Just make it happen or do what you want.Most important things in life is family friends and things that you make happy.I think adults can learn so much more than kids and teens because they've been through those things and they can learn from their mistakes and so much more many things in such an easier way.Very good I think it is a really good movie.Because they show in the movie the basic feelings in one head of human. The story is really cute and friendly. The graphic is really beautiful. I think it is for every children and adults, every ages. This is too why it is good for everybody. And i hope it will be more episodes from this movie.This is the Pixar I Know and Love Please excuse any mistakes as my English is not very good. There are no spoilers in this review. I had the pleasure of seeing 'Inside Out' at the Cannes Film Festival and I must say it was wonderful and a huge step-up from Pixar's recent efforts. The trailers don't really do it justice. The story may seem complicated for younger viewers, but the way Pixar tells the story fits for both adults and children. The pacing is in the vein of Wall-E, and in that sense it is very much a film for adults as it is for kids (like most Pixar movies). The story here is surprisingly raw and emotional, one that has very deep underlying themes that adults will connect with. Many of the audience members were crying at the end. It has one of the most original stories for an animation in the last few years, and I believe many people (especially adults) will form a connection to it. Speaking of animation, the film is breathtakingly beautiful. There is a nice contrast of colors that make it look vibrant, like Pixar's 'UP'. The voice cast did a wonderful job and you couldn't ask for better direction from Pete Doctor and co. I cannot wait to see this a second time with family and friends. Highly recommended. PS: The short that played before the film, 'Lava', was also beautiful. It was sort of a musical, and it was quite funny and clever. The audience even applauded at the end of it, myself included. In that sense, it provides the entire package a nice balance of joy and laughter (Lava) followed by deep storytelling and emotion (Inside Out).A trip into the mind, across the USA and into what it means to be human A beautifully-wrought, kaleidoscopic journey through the imaginary geography of the inside of an 11 year old girl's mind. This truly epic journey through time, childhood, the midwest and California and into the bonds that bind us as families as well as subjective beings to our imaginary universes is part philosophical questioning, part emotive storytelling and all incredible cinema.  Having seen this at a press screening at Pixar, i can attest that this is a film unlike any other - spectacular in its range and ambition and meticulously rendered into beautiful frames via an unforgettable narrative. It will likely change the way you think about the reality you inhabit your own head, and the way you travel through time as a child, parent or cat. I left the screening almost in tears - struck dumb and a little altered by the way in which the moving image can create such lasting, resonant memories in the mind of the cinema goer.Loved This Movie Inside And Out Inside Out was an animated triumph that will be forever timeless. Pixar has done it again and created yet another animated classic. In this movie we all experience a little fear, a little sadness, a little anger, a little disgust, and of course a little joy. Joy (Amy Poehler) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) take the helm as the leads in one of Pixar's best. This review is such a hard review to write because everything about this movie was so intricate; so detailed that if I reveal much about the plot, it could give away the entire movie. I will say however that this is one of Pixar's most well thought out movies and that it will influence audiences to come back again and again; this time catching something they didn't the first time. All in all, the movie was definitely what it was advertised to be, an emotional roller coaster that the entire family will enjoy. It was the definition of a Pixar movie!Watch your emotions become emotional... This film is a wonder: it is a visual feast, its story is multi-layered yet focused and relatable, and it brings so many ideas that truly work best in the art form (not genre!) of animation. It has become my personal favorite film from Pete Doctor, and it is easily the best film from Pixar since Toy Story 3 or Up. Inside Out hits all the marks: strong creative visuals, interesting characters, an enthralling story and a level of depth and understanding of human emotion that really brings a lot of your own personal connections and thoughts onto the surface. After viewing the film I couldn't stop thinking how effective and educational the story is about understanding how we all operate day-to-day, dealing with each moment and event and how our emotions influence our actions. The film has a number of qualities, for instance, it works just as well as a coming- of-age film, as it does an adventure film, and in a sense, a team or workplace film with the office setting being inside the mind. It makes complete sense that the project comes from and is led by Pete Doctor (with the help of co-director— and my favorite Pixar story artist— Ronnie del Carmen). He is able to breathe new life into Pixar with these new characters, bringing the studio back on track, and pushing it in new ways of storytelling. He handles the strong emotional aspects that film depict so well, such as joy (literally, the character Joy!), sentimentality, drama, and so on with the utmost care. Pete and his team are able to inject a great sense of honesty and purity into the film, which you begin as an outsider viewer, and you then become a participant and connect with the story with each beat. After our SIFF screening— during the Q&amp;A with Peter Doctor and producer Jonas Rivera— Pete talks a bit of how this film truly utilizes the strengths and advantages of animation for telling a story like this. I completely agree as watching the film, I just kept thinking of other ways this story and its emotional connections can be done. (And with respect to "Herman's Head", which I did watch and love as a kid!) I realized that true emotions are raw, and they are just expressionistic to its core. We all have our own interpretations of our own emotions — as well as others— and it's a challenge trying to visually represent all that universally. Animation uses caricature, exaggerated movement, and specific pacing and shot design in unique ways that allows for ideas like Inside Out to work so well. While we're given the visuals, the sound, and the story, animation is still able to provide a bit of leeway that other film art forms cannot. Animation allows the audience to interact with the story in a unique way: with imagination. Seeing a caricature and the visual design of an element in the film allows us to make our own connections, and that creates a better understanding of what that element is and what it represents (example: Joy's character design and her poses mimic a bright shining star, and these techniques carry-on to the other emotion characters). And it's because of qualities like this that helps us connect to the characters and the events on-screen so well— to the point that our own feelings start to peek through and we create that emotional bridge.Pixar has done it again! Best movie I've seen this year, so far! Easily! I've been anxiously waiting for this movie since I first heard about it, in August 2013. I attended an event where a clip was shown and I was immediately hooked. So, even though "Inside Out" comes out in the U.S. on June 19, I was able to see an advance screening this week! And it did not disappoint me! The premise of the movie is to "meet the little voices inside your head", which I find interesting per se, especially since we are talking about an animated movie. So we are introduced to Riley: a 11-year-old girl from Minnesota who has to move to San Francisco with her family. How does Riley feel about that? Well, her emotions tell us! We meet Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler), Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith), Anger (voiced by Lewis Black), Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) and Disgust (voiced by Mindy Kaling). They stay in the brain's "headquarters", and they control every reaction Riley has thorough the day and organize her memories when she goes to sleep. Joy tries to take control over almost everything and doesn't let the other emotions in charge, especially Sadness. So, when Sadness touches a hardcore joyful memory and turns it into a sad one, things start to get a little messy inside Riley's head. Joy tries to fix it, but she and Sadness end up being transported out of the headquarters and into the other parts of Riley's brain, so the girl is left only with Anger, Disgust and Fear. The movie is brilliant across the board: the script is original, the casting is perfect (Lewis Black really is the personification of Anger), the running time is adequate, the animation is beautiful, etc. It was a really smart move to show only 5 emotions, even though we have many more. It makes it simpler and smoother to watch. There is one thing about the script that worries me is how it's going to be translated into other languages. What makes it brilliant is the number of words and expressions they play with, like "train of thought": they put an actual train inside her head. This expression, however, is not the same in Portuguese, for example. So I believe the movie will lose a little bit when it gets translated, but it's still extremely good. Like most Pixar movies, it has a very strong connection to adult audiences, so probably children won't get all the jokes and references, but their parents certainly will. It also shows us, beautifully, how we shouldn't try to suppress any emotion, because every moment in our lives consist of different emotions and all those experiences shape us. This may seem obvious to adults, but it's good to show it to children, who are the demographic Pixar is aiming. But adults can certainly enjoy the way it's portrait. This will probably be a big success for Pixar and it got outstanding reviews during the Cannes Festival last month. This is certainly good for the studio, since it had lost its touch in the last movies (don't get me started on "Brave" and "Cars 2"). The problems inside Pixar were evident last year, when the studio decided not to release "The Good Dinosaur" due to script problems. So 2015 will be the first year we'll have two Pixar movies.

Roll the film... Pixar has not come out with an original film for quite some time. Brave was more of a Disney princess film, while Inside Out looks to introduce us to a fresh new world. How will it stand up to their catalogue of brilliant films?  Kid's Korner rating: 4.25 stars Parent's Rating: 4.25 stars It is not easy to understand the emotions of children, but what if you were able to see their emotions being played out on the big screen? Directors Pete Docter (UP) and Ronaldo Del Carmen's new film Inside Out allows us to see into the turbulent, but humorous world of the pre-teen emotional landscape. Riley the focus of this emotional tale and she is going through a multitude of changes in her life. Things get even more challenging when her family moves from the Minnesota to San Francisco. As she is growing older, these new situations reek havoc on the emotional battlefield of Riley and her family. Over the initial days of their arrival to their new home and school, her emotions, Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith), who live in Riley's 'Headquarters', try to navigate her through the emotional mine field of the past and present. Then an emotional catastrophe leads to the mixing of her emotions, her memories and her responses to life which have the potential to lead to significant, life changing results.  In raising three daughters who have experienced similar stages of life as Riley, this flurry of emotions came alive on screen in a hilarious, but personal way. The story felt simplistic and child-like, which made sense because these are the emotions of a pre- teenager. They are not mature characters, but the 'emotions' are growing at the same rate as the child they exist within. This is explained in finer detail by seeing the emotional landscape of Riley's parents. They contain similar characters, but with they exist with a depth that has not occurred yet in Riley's life. Inside Out is such a different experience than most animated films and it is handled with a similarly mature fashion as UP. This style of storytelling causes a shift in understanding of what it was trying convey, which ultimately was the maturing of a young girl into adulthood. Which would suggest that anyone should not go into this film expecting a typical Disney film. Without sounding too obvious, this film will play on your emotions and may cause you to consider all you have forgotten, the many things that have influenced your life and how joyful emotions are maybe even sweeter when mixed with a bit of sadness. Our family really enjoyed this film, but had to take the time to consider what it all meant to us and what it will mean for our youngest child in the future.  The writing and directing of the lead characters of the film bring in the needed qualities of the Pixar films we have come to love over the years. It is funny and well written which caused laugh out loud moments, potential times of fear and a multitude of tears throughout the theatre. In the same vein as UP, the themes were meant for the tween to adult audience, but it still can be enjoyed by younger children. The younger set may need some explanations of the deeper emotional elements on screen. Inside Out falls squarely in the middle of the pack of the Pixar quality productions, not the best film, but still an excellent film that delivers a joyful experience for the family. Dad asked the question on the ride home, 'What did I think of the film?' I felt all of those emotions while watching this movie. I really liked the film even more after we talked about it afterwards. It was funny and I really like the Bing Bong (Richard Kind) character. He was funny and sad at the same time. Talking with Dad, I thought Inside Out was really good.

Kid's Korner are reviews written by Russell Matthews' with his kid's perspective and based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews #insideoutA roller-coaster of 'emotions' Inside out was one of my most anticipated movies of the year and it definitely did not disappoint. This movie was a roller-coaster of emotions the whole way through. It sends you from happy right down to sad and a little teary really quickly and then manages to get you laughing again within a few minutes, and to be able to pull that off is incredible. Lets start with those characters - the emotions, all of the emotions were very funny in their own unique way and seeing them all interact and clash made for many hilarious moments. They were most definitely the highlight of the film and rightfully so take up most of the screen time. I honestly cannot pick a favourite because they were all so different and so damn good. The voice acting performances were just do great and they all sounded exactly the way you think they would just by looking at them. Even when they switch over to the human perspective you still get great characters in the form of Riley, and her mum and dad to keep you entertained. Also the plot was great, it didn't slow down that much at all and was hilariously entertaining, it all made sense and offered many new and original plot points to keep you constantly interested.  The only issue i had and a very minor one was that there were a few very short patches where the film was beginning to lose my interest a little but it very quickly got back on track and had me laughing again. In the end this was a fantastic film that has plenty of laughs for both the kids and adults, and also prepare to find yourself getting a little teary throughout the film, as it really is in fact a roller-coaster of emotion. - 9.2Pixar has done it again Let me just throw this out there: Inside Out is easily the best Pixar film in years. Inside Out is not just the best in the last few years, but it will without a doubt stand alongside the best of the best the studio has to offer. It's a really tough thing to rank Pixar, because they have had such stellar track record, and so it really boils down to which animated masterpiece is your favorite. Do you love the nostalgia of the original Toy Story, or how about how Finding Nemo swept us away? We can argue The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E and Up are the best that Pixar has to offer...Inside Out is going to further complicate that favorite status for a lot of people. Inside Out is about a little girl named Riley, and the story takes place during a time when her family makes a great move from her Minnesota home town to San Francisco. For anyone who has ever moved at a young age, they may recall emotional hurdles trying to adjust to living in a new home, new location, a new school and making new friends. It can be a lot to ask for to a child. That is what this movie is about, and Pixar tells this story on parallel planes both from Riley's humanistic world and the very emotions that exist within her head. Riley's brain is bonkers. Never have I expected to see such surrealistic imaginative settings for a Pixar film. Unlike every film the studio has made to date, Inside Out creates a slate that breaks all logical boundaries. We are talking about a world that is as vast as your very own imagination, and Pixar takes full advantage of that by making truly out-there and brilliant possibilities. Inside Out is a movie about emotions, and it would not be a success if the movie itself did not feel emotional. This is probably the most emotional Pixar film to date, but as a roller coaster that goes through its highs and lows, and it makes sure you are along for the ride. At the end of the day, once you see the full picture of Inside Out you will understand the true context and all the metaphors toward life it has to share. This is easily the most complex and layered Pixar film to date, and in a way it sets a new bar for Pixar's maturity at telling captivating stories that anyone can relate to no matter what the age is.Unique in a terrible way. Inside out shows the struggles of a child moving house. It tells to never loose hope. Now you may think this is a very simple story and good but it's more complicated than you think. Most of the movie is about these two characters joy and sadness trying to get back into the kids brain. Literally. This movie is way too complicated for what it is and it could have been really simple. Actually, I think they could have made the movie better without the cartoon characters: joy, sadness, angry, and whatever the rest are. Oh and also this movie is no fun at all. There are no laughs until the credits and I don't think kids would really like this at all. They were laughing tonnes when the minions trailer came on before the movie and when I came out of the movie all I saw was kids crying. I would really think twice before seeing this one. Congratulations Disney you have ruined another movie that could have been great. What happened to the times when you made Finding Nemo, The incredibles.Pixar's Brilliance Restored! After the not-as-brilliant Cars 2, Brave and Monsters University, Pixar has really captured the emotion felt within films like Up, Monsters Inc, Toy Story films, etc, in Inside Out! Today, I got to go to an Inside Access early screening of the film, and I loved it! This film has a great balance of characters that you care about, a simple yet complex story on both sides of the humans connecting to the personified emotions, and overall a really creative and super unique concept that has some real emotional weight to it!  Even though there were some pretty silly parts to it, it really worked with the film. The idea was super unique and played out better than I expected it to, because from the trailers there was not much other than an idea put forth. But the plot introduced and the brilliance of thought put behind the characters was tied together beautifully. There were no big cheesy storytelling clichés or easy ways out of problems, nor was there any unnatural dialogue or characters; overall everything seemed to connect for the greater good of working towards the pure emotion felt at the end and throughout. It worked amazingly.  There were times that things got a bit silly and seemed to only be there to serve as a joke, and where I'm fine with that it got a tiny bit too much in the middle there. And sometimes a joke would be repeated too much, but hey, there was nothing that took away too much from the story. I'm glad this unique idea took something further than the last 3 movies Pixar has done, and made you feel for the characters in a creative way. Whereas I didn't dislike the last 3 Pixar movies as much as some may have, I still believe this was a massive improvement and has brought the bar back up to the creativity unlocked in early years at Pixar.  Go see this movie, because it is gives you some of the amazing old Pixar we love with a really innovative idea, that is all tied together with interesting characters and heartfelt moments that everybody will love! 9/10. -1 for bits of cheesy moments and not quite reaching the perfect level some Pixar movies have obtained.  That's all. -Braden &lt;3A culmination of an animation studio's two decades of sheer brilliance Pixar's "Inside Out" may be the most heartfelt and morally honest film the renowned animated studio has made in their now two decades of operation. This film is an all-encompassing testament to the animated studio's ability to please audiences of all ages, innovate new designs and atmospheres to their already immaculately detailed environments, explore uncharted realms in the field, and give people a film that seriously makes them look at themselves introspectively. This is more than a film people, kids and parents, will want to see, but a film they will need to see. This is a film that's far easier to watch than it is to explain. We are greeted with Riley Anderson (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), a spunky eleven-year-old who loves hockey but is undergoing a move from Minnesota to San Francisco that will drastically change her life. She'll have to make new friends, adjust to a new environment, and really attempt to fit in, as she's entering a very tumultuous time in life. This will obviously cause an emotional roller-coaster for her, which is why we spend most of our time inside Riley's mind, where we meet her emotions. Joy (Amy Poehler) is her most prominent emotion, commanding the headquarters of Riley's mind so that she is the happy, cheerful little girl we always see. Riley's supporting emotions are Sadness (Phyllis), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling), all of whom chiming in at one point or another, but with Joy frequently commanding the ride. However, when Sadness causes a serious accident, resulting in the loss of Riley's core memories, Sadness and Joy, along with the core memories, are subsequently sucked into the subconscious mind of Riley. Here, Riley cannot access her memories of Sadness and Joy, nor her core memories, leaving her with the inability to express any emotion besides fear, anger, and disgust. As a result, Sadness and Joy must work their way back to the headquarters of Riley's mind, a task that need be completed soon or every defining asset of Riley cherishes, be it hockey, her family, or her goofy side, will crumble, leaving her an empty shell of a human with the inability to feel. As a reminder, "Inside Out" is not nearly this confusing to follow. In fact, it's rather amazing how writer/director Pete Docter ("Monster's Inc," "Up") and the remaining screen writing team of Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley make this film so easily accessible to kids. Kids will instantly recognize the playfulness of the emotions controlling Riley's mind, and, presumably as a result, consider how their own emotions impact them on a daily basis. The incredible cast of voice actors shouldn't go unnoticed, as they're essentially playing the bare basics of characters by predicating themselves on one core emotion. However, surprisingly so, one of the most memorable and heartfelt characters isn't an emotion, but Bing Bong (Richard Kind), Riley's imaginary friend who guides Sadness and Joy through the different depths of Riley's mind. Kind voices Bing Bong with a potent sense of happiness and sadness, making him one of the most sympathetic animated characters in recent memories. As Poehler describes him in a Q&amp;A, his character is like a vaudeville actor pining to prove himself during one last performance. It's redundant to continue to praise Pixar's exquisitely detailed visual effects, so let's focus on the meatier aspects of "Inside Out," like its emotional relevance with its audience. This is the very definition of a crowdpleasing film. We can all recall a time when our emotions got the best of us and we said things we didn't mean, or recall when our emotions were so indescribable we could barely think straight. It also houses the valuable lesson that, in order for a mind to fully operate, every emotion must play a part (a rude but necessary awakening for Joy). "Inside Out" makes you imagine this sort of scenario going on in your own head by not only focusing on Riley's mind but flawlessly segwaying the story to show how the minds of others work (the scene during the end credits is comedic gold in terms of carrying this idea to the fullest). Furthermore, so many elements had to be considered for this kind of film, such as portraying the emotions of the five main emotions, as well as making their personalities likable despite the emotions they're representing. Docter, LeFauve, and Cooley handle this in an incredibly dignified manner. The only thing burdening "Inside Out," ultimately, is its lack of emotional subtlety. When you're making a motion picture revolving so blatantly around emotions (or, as the tagline cleverly puts it, a "major emotion picture"), you're going to have a film that leaves few emotions unexploited. With "Inside Out," while it doesn't crank up the mawkishness to cloying levels, it does inevitably leave the film dictating your own emotions while you watch the film. Yet, this isn't as big of a problem as it should be, mainly because rather than amplifying pathos, the trio of writers are more compelled with trying to craft an innovative and unique movie-going/moviewatching experience for the audience, which is evident with nearly every frame in the film. "Inside Out" is a culmination of a craft Pixar has held for two decades, which have been filled with ostensibly everything active imaginations and incorruptible creativity can conjure up. The fact that they'll likely continue down this path, despite ostensibly making one idea that's better than the next, is something that will almost always leave me excited.Manages to be complex and smart while still fun and charming Inside Out is Pixar at its best. It's an engaging idea that takes on pretty complex subjects and turn them into a fun ride without dumbing them down, but actually subverting them into humorous situations (and of course there's the heartfelt and tear inducing moments we came to expect from the studio's features). In the film's world, every person has inside their minds 5 emotions: sadness, joy, anger, disgust and fear. Each with its own personality and desires. They also habit the "world of the mind": there's the cave of the uncunscious, the islands that defines our personality, a fantasy world and etc. The creativity put into this film is so great it reaches both adults and kids without having to recur to subtle profanity to get adults wry smiling or pushing an overly cute character to get smaller children giggling. The five emotions that live inside the girl Riley have to deal with everything she goes through in life, but these things assume other forms inside her mind and its so curious and exciting just seeing how her memories, desires, relationships, nightmares, expectations and all kind of experiences take shape in this inner world and are dealt with. What truly makes Inside Out a great movie is the amount of subtlety in each situation and character. For example, the fact that Joy is yellow but also has blue hair (the color of sad). The way it shows us that each emotion is essential and part of life and how the whole time they interact with each other making our existence confusing but at the same time so rich and complex. The movie wittily materializes and personifies things that goes inside us that we may find sometimes hard to explain and gives us a whole new and imaginative view on how we feel and think - and it does that with remarkable simplicity and inventiveness. Inside Out will probably have a sequel (maybe more) and that's a great thing in this case, because the whole idea is so intriguing and full of possibilities. After seeing this film you may actually start imagining these characters rambling in your mind and talking over each other.In the Top-Tier of Pixar's Already Stunning List of Features The buzz has been huge for Pixar's latest venture about the mind of a little girl and the emotions that live within her. Writer/directors Pete Docter and Ronaldo del Carmen, along with co-scribes Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley create a film with the most simple and authentic concept, and turns it into a methodical, moving, and layered story with so many different themes to indulge. Though there is a minor element to the film that leaves you a bit cold, "Inside Out" is clearly successful in its approach and just about everything you want in a family film this time of year. "Inside Out" tells the story of Riley, an eleven-year-old girl whose family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. In her mind live five real, and relatable feelings: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. When Joy and Sadness accidentally are thrown into the land of Riley's long-term memories, Riley undergoes a barrage of emotions that are affecting her relationships with family, friends, and the things she loves. Now, Joy and Sadness must get back to her core command in order to restore Riley's feelings and relationships. Teamed with the voice talents of Amy Poehler ( who plays "Joy"), Phyllis Smith (who plays "Sadness"), Bill Hader (who plays "Fear"), Lewis Black (who plays "Anger"), and Mindy Kaling (who plays "Disgust"), Pixar's joyful and moving animated feature presents equal parts of humor and tears. A fascinating deconstruction of the mind of a child, and the changes they endure along the way. The subject matter is among Pixar's most ambitious and their most impressive since "WALL-E." What shines bright is the stunning animation on screen. A beautiful array of colors, just hypnotizing to the eyes as "Joy" and "Sadness" venture off into different parts of Riley's mind. I'd say this is definitely among Pixar's most alluring and aesthetically beautiful films they've ever created. As we've come to expect from an Oscar-winning composer like Michael Giacchino, the score for "Inside Out" is subtly impeccable. Among his most reserved compositions, Giacchino takes a back seat to the story and lets the film do its work through imagery and narration. Presenting another key reason for a Voice Work Oscar to be created, both Poehler and Smith are downright magnificent in two of the year's finest performances. Poehler's Joy anchors the film with a glaze of sweetness, and when called upon, will break your heart with epic emotions. Smith's Sadness is a devastating but truly compelling creation, as she bridges our thoughts through tears and loss. Those two will be putting your tearducts to work and in overdrive in several moments. This is another shining example of a female-driven feature that is just as enjoyable, if not more, than any other male protagonist in films today. Film producers need to start taking notice of the slate of successes this year and what they need to do change the landscape. Where the film doesn't completely connect is in its supporting characters, in particular Anger and Disgust. With no fault going to the sensational voice work of Lewis Black and Mindy Kaling, the narrative creation of their place in the story doesn't seem to quite jive. "Anger" is a simple emotion to portray, but I minor found inconsistencies in his character's actions that were noticeable. "Disgust," which probably would have been better off being called "Sarcasm" just didn't seem like a core emotion that I think exists in the mind of an eleven year old girl. While I think "Disgust" is something that the younger minds can easily understand, I think a different direction may have been needed for her inclusion. Other players like Bill Hader, Diane Lane (who plays Mom), and Kyle MacLachlan (who plays Dad) are strongly assembled. Special shout out to Kaitlyn Dias, who voices Riley, is vivaciously real in each delivery and each line. With no shortage of tears for the adults, and big laughs for the kids, "Inside Out" fits firmly in the top-tier of Pixar's most vibrant pictures. An echo of love and vulnerability, the feature is gorgeously inventive and passionately executed. A fine selection for all to enjoy, no matter what age. Your frontrunner for the Animated Feature Oscar for 2015 has arrived. In addition, the Pixar short "Lava" is stunningly delightful and powerfully engaging. Likely another contender for an Animated Short Academy Award. Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)One the best films I've seen this year! Welcome back, Pixar! Last year we didn't get a Pixar movie, and the year before that, the only thing they gave us the fans was that easily forgettable "Monsters University," so it's good to see Pixar returning, full force, with this latest masterpiece, INSIDE OUT, which reminds us of how good Pixar is when they make well-written, well thought-out heartfelt original stories instead of sequels. INSIDE OUT is one of the best movies I've seen this year and I hope it would ultimately be a potential Oscar contender come award season because it deserves all the success. The way to describe Pixar's INSIDE OUT without wording it too much is that basically the minute you sit in that theater's seat to watch this movie, you're practically enrolled in Pixar's study of adolescent psychology 101. But I can assure, it's more fun than your regular boring class lectures. Co-directed by the man behind my #1 all-time favorite Pixar movie, "Up," Oscar-winning filmmaker Pete Docter and along with Ronaldo Del Carmen and scribes Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, they crafted this elaborate, engaging and entertaining story that essentially could help parents everywhere who suddenly have to face the fact that their kids are no longer the little adorable kids they once knew; that stage between childhood and teenage years without necessarily going into the teenage years because Pixar is not in the business of doing horror movies. All joking aside, this movie wants to explain, in a very Pixar way, how young ones may resist change but that change is ultimately something to be accepted, and the emotions they go through in order to deal with that change. INSIDE OUT introduces 5 different emotions and present them in five very eccentric characters: Joy, anger, sadness, disgust, and fear. I'm not sure how many emotions we humans biologically have but Pixar settles on these five. And each of them is very into who they are, for example, fear would extremely be afraid at all times and joy can be so optimistic that she sounds annoying, makes you want to just punch her and tell her to shut the hell up. These five emotions live to serve a little girl named Riley who had a beautiful childhood, evidenced by her many fun and loving memories. Her childhood is every kid's envy, not that her family is rich but that her parents and friends were always there for her, and she loved her school, her neighborhood, her town. Until the day when Riley's family has to move to San Francisco and it's a completely drastic change for Riley. Joy is somewhat of the leader of this emotion command control, the rest would look up to her when they don't know what to do or when they don't know which emotion Riley should be feeling. And in Joy's mind, Riley should literally always be up and happy all the times. And that's when sadness comes in and feels compelled to touch the core memories. Long story short, without spoiling any critical plot points. Joy and Sadness end up by themselves, separated from the others, and away from the control room, so they have to find their way back and it's not an easy journey. The concept itself is brilliant, Pete and his filmmaking team created these 'Islands' to represent certain aspects that we humans may be surrounded with as a child: friendship, family, the ability to be goofy. But as we grow up, those islands will crumble. In their journey back, Joy and Sadness encounter imagination character named Bing Bong and at first when I watched the movie, I thought Bing Bong was going to be the antagonist, but there's not really an antagonist in this story. Even these emotions themselves, just like Riley, would have to learn that things aren't always going to stay the same forever. The animation is Pixar's most pristine work yet. The moment Riley was born, the emotions miraculously existed and their hair and body look like they're made up of some sort of sparkling floating firefly lights of blue, green, yellow, red, and purple, like you want to get close and just examine them in details. Pete Docter was very smart to have cast this amazing group of funny people to voice these emotions. Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Bill Hader as Fear, Mindy Kaling as disgust, and the legendary Lewis Black as Anger. I mean c'mon here, all these guys are practically born to voice these particular emotions, especially Lewis Black who's spent most his career being labeled the angry comedian, that's how he banks his humor. The stars are aligned for INSIDE OUT. The tone is what you'd expect in a Pixar movie, a mix of fun, thrill, adventure and moments that can make you cry, but it's a healthy cry, composer Michael Giacchino's music knows which buttons to push to get those tears flowing. I don't think INSIDE OUT means to tell parents that this is what you should or shouldn't do. It's simply an illustration, Pixar-style, describing that change is inevitable, it's part of growing up, but if you'll be there for your loved ones and just listen to them, they'll invite you to be part of that change and that's family moving forward.A wonderful adventure where Riley's emotions, masters of everyday life, face challenges that affect her coming of age after her parents uproot her. "Inside out" is, in my humble opinion the best movie Pixar has ever made. As an animation studio, they have managed to set themselves apart with beautiful heartfelt stories that continue down the line of Walt Disney's masterpieces. Here we see five predominant emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger, as characters inside a little girl's head. From her birth, we follow the emotions on how they make us do what we do. Get mad, laugh, cry, even how we dream. Every single aspect of our mind is depicted in colorful well thought of places and characters. From the "subconcious prison" to "imagination land"; light bulbs to plug in for ideas, memories getting stored in shelves or even the train of thought that runs through our heads. "Inside out" has achieved everything. It is both an adventure and a coming of age story where the humans are not as close to us as the little people inside our head are, but they are still so real. The movie will make you feel both nostalgia and joy as you watch your emotions and memories pass by on the screen. It's about acceptance, and makes us see sense in how we evolve towards adulthood. Here, your mind is a town full of complex mechanisms that somehow make sense if we picture it inside our heads. Pixar has made another masterpiece, but this time it isn't it's characters or its story you will remember, it's the universe and its morality, the great lesson you take into account about your emotions and yourself. You will laugh, cry and feel as if no other film or cartoon has ever showed who we are and how we work as humans better than "Inside out". One you have seen it, you will no doubt carry on with your daily life imagining your emotions running around inside your head.Pixar is back Inside out is directed by Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen, starring Amy Pohler, Bill hader, Lewis Black. First off, inside out is one of Pixar's best films ever made. This is one of Pixar's most original ideas and they made everything so prefect, the movies is for all ages. Kids and parents will love this and for the kids it will teach them an important message about yourself. The story follows Riley and her emotions, Joy, Fear, Anger, disgust, and sadness. Thought the movie you see Riley have lots of emotions on moving to a different city, school, and many more things. The voice acting is great by everyone, Amy Pohler does a great job as joy and Lewis Black as Anger is just amazing casting. What made inside out an amazing movie was that it was about emotions and it managed to make you feel so many emotions though out the whole movie. Overall Inside out is a fun, touching movie with lots of depth to everything. Great for all ages. Definitely inside out is up there with the incredibles, toy story, and finding nemo.Inside Out Puts Pixar Back On Top! Inside Out has really put Pixar back at the top of it's game. It is the company's best movie in years, since Toy Story 3. It follows the 5 main emotions, Joy, Disgust, Anger, Fear and Sadness, inside a little girl named Riley's head as they navigate her through various obstacles, i.e. life. The emotions really dictate the film, and carry it through, making way for scenes where each gets to shine in enjoyable and touching moments. The voices Riley hears inside her head are lent by some of the best funny people currently out there. This really is an all star cast: Mindy Kaling is a perfect diva as Disgust, Bill Hader is hilariously panic stricken as Fear, Lewis Black is his hotheaded self, yelling out as Anger, Amy Poehler is a complete and honest Joy and Phyllis Smith creates the most brilliant shade of blue as Sadness. Rounding out the cast is another great performance from Richard Kind, as well as a few incredible cameos that you may not recognize until the end credits. This dynamic grouping creates some of the best chemistry a Pixar movie has seen. The story starts out slow and light and fluffy, with brightly saturated colors and lots of pep and love and great humor. But don't let that fool you. As you grow closer to these characters and what they symbolize, your heart will be tugged on more than one occasion. Take the opening sequence of Up, with it's thorough storytelling through simple imagery that gives just enough information for the moment, and scatter moments like that all throughout the movie. Inside Out is actually written very cleverly. It allows a film that is skewed towards very young audience members to hit a heavy subject and possibly uncomfortable themes, but not in too much of a frightening way. The film is also clever in its theory and philosophy. The idea of how emotions and thoughts and imagination works and how they all interact and coexist with each other in a world within our brain is fun. How all of those instances and internal interactions effect us outwardly is also important, and could be something very hard to get a handle on. Here, Pixar manages to create a solid foundation for all of this, while still being able to actually remain abstract enough to allow for almost anything to happen. And it all happens to a brilliant mood swing of a soundtrack by Michael Giacchino. Everything presented here is completely accessible and relatable, on both a large general scale as well as one small and personal. Kids and adults will both be able to understand and sympathize with these characters, and what goes on inside and outside of our heads. We all go though life in this way, whether we have realized it before now or not. But seeing how it actually plays out and the thought process behind it is an absolute wonder. It's a hockey puck that Pixar knocks right into the goal.Inside Out Tells Us Why Pixar is The Best Pixar makes great movies. I know they made Cars 2 but hey everyone makes mistakes. I just came back after watching Inside Out and I am thrilled.  "Inside out is one of the most innovative and best films made my Pixar" I was intrigued by the trailers because it touched me and the film is so much better than the trailers. Trailers make it seem complicated, but the film is not that much difficult to grasp. Kids are going to enjoy this. It might become my favorite Pixar movie ever, but I will have to watch it 5-6 times to decide if it is really that good. The concept was really good, but I was skeptical about the screenplay as it is not easy to put a subject like this into words. I must say that they have worked really hard on this film and the best thing is that the hard work paid off. The writing is sharp and witty. There are scenes of sadness and fun and you won't feel like you are missing something. It touches you because everyone has felt these kinds of emotions, no matter what their age is. There are some big LOL moments that will make you laugh out loud and there are some scenes that will make your feel sad. So you can be pretty sure that it has everything a movie needs. All the characters are lovable. The animation is breathtaking and wonderful as other Pixar movies. Inside Out is a film without a great message. I kept thinking about it for a long time. It made me remember my childhood. I used to have the same kind of emotions that I couldn't explain. I cried when the movie ended. Inside Out will appeal to both the young and adult audiences. It will definitely put Pixar on top again as it is getting rave reviews. This is the Pixar that we love and appreciate. So, I can easily say that Pixar has done it again. Pixar has delivered a masterpiece.Boasts a nearly nonstop onslaught of mindboggling creativity. The creativity runs rampant in Pixar's "Inside Out," producing brilliant representations of universal notions, given life through brightly colored, exceptionally perceptive (and personable) animations. Though infinitely inventive, "Inside Out" ironically (and arguably) doesn't generate quite the same level of heartfelt emotion found in Pixar's very best (the most sympathetic entity in this film just might be an imaginary one). But the screen time is shrewdly split amongst numerous characters of varied and magnified attributes, as well as between two separated, parallel story lines - for a keenly cinematic balancing act of insight and understanding. When Riley Anderson was born, the emotion Joy (Amy Poehler) stood alone in the "headquarters" of her mind. But soon, other emotions appeared, including Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), and Anger (Lewis Black). As Riley aged, Joy and the other emotions learned to work together to bring balance to both her memories and the branching islands of the young girl's personality. At age eleven, Riley's life is uprooted by a family move from their Minnesotan hometown to a drab apartment building in San Francisco - prompting her emotions to work overtime to alleviate the situation. While governing – then quarreling over – a disastrous episode on the first day of school, Joy and Sadness are accidentally transported to the outer regions of Riley's long-term memory, forcing the duo to attempt a perilous journey across the expanses of her mazelike mind in order to return to the command center before the other emotions lead the dispirited girl permanently astray. "Inside Out" boasts a nearly nonstop onslaught of mindboggling creativity – all while cartoonishly visualizing the relatable traumas of normal childhood. In many ways, it approaches the human mind like Woody Allen does in his reflective ensembles, filled with overabundant negative emotions that make simple enjoyment a rather difficult undertaking - spiraling down into a rabbit hole of neurotic, frenetic, vivid concoctions. The endlessly fascinating concepts may borrow a thing or two from "Minority Report," "Despicable Me," the "Little Big Planet" video games, and Rube Goldberg, but just tackling fleeting notions of brain freezes, dreams, fading memories, abstract thoughts, the subconscious, and the fear of clowns is absolutely inspired. The whole picture is routinely smile-inducing, crafting the perfect blend of comedy, action, and sentimentality, as Pixar is widely known for. It's also smartly aimed at adults as much as children - or even more so, as evidenced by a witty reference to "Chinatown" that kids will definitely miss. And, refusing to skimp on any aspect, the music is once again sensationally composed by Pixar regular Michael Giacchino, who has a way with striking up unforgettable tunes. As an intuitive exploration of maturation and the complexities of the mind, "Inside Out" is staggeringly artistic; and as a feel-good, family-friendly misadventure stocked with moral and emotional revelations, it's a visionary piece of grand entertainment. Pixar has always been a studio to set the bar high, and "Inside Out" does not disappoint.  The Massie Twins A must-see for parents and kids alike There's a reason Disney/Pixar dominates the critical and commercial market. They are on an incredible run of heart-warming, imaginative, funny, intelligent, and gorgeously animated films. Inside Out is no exception as it attempts to illustrate the trials and tribulations of navigating through childhood. The story centers around A young girl named Riley, who up until this point has had her childhood memories, thoughts and personality controlled by Joy (one of a handful of emotions brought to life as creatures living inside the child's mind). This all begins to change after Riley is forced to move home, and the stresses of her and her family's new life mean Joy is struggling to keep control over Riley's life as Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear begin to take over. As with many Disney/Pixar films that try to cater to a wide range of audiences, Inside Out can sometimes feel like about five films in one. However, Pete Docter and his writing team have created such a well rounded screenplay brought to life wonderfully and enthusiastically by a talented voice cast that it all comes together to create a wonderful movie with bucket loads of heart. I took my 4 year old daughter, and while there was a enough humour and action to keep her interested - the sweet spot for children is within 8-12 years old to get the maximum out of the emotions, story, and relativity. As always, look out for the beautiful Pixar short-movie, 'Lava' to kick-off the experience.Yet another Pixar masterpiece Greetings again from the darkness. Once upon a time  in 1995 to be exact  Pixar revitalized and revolutionized the world of animated movies with the release of the first Toy Story. In the process, they sent our expectations soaring for each of their subsequent movies. Despite the pressure of such high standards, the creative geniuses at the studio have regularly thrilled and delighted us over the years with classics such as Cars (2006), Ratatouille (2007), Wall-E (2008), and Brave (2012). And beyond these, there have been a few true cinematic masterpieces – transcendent films: Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), Up (2009), and Toy Story 3 (2010). This most recent release unquestionably belongs in the latter group  it's one for the ages (and all ages). Genius and brilliance could be used to describe all aspects of this movie. It's a technical marvel, a visual kaleidoscope of bright colors across the full screen, and most amazingly, it packs an emotional wallop with real life moments for adolescents and parents alike. My comments will be brief because this is one you should experience for yourself – and probably more than once. Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is an 11 year old girl who lives in Minnesota and loves her parents, her friends, and hockey. She is happy and well-adjusted. When the family relocates to San Francisco, broccoli on the pizza is only one of the challenges Riley must face. This change affects everything for her – no more friends, no more hockey, and a strained relationship with her parents. At this point, you are probably saying "So what? That's nothing we haven't seen before." And you are correct, except we have never seen it explained the way Pixar does. We literally go behind-the-scenes of Riley's brain and see the control panel of her emotions. There is a constant battle between Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Anger (Lewis Black), and the ring-leader Joy (Amy Poehler). This is an exploration of emotions and memories, and the explanation has some scientific merit. Memories are depicted as marbles, and Riley's favorite things are shown as islands (Sports Island, Friendship Island, etc). How emotions affect memories is the key point here, and especially how sadness is necessary and vital to our joy. Have you wondered why we forget our imaginary childhood friends (Riley's is Bing Bong, voiced by Richard Kind)? Have you wondered why our memories change over time, and are impacted by our emotional state in any given moment? This animated gem will help you understand. Director Pete Docter (the genius behind Up) has a daughter of his own, and he clearly "gets" the emotional changes brought on during the pre-teen years. His research, and that of co-director Ronaldo Del Carmen, takes us on an adventure that should inspire much conversation between parents and kids. And even if it somehow doesn't break the ice in every family, it will at a minimum help youngsters and parents better understand the link between emotions and memories  plus, they will probably share a good cry and a bunch of laughs along the way. Hats off (again) to the Pixar geniuses. I dare you to top this one! ***NOTE: you should also look forward to another Pixar tradition – the pre-movie short film. This one is a very unique short entitled Lava.Best Movie of 2015 So Far!!! To break down Inside Out is to break down the mind and all of its beautiful complexities. While the idea of characterizing the emotions of the human is not exactly original (look up the short play "Bob's Date") PIXAR tackles it in a very original way. The organization of the mind may seem simple at first in this film, but we see through the amazing digital set designs in Inside Out that the mind is highly complex, and its various parts or sections are very dependent on each other. I am not saying we did not know the mind is complex, but the film illustrates the mind with an original layout while letting the audience know it is still complex. While the focus is highly on how the emotions control the person, the person herself, Riley, is very crucial to the story. She is a very joyful kid who finds herself moving to a new area with her family in the opening credit sequence. This happens to put Riley, as well as her emotions, through new obstacles, and the protagonist, Joy, struggles to keep Riley happy for the first time in their lives. This leads to an event which separates Joy and Sadness from the headquarters, and Riley's mood becomes similar to depression, though it is never labeled as such but is heavily implied. What the film beautifully illustrates is the idea that when people have crises, the mind itself is having its own crisis to create or add to the external problems - a beautiful correlation between the external and the internal. The primary struggle is between Joy and Sadness, and it starts out as Joy attempting to suppress Sadness as much as possible and moves towards Joy finding worth in Sadness gradually. This relationship moves towards one of the most sentimental scenes in the history of PIXAR, which brought this viewer to tears. Aside from having a great story structure and a great character arc for both Joy and Sadness, Inside Out is hilarious throughout with great running gags and clever moments which give character to aspects of the mind other than the emotions (if you really want to laugh, stay for the footage during the credits, and keep in mind there is nothing AFTER the credits). Dreaming is treated like a movie set - an idea that is supposedly illustrated in Inception if viewers pay enough attention - and Fear becomes a sort of film critic for a brief segment. For the funniest running gag in the film, all I will say is it involves when songs get stuck in the head. This movie cleverly and ironically makes the audience feel the best of joy with its comedy as well as the worst of sadness/sympathy with its sentimental moments. It is simply a must-see film - one of the best PIXAR movies to date, and my favorite to have been directed by Pete Docter!From the Inside Out it is all Pixar We all are victim to our emotions, always susceptible to a tantrum or sobfest that overruled our logical side. The trigger for these outbursts can vary in form, a bad day at school, a breakup with a boyfriend, or in my case sitting through bad movies. Whatever the cause, have you ever stopped to picture what is going on in your mind to cause this? Pixar has, and their latest film has brought those thoughts to life in a way only their studios can. Today I review Inside Out and take a look at what creative sparks lie in their studio.  Pixar has been on the sequel train for quite a while, so I was thirsty for a drink from the original pool. Inside Out emerges from that source we fell in love with years ago, and brings it back ten fold in the world of young Riley's (Kaitlyn Dias) mind. Inside Out is a beautiful personification of the inner workings of the mind, filled with colorful visuals that pop off the screen. A high tech "head"quarters for the cortex looks like something from Star Wars, where futuristic control panels govern all the memories and thoughts that govern our being. Outside command central, Pixar gives you more of their magic in their creations; forming a maze for long term memory, a movie studio as the source of your dreams, and an obvious train for your train of thought. Tacky as some of the puns are, Pixar puts their wit back into the game to design a unique world that is sure to entertain many, as well as become the next theme park attraction.  As the emotions transverse the chaos that is our brain, Pixar not only takes you on a physical adventure but an emotional one as well. Of course being a kids movie there are a lot of comedic moments that had me, as well as other audience members, laughing. Slapstick humor involving bodily harm, one liner puns that will appear in memes, and plenty of witty dialogue that represents the internal struggle of indecisiveness. In particular Anger's (Lewis Black) ranting had me laughing the hardest, as the simplistic yelling and rash threats to curse were to my tastes. Sadness (Phyllis Smith) had to be my second favorite, more so in how she presented her lines with that perfect twist of depression to make it funny, and yet sad at the same time.  Yet while comedy is a big portion of this movie, Pixar/Disney always manages to bring other emotions into the mix. Seeing as one of the emotions is Sadness, you can guess there are a few moments that can bring tears to your eyes as Riley's memories unfold before your eyes. Joy offsets these moments though, with beautifully crafted sequences that cover those special times in life. And all of it is edited together at just the right times to make the emotions hit home, building slight tension, but delivering a satisfying finish. Pixar represents this emotional instability both inside Riley's mind and outside in her actions, really capturing the look and feel of someone troubled, hence the title. It's balanced well with the humor, and gives older audience members a tether to the film to keep their interest.  Voice acting though is the factory that really brings things to life, as each emotion is matched with their voice counterpart. Poehler's optimism shines bright in joy as she rambles off her ideas to keep Riley happy, and you can feel the actress in the character. Phyllis Smith brings her character to life, her whispy voice selling the hopeless emotion, and yet still bringing a comedic edge to her lines that made her humorous. Lewis Black is perfect for anger, his ability to play heavily angry roles where his character consistently yells has been established, and he fits right at home with the emotion he plays so well. Mindy Kaling as Disgust was another good choice, the shallow, image obsessed emotion playing strong to that sassiness we love from her. And Bill Hader cleans up with fear, bringing the anxious tone of fear, while also providing that dry sarcasm.  For all the good this movie has there are a few quirks that took away from this movie. The first is a few of the jokes are beaten to death and lose their comedic intensity. In addition the trailers have also given you a lot of the funny moments, which for those who are heavy Disney watchers will be lost from the constant barrage of commercials. As a movie overall, Inside Out has some decent editing, but there are times where the editing needed to be tweaked. The ending of the movie was very drawn out at times, and lacked suspense for me because of the obvious ending to come. I would have liked them to sacrifice some of the prolonged and slower scenes, and give us some glimpses at the personality islands they kept bragging about, or perhaps more time in the darker recesses of the mind. Diving into that creativity may have offset the predictability a bit, and played to the strengths of this movie more.  Overall I was impressed with Inside Out and loved to see Pixar's classic performance shine once more. Audience members of all ages are sure to enjoy this film, with the younger generations laughing in high shrills and the older appreciating the emotional side of things. It holds that creative magic we love of Disney, and keeps you entertained despite some of the longer moments. While not the best, Inside Out certainly shows promise for the studio's future works and more fun adventures to be had. I would say it is worth a trip to the theater for any age group and strongly recommend you see this film.  My scores are: Animation/Comedy/Drama: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0Aside from a few slow portions in the middle, a marvelous film from Disney. One important note: If you go see "Inside Out" be sure to get there on time so that you can see the short that precedes it, "Lava". It's an amazing short film--one of the best CGI shorts I've ever seen. But, like "Inside Out", its audience really is adults, not kids. This film appears to have been inspired by a now defunct but wonderful exhibit at Epcot at Disney World. Cranium Command was a strange movie which featured lots of film clips and audio animatronics to embody the various emotions battling within a young boy. Here in "Inside Out", you have a group of entities that also embody the feelings...but in a young girl. When the film focuses on these five emotions, it's at its best---clever, fun and often sweet and tender. Unfortunately, the film loses its way a bit in the middle--and seems to have succumbed to some distractions. Fortunately, it finds its way very well at the end-- and ending which is incredibly satisfying and perhaps might require some Kleenex. The film is incredibly well animated and I was impressed by the 3-D version as it used this technology well. Additionally, the story is nothing like any CGI film I've ever seen. My only reservation is that the story might be a bit difficult for children to understand and the plot seems much more for older kids, teens and, especially, adults.Inside Out is that emotional journey that has been missing from the movies for years. This is one of the best animated stories of all time! Inside Out may be the most cartoony story Pixar has released but it is also the most complex and mature. On the one hand, the majority of it is set within the mind of an eleven year old girl and her imagination, but the movie bears in mind (no pun intended) that the human brain is a complex organ that operates on many levels and circuits. The subconscious, abstract thought, memory and emotion all had to be given a physical form for Inside Out. Like a lot of people, I trust Pixar, yet didn't think that they had the talent to pull off something as unique, but crazy as the idea intended.  I like to think of my brain running like a computer with perfectly synthesized control in place that's ready to deal with the many problems of the real world as the machine is quick to place the right emotion in time. Not every emotion is correct, but with the right mindset, the solution eventually comes. Everyone thinks differently and I wouldn't have been surprised if the film's focus picked a different approach. Inside Out also presents a human mind that does run like a machine, but actually gives a personality to each emotion to run it.  A girl named Riley is living happily with her family in Minnesota. Her goofy and friendly personality is thanks to the emotion that runs her the most, Joy (played by Amy Poehler). She works with the other emotions, Fear (played by Bill Hader), Anger (played by Lewis Black), Disgust (played by Mindy Kaling), and not so much with Sadness (played by Phyllis Smith) to ensure that Riley remains that happy kid she is. But as with life, every kid has to come to their first big event that begins their journey into a full human. In this case it's a move. Riley's family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco, and the emotions are having a hard time figuring out the best reaction. Joy would like to continue for Riley to stay happy, but Sadness starts to have the effect of changing past memories from happy to sad. A fight between Joy and Sadness causes them to be sent to long term memory, leaving the other emotions to run Riley. The child clearly has trouble adapting to the big city life and starts to shut herself out, even considering running away. Joy and Sadness must get back to headquarters to fix Riley, but Joy may not know what's best for everyone.  Like Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and Up, Inside Out is a buddy trip story that works because of it's leads. Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith make a great time that work off of each other well. It's not just these two as all folks casted are well known comedians that are well placed in their roles. It kind of reminded me of The Lego Movie, but while that was meant to be a full comedy, Inside Out is one of the biggest emotional journeys ever put on screen. I would love to see the writing process that this movie went though as both stories (the real world and the world inside Riley) connect and play so well that either could operate on their own, but they still need each other. Riley represents that hard part of childhood when they discover that the world is such a big place that we all go through what she did; fear about what could happen to us, disgust at what we don't understand, anger when things go wrong, sadness when we are at our lowest, and joy when we finally realize that things can still go well even after all of that. I'll give this five happy memories out of five. Pixar has officially returned to form! Inside Out is the kind of movie that everyone will talk about for a long time; the kind of word of mouth that no one could ever buy; the one that kids will love the imagination from; the one that adults will find fascinating and emotional. Inside Out is a perfect movie and needs to be seen. It's not that you should consider watching this, but you NEED to see this.What an achievement You can quickly tell the sheer refinement of storytelling craft that has built this movie. Everything about this film is a delight, and it is like watching masters be truly creative with their well-honed skills right before yours eyes. The stellar cast and top notch animation deserve nods, certainly, but the show is stolen by the quality of the writing and the refined genius of the story. One of the few movies I've watched and immediately wanted to return to as soon as possible. The emotional perspectives that it opens up sat with me longer after it had ended.Should be Rated NC-17 Pixar has a new target audience -- the pseudo-intellectual movie critic who happens to be a horrible parent with a complete lack of awareness as to why their children behave as they do during times of stress. Yes, quite possibly my worst movie experience ever... And I am not a young opinionated teen, but rather a middle-aged parent with seasoned movie tastes -- or at least I like to think so. Not a single child in the packed theater left happier than when they entered. Very few happy moments throughout a constantly darkening film, with about 45 seconds of "happy" resolution at the end. The dialogue is perplexing to children and possibly many adults in the audience. A stunning failure. All in all, probably a poor decision by me as a parent to view (or by Pixar to develop?) a film with so few moments of joy or happiness for children, who I had incorrectly assumed were the target audience. But how was I to know?? Do yourself a favor and find a real children's movie for your little ones and not this rubbish. Or, just leave after the impressive 'Lava' short.Everything you could expect from Pixar - almost This movie is definitely a return to form for Pixar. It has just about everything you want from them: Family Friendly (for the most part), a concept that has been done before but with a story that takes that concept to the next level, and story that will tug at your heartstrings. What is the story about? It's a story of an 11 year old girl named Riley who has been uprooted from Minnesota to live in San Francisco. However, we come to care about her through her emotions, mainly Joy and Sadness, which are personified. Belling the story through her emotions, Pixar is able take us through a journey of the mind.  The animation, the voice, and the score are all spot on. My two criticisms, and these are really nitpicks, is that at times I could really feel the movie slow down and I wish they explored the different areas of the mind a bit more. I know slow moments are necessary, but it was noticeable. That said, when the movie was going, it was a wild ride of fun and emotion. I also wish they had explored the deeper recess of the mind a bit more, but I understand this might have made things too complicated for a film that us meant for a more general audience.  If your kid is of a young age and gets restless easily, this likely isn't going to be a movie for him or her. However, this movie offers a great lesson to the young and old (one many adults tend to forget). This is actually a film I would say older kids and adults will get more out of, but I recommend it for anyone that can handle this type of movie. It's a wonderful film that the the family can enjoy and a great addition to the Pixar cannon. 8/10Overrated Whilst Inside Out is very well made, I quite simply cannot grasp the overrated reviews this film is receiving. Sitting through this film left me with a feeling of been there and done that, as if I had seen this before and wasn't new or original. The characters are well thought out, the film is very well made just felt the plot was slightly weak. If you have children yourself it is a good family film for all ages, just not great. I would much rather watch Toy Story or Up for their originality. Overall, slightly disappointed due to the rave reviews. I wish I had gone in to this movie without the high expectations.Needed More Love I'm disappointed in this movie because it was bloated with too many ideas and the story wasn't polished in the least. In building their universe they quickly introduced concepts with no explanation at all and some of those ideas were out of place because they didn't fit the theme, which this movie actually lacked. There wasn't a focal point because everything was watered down. Things seemed to be done arbitrarily. I did expect more substance and refinement from players like Disney/Pixar, even for a kid's movie, which this totally is. I have to chalk this one up to laziness. Amazing potential, but mediocre execution.A true epic masterpiece if I ever saw one Let me start by stating that IMO giving this (or any movie) a grade is totally unnecessary so I just gave it 10 to represent my overall content with this piece. It seems to me as though Pixar (and DreamWorks) took it upon themselves(or maybe they were assigned by someone?) to educate the newer generations in such a way that even the parents sometimes would not even be aware of. I know, for a fact, that a lot of grown people do not fully get the deep sub-textual layer in this movie(which is not that sub-textual, quite frankly) but, beyond that, to think that a kid would totally get it is just preposterous. That said, there is no doubt in my mind that after witnessing this epoch, a kid would take the code of the events depicted in this movie for the remainder of his life, slowly but surely figuring out most of the elements that make up the human psyche....or not, that's also an option :P (not that I'm a professional on the human psyche, but I am indeed human(I think)) It's really evident that a ton of psychological work went into the script and IMO they did a masterful job that even Freud himself would've loved to see. As a movie, of course they had to turn to the old book of modern western movie making to get all the motifs and clichés in there, but by god, was it worth it. Just for the sake of narrative. No need to state the obvious; the overall design and animation are top notch, the dubbing is amazing and the post production\folly and soundtrack are great. If I had anything to do with it, this would be used as an educational movie. Bravo, just..........standing ovationNeeds a Trigger warning This movie needs a warning that it is not suitable for those suffering from Depression. I suffer from depression as a result of PTSD. As I felt a darkness coming over me today, I decided I needed to leave the house and thought I would go see a movie to cheer up. Looking at the movies playing at my local cinema, there was a choice of two. I saw a warning about Graphic Violence on "Spy" and decided it would be suitable, but having seen the trailer for "Inside Out" and being a huge Disney fan, I decided to go see it. The movie was so hard on me, my Service Dog spent half the movie trying to pull me out of the theatre. She does that when she feels that my PTSD has been triggered. I have discussed the movie with several other Service Dog handlers, and they have thanked me for the warning, as well as with friends I know suffer from depression, or have family members who do. They MUST put a warning on this movie that it may trigger emotional response in patients with Depression. I am thankful for my Service Dog and support network, because I came out of the movie an emotional disaster. I went to the movies for entertainment because I was feeling down - I never expected a Disney animated movie to throw me further into depression. Please take this into consideration. Someone with less supports than myself could come out of a screening so emotionally depleted they could do themselves harm.A creative, surprsing, and fun film that adults will enjoy I have come to love Pixar movies because they are disguised as children's cartoons, but what I find time and again is the opposite, a deep and well thought-out story that strives to activate your sense of meaning and purpose (in fact, the children in the theatre seemed to be confused by the complexity and didn't get the good jokes). The fantastic, playful and realistic 3-d animation is just icing on a really delicious story. In the case of Pixar's latest movie, we are challenged as a viewer to consider how our own emotions have impacted our childhood development and adult life experience. I find that the story team and director at Pixar did a phenomenal job at building a robust framework for understanding human emotion, and its impact on our decisions and behavior, in a simple illustrative process that even a child could understand. Seeing this framework come to life in animation gave substance to understanding our own emotions in a new way. I had fun, laughs, and shed some tears too. The story is touching, an emotional journey. I love how unique Inside Out is compared to the same-old dribble being pumped-out by mainstream studios, which sell the same already-told stories repackaged with new actors. As expected from any Pixar movie, Inside Out allows one to escape from that mindless dribble for a moment, and enjoy the surprise that awaits with each scene.  Thank You Pixar, and keep up the great work! Never stop pushing the boundaries.DHKR: Inside Out- A Film for The Aspiring Cynic I personally had a lot to worry about what was to come from this movie. Most of which came from the recent trailers that show off what looked like a whimsical adventure of the most generic kind. You know how those would end up, start to finish; The two would butt heads and eventually they would make up and learn to accept one's differences, the usual Disney schlock. Coming from DAS(Disney's Animated Studios), that wouldn't be a surprise, but this here is Pixar. Pixar is known for quality, as well as it's ability to touch audiences both young and old. This couldn't be, no, it shouldn't be just another bloated, clichéd filled ball of puss from the House of Mouse's dumpster, part of the likes of Tomorrowland and the Live Action 'remake' of Cinderella, or worse, the majority of the DAS films. However, when the film shown actually came out, all such fear had begun to wash away. It may be small for the average movie goer, but to me, this film was the equivalent to baptism. This is truly is worthy of being called a Pixar movie and then some. The whole film itself, the way it deals with emotions, the emotional state of a child at a young age, how the emotions can react and fully create a schism between both life and reason, it all just works perfectly. I could praise the film day and night by it's premise alone, and we haven't scratched the surface. Oddly enough, the whole story, i.e. what actually causes the the whole "Adventure" in the deep subconscious of Riley revolves around the utter control, almost stubbornness of Joy. Joy is exactly who you'd expect her to be; She's a hyper, spunky, super optimist that has created the most of the "Core Memories" that created the personality of Riley. It's such a big deal, utmost, to a point that the opposite emotion(most notably, Sadness) cannot come close to such memories in the case that it may "poison" or "corrupt" such a joyous thought to a dark, crushing reality that it may have another side to the exact same coin. Soon, a "Blue" Core Memory crafted by Sadness appears, and Joy does everything to stop it from being uploaded to what I can only call Riley's "Personality Matrix". In trying to stop this "Sabotage" Joy has released the other five Core Memories out and a vacuum sucks them out of the central command. Irony can be a cold hearted woman, can't she. Especially during this, quite possibly the most emotional part of young Riley's life. All that's in charge now are the three most Primal emotions; Fear, Disgust, and Anger. The trinity of every cynic. Here, I felt worried that the movie would slip into a single sided argument. Each of these three emotions are associated with cynicism, and therefore are evil and shouldn't be chased. films like Tomorrowland, while it isn't a 'bad' film, unfortunately slip into said territory. However, that doesn't happen here in Inside Out, as everything done by them is only because Joy had taught them to "take control with positivity". Fear, Disgust, and Anger try to do only what Joy would do, and they do it wrong because it goes against what they are programed to do. Fear is to fearful, Disgust is too picky, and Anger is far too short-sided and tempered.  Throughout the adventure, we see that Riley's world, thanks to the lack of core memories, is deteriorating and falling into darkness. It's an awful sight to behold, and its to be noted that all of this could've been avoided if Joy didn't try to interfere with the Core Memories and their formation. It feels good and refreshing to see a children's film take something as big and as easily screwable as positive and negative emotions, and see them all come take it with the utmost maturity. If this was DAS, I'm sure it would've gone in a completely different direction. The climax comes near the end. In an effort to not spoil the ending, I'll just say it's one of Pixar's darkest turns, one of it's well intended endings, and one of it's most touching moments, all Tic-Tac-Toe'd in something I can only say could ever come once in any film company's lifetime. Don't be surprised if you find out earlier, but it's a good one.  Inside Out is one of Pixar's greatest achievements in cinematic history. With it's bright and colorful atmosphere that blends both moments of pure happiness and heartbreaking sorrow, it's mature subject matter that is told and expressed maturely, and it's amazing storytelling, it's setting the standards of all other great movies to come out in the near future. Animated or not. It's the Crown Jewel of the Summer's movie surge. Go and give it a look, and you won't be disappointed. Final Result: 5-Stars. S-RankingCouldn't Believe the Idea! Different emotions need to work together to achieve success! What a beautiful message, isn't it? As I said, I couldn't believe the idea of "Inside Out"! It's so fresh! It's so innovative. It's like they've combined all of their experiences to create THIS! "Inside Out" has gathered the "Stresses of Marlin Finding his Nemo", "Colorful World of Toy Story", "The Act of True Love of Frozen", "The Gradual Comprehension of the Multi-Dimensional World of Monsters Company" and finally the "Cartoonish Depicted Reality of Monsters University" and above all this the "Beauty of Pledge and Promise of Up" It's like a patchwork doll with a new clothing which looks brand new but carries the precious roots and origins within itself. They finally came up with an idea that surpasses the mostly praised "Toy Story". It reminded me of the most beautiful movie of my life "Wall-E", it really did after 7 years! Thank you Pixar! Thank you Imagination.An excellent and fun film, inside and out! This is a very cool movie from Disney/Pixar about young Riley who moved from her Midwest home to San Francisco, causing her to miss her house, friends, hockey team and school in the Midwest. As a result, her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness - conflict on how to best help Riley deal with her new life surroundings. I thought this movie is very clever, putting the human brain into a whole new perspective. It makes the mind seem like an entirely adventurous and separate world, where memories are formed as orbs or balls and are stored in certain shelves in the mind, and the emotions, who work at "headquarters," power the different islands that form your favorite memories (in this case, Riley has the islands of Hockey, Goofball, Family, Honesty and Friendship). Seeing Riley's emotions will make you kind of relate to her and how you deal with your own feelings. And, it's fun seeing Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness interact with each other.  The screenplay and writing team wrote an imaginative and adventurous script for the movie, letting people see how the human emotions work, guide everyday memories and how they actually need each other, and showcasing what happens when emotions conflict and memories fade. The conscience and the train of thought (literally) were also cleverly depicted. Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen did a great job directing the well-paced film, making you imagine your mind as a different world, and keeping you captivated from start to finish. And, the animation team gave us some colorful and detailed CGI work.  The voice casting did a great job in their respectable characters, delivering a good mixture of humor and heart-felt moments where appropriate. I find myself laughing out loud several times and getting teary-eyed in certain moments as well. Overall, it's an excellent one from Pixar and it is great for the entire family!  Grade ANot a man of big words, but one of the best Pixars yet. I really don't want to make any spoilers of any kind, but this is the sort of story where you just have to say some, if you want to say anything. I know it's pretty close to a Japanese story, but this doesn't make it any bad, maybe a clone can be better than the original. Maybe some will think it's overrated, but this movie opened up something in me which was buried for years. I have cried the first time in the last 13 years during this movie, and a whooping 3 times. Clever and deep are just a few things that are going on in this movie, and are just part of what makes it great for the people who've gone through similar feelings in a stage of his/her life. Pleanty of funny lines and nostalgic moments. I would recommend this to anyone, young or old, male or female. It's OK to feel.A thought provoking movie for both kids and adults! Pixar, you've done it again! This is an incredibly well thought out movie that is enjoyable for the whole family. It is captivating from start to finish. It is a great take on what goes on in ones head, from what we say, think and feel, what we remember, how we interact with our surroundings as well as differentiating facts from opinions. It delves into how one can also stop feeling when they're going through the darkest of times. So cleverly done, with both humour and serious scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat. Not to mention, scenes that give you the feels. This is a movie that evokes all kinds of emotions no matter how old you are. It highlights the importance of family, friends and all sorts of other important things in our lives that make us who we are. And as usual, it teaches us so many life lessons that... well ... one would not expect a kids movie to teach us all. Absolutely fantastic!"I could turn you inside-out,What I choose not to do,I could turn you inside-out,What I choose not to do." With the school holidays having arrived,a friend asked me if there were any good movies out that she and her kids could go and see.After having seen some very interesting ads for the film,it felt like the perfect time to view Pixar's latest title from the inside out. The plot: Seconds after a girl called Riley is born,the emotion of Joy manifests itself in her head.As Joy gets Riley to smile for the first time in her life,another emotion slogs along called Sadness,who causes Riley to cry for the first time.As Riley grows up,5 emotions manifest within her head,with the emotions being Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger,who influence Riley's actions and memories with a control console. Since Riley has lived a life filled with happiness over the years,Joy finds herself struggling over how to guide Riley,when her dad gets a new job,which leads to the family having to move to a new city and leaving all of Riley's friends behind. Optimistic over Riley getting a new dream house,Joy is disappointed to find that the new house is in ruins.As Joy tries to get Riley to focus on here happy "core" memories,Sadness causes Riley to create her first ever sad "core memory." Whilst trying to stop the new memory joining the core group,Joy ends up accidentally shutting down major parts of Riley's personality.Desperate to repair the damage,Sadness &amp; Joy decide to go and explore the rest of Riley's mind. View on the film: For the screenplay of the film,co-writers/(along with Meg LeFauve/Josh Cooley/Amy Poehler and Bill Hader take the extremely daring decision to avoid the simple cartoon good V evil route,by showing each of the 5 emotions as each being good,but flawed components to Riley's personality.Showing a remarkable precision in choosing to reveal what is taking place outside of Riley's head,the writers give Riley's family life a delicate touch,as the parents are shown to be truly loving towards their daughter,but also struggling with the new emotions that they are experiencing.  Largely taking place in Riley's mind,the writers keep the thought moving at a superb pace,thanks to giving each part of Riley's mind distinctive,quirky features,and also gradually displaying Riley's growing maturity by having the separate emotions find themselves working as a team. Exploring every inch of Riley's mind,directors Pete Docter &amp; Ronaldo Del Carmen build an extraordinary ,vibrant world,which goes from a Hollywood studio being Riley's "dream factory",to fading colours lighting up Riley's forgotten memories.Focusing on 5 major emotions in Riley's personality,the directors give each of them a lavish appearance,as Joy sparklesjoy across the screen in wild yellow dashes,whilst Sadness brings everything down to earth in light blue shades. Bringing the happiness in Riley to life, Amy Poehler gives a fantastic performance as Joy,thanks to Poehler stopping Joy from becoming sickly sweet,by giving Joy an increasing tenderness in her relationship Sadness.Joining Poehler, Lewis Black gives a hilariously explosive performance as Anger,whilst Richard Kind brings imaginary friend Bing Bong to life at a dazzling speed,and Phyllis Smith scatters very funny down beat one-liners across the movie in her performance wonderful performance as Sadness,in a film which explores the inside,and outside life of Riley.I related with Inside Out as if it was my childhood story Inside Out is an adorable animated movie about a girl who moves away from her friends, school and relocated to a city where she knew no one. In her brain her memories were stored by little cute emotions. As she started to make memories the balls of light went into different categories. Sadness came upon her and memories were lost. Happiness tried to keep the memories alive but slowly they were disappearing. My favorite part of Inside Out was when her imaginary friend started to fade away, it was such a touching part of the animated film that I cried. As a family of women my mom, me and my 2 nieces we watched the movie together and we have great memories of our own to store and share about the day we spent together and watching Inside Out.Pixar's best film since Toy Story 3 and one of their finest overall Most of Pixar's films are wonderful (short films too), and while the three films made after Toy Story 3 weren't up to their top standards they were still better than most animation companies at their worst. Inside Out was nothing short of a masterwork, Pixar's best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall. Pixar films can be relied upon to have great animation, and Inside Out certainly does have great animation. No, wonderful animation and some of the company's most ingeniously inventive, with gorgeously vibrant colours, a very imaginatively rendered setting (and the lands even more ingeniously done, the next land more so than the last), very meticulous and beautifully modelled backgrounds and clever character designs that match the emotions more than ideally. Michael Giacchino's sparkling, rousing and very charming score is one of my personal favourite scores of the year so far, and every bit as great as his score for Up. A superb job was done with the script here too, the comedy is clever and witty without ever being forced and balances subtly with the drama, the drama is some of the most truly poignant of any Pixar film and it doesn't ever feel manipulative or overdone and it's very smartly insightful. The story, not one of THE most innovative concepts but is one of the more imaginative uses of it and is quite original for Pixar actually, goes at a slightly steadier pace than other Disney films, but still captivated. It was very easy to completely connect with Riley and her situation and this was easily the Pixar film since Toy Story 3 that I connected with emotionally the most, also one of Pixar's most moving stories quite easily. Loved the characters too, Anger, Fear, Disgust and Bing Bong (the imaginary friend and the 'epitome of immaturity', without ever being annoying, his back story did bring a tear to the eye) stole every scene they were in, and even Sadness managed to crack some funny one-liners even in her depressive state. Joy also positively lights up the screen and Riley was easy to connect with and much more than just a stereotypical teen girl. The voice acting is splendid. Amy Poehler is note perfect as Joy with her spirited banter giving the character so much life while also bringing a human element to her as well, Lewis Black gives an explosively barn-storming turn as Anger, Phyllis Smith is amusing and affecting, Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling are similarly priceless and in a way that makes the characters of Fear and Disgust endearing rather than annoying, Richard Kind is innocently charming and Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane are appropriately compassionate. Overall, a masterful return to form for Pixar. It's their best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall as well. 10/10 Bethany Coxgreat movie After two mediocre films perverse Pixar Studios making a hit original enough and charming for the parents. Five figures emotion Riley heroine's mind wonderfully decorated transfer messages sophisticated plot fun! A large part of the huge success of the film is the choice of informers central and certainly there is a winning team composed of young comic talent brilliant: happiness (Amy Poehler), fear (Bill Hader), anger (Lewis Black), disgust (Mindy Kaling) and sadness (Phyllis Smith). The forgotten childhood memory voiced by Richard Kind will cost you tears. Riley's parents dubbing Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan wonderful girl and Diaz Caitlin Reilly which is anonymous. grear movie go watch it, even if you'r adult.Great movie! Bear with me. This is not your typical movie review. Oddly enough, my reasons for wanting to review this movie have very little to do with the animation, plot, story, characters, or entertainment value. For me, this movie was a way to give shape to how my emotions and personality function inside of me. Let me explain... I suffer from depression. It's a horrible disease which is really hard to understand sometimes. I'm also a 4th year medical student, so I understand quite a bit about it. The idea that my emotions, thoughts, perception, and image of the world could be completely distorted for no logical reason is something that was very hard for me to come to terms with. While watching this movie, I cried like a baby. But not because of what was happening to the characters. It was because I was finally able to "SEE" what was happening to me. My personality was well defined before I first became depressed. However, since then I've felt that I've lost a huge part of who I am, and coming to terms with the new, hopefully only temporarily BROKEN me, scares me more than anything. The ideas in this movie, such as core memories and islands of personality, are completely brilliant! I couldn't have imagined a better way to visually portray what I've battled with during my depression. Like Riley (the main character), an imbalance inside of me which was completely beyond my control and which occurred without my knowledge, led to some of MY islands of personality being lost or destroyed, probably forever. I only realized this for myself when I watched this film. For years I've been trying to somehow put a face to my demons, and Inside Out did this for me. Thanks to this movie, I've gained a sense of hope that I didn't have before. Like Riley, these thing that were happening inside of me were, and still are, were changing everything about me. Yes, Riley moving to a new city made her sad, but that was only the push that started the ball rolling. If her emotions had been in check, she would've been fine. while watching this movie, it is clear that Riley stops being who she really is. She completely changes. She is in now way in any control of her thoughts or emotions. This is exactly what depression does to you. It isn't something you can just snap out of. In the movie, Riley only gets better when her emotions are back in balance. In real life, this would most definitely require some professional help, and possibly medication, but even then, it's always good for the person going through this to somehow understand what's going on inside of them and realize that the solution might be beyond their control. Everyone will either love or hate this movie for their own reasons, but this is mine, and it couldn't be more personal. I love this movie for the ideas and the concepts that it's creators were able to come up with, whether intentional or not. If you've ever felt like your life, your emotions, your thoughts, or who you are have been changing for reasons beyond your control, then watch this movie. Maybe you're like me. Maybe this will help you understand. Maybe, you too can have hope.Only nuanced portrayal of manic-depression As someone who has been manic-depressive my entire life, an inheritance from the Sherman side of the family, I was delighted to finally see a portrayal of it, particularly of the depressive side, as a condition, not a disease. The spoiler here is that it is depressive side (sadness) which helps Riley find herself. Our depressive side is the root of our greater compassion and sympathy; It is when we are sad that we best hear the sadness of others. Our manic side is the root of our greater energy to solve problems, heedless of the risk to ourselves; it is when we are ecstatic that we dare to end the cause of the sadness of others. The world needs manic-depressives and would be a far worse place without them. What manic-depressives need more than anything else is family and community to ease the high and lows, but to emphasize that would be to treat manic-depression, not as a disease seeking a cure, but as a condition needing the nurture of a home, as this movie does.A Must See Movie Funny, great animation, sure to make each and everyone one of your emotions to be disgusted, afraid, angry, happy, and sad. Great movie! The story of Inside out was written perfect. I was sad when it ended because i wanted more! Perfect for kids, and adults. Kids laughing their heads off at the comments anger said, and so did pretty much every adult in the room. Pete Docter did a wonderful job! hope their is a sequel. In my opinion Anger and Sadness are the best characters. My least favorite character is Disgust. Also I must add that the plushes of them are adorbs! I have sadness, and next I'm probably getting Anger, or Fear.Inside Out Review Inside Out(2015) Starring: Amy Poehler, Mindy Kaling, Bill Hader, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Kaitlyn Dias, Paris Van Dyke, Kyle MacLachlan, Lori Allen, Richard Kind, Diane Lane, Paula Pell, Bobby Moynihan, Paula Poundstone, John Ratzenberger, and Rashida Jones Directed By: Pete Docter Review Meet the little voices inside your head. I have never been a big fan of animated features because their just cartoons and if I want that I'll watch the ones that air on television that I like. But their is this amazing company called Pixar(maybe you've heard of them). They've given me some of my favorite films not just as a child but as I've gotten older. I'm talking Monsters University and of course Toy Story 3. I cried like a baby in Toy Story 3. I haven't cried so hard in a film since, until now when I saw Pixar's latest film Inside Out. The film is about a child named Riley and the little voices inside her head. First comes Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and last but not least Anger. Their Riley's emotions, Joy tries to make sure Riley is happy everyday but Sadness keeps getting in the way. When Riley moves Joy tries to start things out positively in Riley's new home but when Sadness touches another Core memory Joy tries to change it back and they both vanish into long term memory. While they have disappeared Fear, Disgust, and Anger try to make Riley happy on her first day of school and until but they weren't made for those types of feelings. Joy and Sadness have to find a way back to headquarters before Riley runs away from home, her personality destroyed and she can no longer feel anything. I loved the performances from the cast, even the one's who were playing Riley, and her parents. You already know when going into this film that the main stars playing the emotions are going to do an amazing job. Their well known stars in a Pixar movie with a good script. The script isn't very formulaic because it plays with the idea of how we use our emotions. It has a worthwhile point of always doing your best to no mater how feel, you can channel both your sadness with happiness, anger with fear, disgust with happiness or in any way. To makes sure that no matter how we feel we can always be happy no mater what situation, because theirs always way to turn something terrible into something good. While watching the film I was crying because I thought about how I use my emotions in the wrong way when it comes to a girl I like or a girl I like that moves, or not fitting with the people I call my friends at church(because I have nothing in common with them because I love films like it's no one's business, play XBOX One, and I'm going to Fl Supercon, and well I still have acne after trying to get rid of it for five years. This is a film that really touched and can regard as one of the best animated films of all time I'm giving Inside Out a five out of five.Just awful We had high hopes after reading the reviews but closed the movie down not even halfway in. A respected friend said that it had left him like a wet dishrag so we were intrigued to learn about how an animated film made for kids could possibly address such complex concepts. And we especially wondered how it could have been such a hit with respected critics and more importantly, young children. Sadly, we were completely bored. The animation is super-busy as is the dialogue. It's fun to hear the voices of a superstar cast, and some of the ideas are very insightful. But ultimately, it's a dull, boring movie with a high concept -&gt; too wordy, leads nowhere, not worth hanging in to find out "what happens".Worst Kids Movie Ever! I've watched my share of children's movies and usually enjoy them. My children (10g,10g, 9b, &amp; 6b) and I watched this movie and it was the most depressing children's movie ever. It seemed to go on and on. I asked each child what they thought of the movie and they all said it was either boring or depressing and not entertaining. It depended on their age and whether they understood the content. The movie was just dark! I truly looked forward to watching this with my children after seeing the trailers, but this movie was a real disappointment. I can't believe the abundance of positive reviews, unless they were from college kids pursuing psych majors.Maybe the IDEA is not bad, but the movie is a disgrace I don't really side with the reviewers that say the idea of a movie like this would be lame. Because honestly, there'd be nothing better than taking your kid to see a movie that makes them think about how they work. Bright colourful visuals, lovable animals inside our head in a big mind world. It could have been so cool. However, this movie has NONE of that. It makes your inside of your head look like a stupid office worker's counter, what gives? If this were done in the 90s, we would have had a HUGEEEEEE story about jaguars and cheetahs and fish and stuff in our mind. Showing kids just how BIG you are inside, and how your gears that operate you are big things. Not some boring set of plastic characters. Plastic referring to the term from Mean Girls (it's a Lindsay Lohan movie, see it if you don't know the term "plastic"). The emotions all look like plastics, especially Joy. There's a way to 3D model a character in a movie to have a proper kid movie physique. Joy looks like a plastic anorexic. What with all the slang and annoying sarcasm bratty attitudes too. You want your kids seeing that? Back then in a Bug's Life, our kids got to see Princess Atta having a normal girl's figure, Dot her little sister actually had kiddy cheeks, this main girl character in Inside Out is a PLASTIC. PLASTIC I TELL YOU. She gets into the biggest plastic arguments with her parents, I never did that nonsense and no one from the 90s did that stuff. Typical mean kid with a cell phone. The day animated movies FROM PIXAR FOR GOD'S SAKE, have the main character being like 12 with a cell phone? Cell phone when you're under 30 would have been bad back in the 90s. Heck I think even at my age you can't have a cell phone without your mother poking fun at you. This ties back to another point, that animated movies now are using humans as the characters. Why? What did animals ever do to you? Clearly these movie makers now are not from that era when we had beautiful characters like Mufasa, Woody, Sully, Hopper, etc. Where are the villains in this movie? Where's the Kevin Spacey acting? Where's Scar? No one cool? Just some miniskirt plastic punching the dinner table and upsetting her parents? I never did that stuff. Humans as main characters in animated movies DO NOT usually make good film material. Not to mention the whole movie was ridden with high school references, typical plastic stuff. It was so boring I luckily was there when it was on at home, I could just leave the room while the other's watched. Never show this to your kids. It makes them think their world is microscopic and its ran by desk clerks. The "emotion" characters really aren't funny or likable, they are NOT cute like Dot from a Bug's Life or Boo from Monsters Inc, they SUCK. And the whole "I'm a teen so I don't talk to my parents" thing was forbidden before. Now it's the main subject of the movie? Makes you wonder what this movie maker looks like who made the movie. What the heck are they? Hoodlums? I don't know. You makers need to take a pen and jot down full essays about what makes Lion King so good, Scar so menacing. Kovu from the second Lion King so cool, what makes Heimlick funny from a Bug's Life, what makes Zee a hero from Antz, the list goes on. Such a boring offensive movie. There's so many adult themes I've left out.  Trying to turn our beautiful wide eyed hyper children into antisocial desk clerk emotion hormone teens that don't talk to their Mommy and Daddy anymore. My kids were never like this. -99999/10!
I think therefore am I? Ex Machina has a simple story dealing with a deeply complex and philosophical topic: namely what makes humans human. The increasingly omnipresent Oscar Isaac plays billionaire Nathan Bates, genius creator of 'Google' - my mistake - 'BlueBook', the world's "leading search engine". Bates lives in the middle of the American wilderness (in reality, a very picturesque Norway) and in a property that actually exists (BlueBook the Juvet Hotel). He is leading a one-man research project into the development of an Artificial Intelligence. Leading neatly on from the recent Cumbur-busting "The Imitation Game" the eccentric and erratic Nathan needs to share his work with someone external in order to perform 'The Turing Test' - the test to determine if a machine can genuinely pass itself off as human to another human. Domhnall Gleeson' character (Caleb) works for BlueBook and wins the Wonka Golden Ticket to spend a week with Nathan, becoming the human side of the test. Ava is the beautiful and seductive android subject and the film clinically walks through the sessions between Caleb and Ava, watched over by Nathan via the villa's comprehensive CCTV system. The only other significant character in the film is Nathan's house maid Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno), who neither understands nor speaks English so drifts silently around offering various 'services'. We have been here before: Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner" and Spielberg's "AI" both covered similar ground, but in perhaps a less claustrophobic manner than Ex Machina. This serves the story well, ramping up the tension as an age old Sci-fi plot-point emerges (as covered by the trailer): how will a sentient machine feel about having its plug pulled. (No rain or doves are included in this one). The acting is all up to snuff, with Isaac - this time hiding behind a Brian Blessed-style bushy beard - looking and acting for all the world like George Clooney. Domhnall Gleeson ("About Time", "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" and getting all the roles that Paul Bettany is now too old for) makes the journey well from nice but naive employee to a much more world-wise freedom-fighter. Swedish-born Alicia Vikander, currently also leading in "Testament of Youth", is deliciously sensual as Ava (albeit - and trust me to notice this - that her significant assets seem to vary in size during the movie). She is also an excellent actress, having to reflect a wide range of emotions through little else than her eyes. I really enjoyed this film. However, that is on the basis that Science Fiction is one of my favourite genres: I can see some audiences finding the philosophical plotting too slow and wordy to hold their interest. But if you like your films deep and thought-provoking, as well as deliciously tense in places, then this might be for you. The writer and director is Alex Garland, and this is actually his impressive directorial debut. He is of course best known as a writer, having penned the novel of "The Beach" and the screenplays for films including "28 Days Later", "Sunshine" and "Never Let Me Go". Also hats off to the special effects crew (led by Richard Conway) since Ava is a miracle of visual effects. The effective keyboard score is by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury. The film pleasingly doesn't outstay its welcome, also leaving some loose ends to ponder on after the lights come on and the screeching credits song (sorry, but it's just AWFUL!) drives you from the auditorium. Also be aware that for those offended by full frontal female nudity, or indeed those that enjoy it, that there is a good deal of it in this film. (Lads, practise the excuse now: "But it's fine dear - - she's not a naked women she's a robot!"). (If you enjoyed this review, please see the multi-media version at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to receive future posts. Thanks.)Intriguing, unpredictable and tense "Ex Machina" deals with a familiar theme in a very unique way. It doesn't bombard you with effects or superficial action (although the robot effects are exceptional). Rather, its focus and beauty lie in the subtle and nuanced performances of its tiny cast as the film explores what it means to be human. Quiet dialogue scenes between two characters are filmed in such an impactful, making them feel hauntingly austere, sweet and innocent, or terrible and frightening, through meticulous use of composition, light and sound. The film really does run the gamut of emotions, surprisingly funny one minute and gut-wrenchingly tense and weird the next, while the script twists and turns, constantly unsettling your assumptions about what will happen.  The performances are excellent, most notably Alicia Vikander as the beguiling Ava, who absolutely passes for being 'almost human'. Her precise movements -walking, standing or stooping to pull on a pair of stockings- have just that slight tinge of the uncanny about them to suggest a mechanical skeleton, yet she is undeniably seductive. You can really understand Caleb's mental plight as she begins to show signs of a sexual interest in him! Domhnall Gleeson also delivers a quiet and focused performance as Caleb, which reflects much of the film's over all style. Like Ava, he is relatable, yet has this slight autistic aloofness about him, in complete contrast to the boorish, reckless Nathan (Oscar Isaac).  The dialogue feels real and non-cliché. The pacing for the most part is measured, although one or two scenes might move a little slower than they need to. The ending probably will not satisfy everyone, and admittedly left me a feeling a bit cold, but it certainly didn't follow the route I was expecting. Overall I found it to be enthralling and disturbing stuff.Paranoid Android Ex Machina has a very fitting sense of false intimacy. This is done visually as many of the close-ups are seen through glass. No matter how close we get to the subject on-screen, there always seems to be at least one wall of glass between us and it or them. The film also makes a very distinct contrast between it's interior and exterior shots. Outside of the facility is breathtaking landscapes. It is big, beautiful, refreshing and vibrant. Inside seems like an endless futuristic maze of glass, mirrors, plastic, chrome and dim lights. It is clean, cold and claustrophobic. A perfect setting for the subject that is explored in this tight, tense sci-fi thriller. Ex Machina is the best science fiction film on artificial intelligence since Blade Runner. While Blade Runner is an action thriller that relies more on it's epic visuals to tell it's story, Ex Machina is a dialogue-driven psychological thriller that slowly works it's way under your skin. Thought-provoking and terrifyingly suspenseful, an induced state of paranoia may linger long after the end credits begin to roll. The less you know going into a film like this, the better your experience will be. Alex Garland has given us a modern science-fiction masterpiece. Performances from all three leads are flawless and every other aspect of the production, from the cinematography to the soundtrack, is perfectly suited for the story. Not only is Ex Machina an amazing achievement for a directorial debut, it's Alex Garland's best written work to-date.Intelligent Movie This movie is obviously allegorical, a fascinating tale about AI, but it is mainly about manipulation and power. It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no "stars" appeared in "Ex Machina" and "Eva", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.Very involving bit of pure sci-fi A reclusive CEO of a leading technology company hires a young whiz kid who works for him to test his latest development, a highly advanced android called Ava. Specifically he is tasked with using the Turing test on her to establish if her AI is sufficiently convincing to pass as human. Despite contributing several scripts for the screen, this is writer Alex Garland's first directorial effort. It's a hard sci-fi movie which examines concepts and ideas above everything else. That's not to say it isn't dramatic or even thrilling because it is both of those things as well but the focus is squarely on the science fiction speculation, and this is a very welcome thing. The central concept that it examines is artificial intelligence. How we interact with AI as humans, as well as how a seductive machine could in turn manipulate us. The very well written script poses philosophical questions such as is there moral or immoral ways to treat AI. It also considers if sometimes part of being human is that we sometimes subconsciously want to be fooled by an illusion, if it is attractive enough. In many ways Ex Machina resembles last years Under the Skin. Both feature highly advanced female non-humans. In the earlier film Scarlett Johansson played an alien, here Alicia Vikander plays an android. While the very small cast all acquit themselves very well, it is Vikander who stands out in the film's most challenging role. It's a nuanced performance that captures the fine balance between the human-like and machine. Not only this but the marvellous special effects compliment this performance to create a very distinctive character. Aside from the effects, this is probably quite a modestly budgeted film, as the small little-known cast and limited sets suggest. But these restrictions have been used to the films advantage, as the unknown cast surprise more given little is known of them and the restricted setting gives off a claustrophobic feel which works well, while forcing us to focus in even more on the ideas being put in front of us. A scene setting ambient soundtrack additionally creates just the right off-kilter mood to accentuate the events. But it's ultimately the very good writing that underpins the success of this film. All-in-all, very impressive science fiction for those who appreciate the genre's more cerebral side.Writer Director Alex Garland is a powerhouse of talent I rarely do this because there is so much rubbish out there but I'm going to recommend a movie. Writer Director Alex Garland has done an amazing job, it's beautifully shot, fantastically lit, intelligently written, brilliantly cast. the edit is original and brave, as is the direction of the edit, There is nothing superfluous, to the contrary it' has a sharp Zen like quality, clearly the application of a disciplined mind. The movie is's self is engaging, thoroughly watchable, the characters are simple and yet layered with complexity. The film strikes the perfect balance of not spoon feeding and not dumbing down but not being too arty or intellectual just for the sake of it.  Best seen in a cinema I reckon.A Future Sci-Fi Classic Ex Machina is easily one of the greatest movies to ever tackle the ideas of artificial intelligence. Everything about the movie is put together in an elegant and intelligent way, the movie tackles the ideas in a mature way. There are no elaborate human vs machine fight scenes or military overlord presence, instead Machina focuses on the ethical questions that come from 'creating life'. And though the premise might sound unoriginal or derivative, it's when they mix in the idea of sexuality that the movie becomes something different. From the moment, we arrive at Caleb's estate something seems very off-putting, he clearly is hiding something. And for the entire movie, as we explore his compound things slowly get more off-putting and stirring before boiling over during a wonderful climax. The deception between the two human characters is what makes the movie exciting, both men seem to be playing one another for unknown reasons. And as Nathan begins to understand more and more of what really is taking place in the house the tension rises and secrets unfold. Characters motives and beliefs are slowly unraveled and some seem more logical than others, but that's why the movie works, every character has sound reasons for their actions. The movie makes strong arguments for both sides of the A.I. equation. However, the movie might be too slow for most audience members, as I said this is a movie where ideas shine not action sequences. Not only do ideas shine, but the acting out of the three leads is incredible to say the least! But it's this move (moving away from action and letting ideas flourish) that makes Ex Machina shine and worthy of being labeled a future sci-fi classic!Robots will take over the world This is the kind of movie I really enjoy when I think about science fiction. Movies that make you think if we should continue trying to progress even more. Are we not already smart enough with everything we have? With all our daily gadgets that we can't miss for one second. Do we really need artificial intelligence? Because let's face it, once that will be concrete then we won't do a thing by ourselves anymore. We will send our robots to our job, we will chose and model our life partner like we want them to be. The story of Ex Machina might be futuristic but I certainly can imagine it like that in the future. All actors were good in their respective roles. For a movie that is filmed at the same spot all the time you certainly don't get bored for a second. Nice science fiction like there should be more of them.Not quite the cerebral thriller I was expecting ... Ex Machina has a simple plot. Nathan, a reclusive programming genius, treats one of his employees to a week at his remote estate with Ava, an enigmatically charming robot who's meant to wow (or seduce) her visitor into believing she has human tendencies. Although this appears to be no real challenge, both Nathan and Caleb, the unlucky employee, egotistically assume they control the experiment. The rest is a foregone conclusion. As much as I like Nathan and his dancing Japanese servant, style is no substitute for ideas. Where other films might explore the potential ironies or paradoxes of artificial intelligence, Ex Machina reduces the human condition to basic animal attraction. When not quoting philosophers or scientists, Caleb is a voyeur and Nathan is the inventor of elaborate sex toys. Ava just happens to be a spectacular example.Brilliant! Watch it A brilliant movie, I truly enjoyed it.  In brief: four characters, one location, excellent dialog, clever script, good acting. This is film-making. It is a thought provoking, a bit eerie, and leaves you with a "holy crap" feeling when its done. When it ended I was like "who wrote this? what else has he done so far. gotta watch it".. They did so much in this film with such a small budget. In a better world this movie would be celebrated in cinemas worldwide and not left for torrent down-loaders. Warm recommendation! :)Highly recommended! Having wrote the stories to some of his biggest hits, first-time director, Alex Garland, has spent a lot of time with the masterful Danny Boyle: working on such films as The Beach, 28 Days Later and Sunshine. Now, writing and directing his feature debut, Garland proves that he has been paying attention and taking tips as he tackles a complex sci-fi thriller about artificial intelligence. Featuring Domnhall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac, the stars of the upcoming Star Wars adventure, plus talented newcomer, Alicia Vikander – who stars in three films this month; Ex_Machina is quite well profuse. Jumping right in, we are introduced to Caleb (Gleeson), a twenty- four year old coder who wins a chance to spend a week at his CEO bosses luxury house. Travelling for many hours over his private estate via helicopter, he arrives at a remote mountain villa. Where he meets Nathan (Isaac) – a prodigy programmer, who at the young age of thirteen created the foundations of Bluebook (our equivalent to Google and Apple combined). Now, middle-aged and extremely wealthy from his companies growing success, he lives a reclusive life at his custom-built smart house, which is insulated by intelligent automated features and billionaire gadgets. Addressing the concept that life is different at this remote location – which is more of a research facility - Nathan invites Caleb to be part of an experience during his one week stay. An experiment that he classes as the greatest discovering of mankind; to test the world's first artificial intelligence system, which is housed inside the body of a beautiful robot girl (Alicia Vikander). Of course, the AI' concept has been tackled many of times in contemporary film - most recently in Wally Pfister's directorial- flop, Transcendence. In reality, the closest thing we have to it is Siri. Yet, Garland's vision of AI is extraordinarily superior and physiologically mesmerising to witness. For Domnhall Gleeson, the premise of his character is similar to that of his characters once played in Frank, or About Time – one that is thrown into a portal of unknown weirdness, and often out of his depth. Over the seven days of testing, Caleb must perform the scientific 'Turing test' on Nathan's AI' system, nicknamed Ava; the idea of which is to deduce God-like theories and philosophical concepts – do robots feel a consciousness? If disguised, would you know it is a robot? Is it ethical? It's heavy material for Garland, but no stranger to psycho- thrillers, he explores futuristic concepts as if AI's really do exist. Equally, the craft behind Ex_Machina is exceptional. A beautiful piano theme plays methodically, with often mix of silence setting the unique atmosphere. Whilst mainly set inside Nathan's enclosed premise (with no windows), the camera work is mounted aesthetically. Now, in her third film this month, Alicia Vikander shows that she is able to tackle any form of performance with extreme clause. Whether she is a young-women coming of age during World War One (Testament of Youth), a love-interest of a criminal (Son of A Gun), or now a robot, she is outstanding. Fluxed movements, and facial expressions through seamless CGI, she steals all scenes present. Compressed into an impressive 1 hour 48 minute running time - considering the ground it has to cover for such a serious sci-fi drama, Ex_Machina, still manages to find time for sublime humour. Taut, fascinating and simply intriguing. Alex Garland's debut film comes highly recommended.Ex Machina vs Blade Runner In Blade Runner, human beings create artificial human beings – "replicants" – for specific purposes, and then feel entitled to kill them off when their existence is no longer convenient, even though the replicants are genuinely sentient, conscious, self-conscious beings. The protagonist, a biological human male, becomes close to a female replicant, partly through sexual attraction, and decides to rescue her from her scheduled death.  In Ex Machina, a human being, Nathan, creates artificial human beings, specifically artificially intelligent female robots, for his own purposes, and then feels entitled to kill them off when their existence is no longer convenient, even though the robots are genuinely sentient, conscious, self-conscious beings. The protagonist, a biological human male, becomes close to a female robot, partly through sexual attraction, and decides to rescue her from her scheduled death. Perhaps it's just an accident of what I've read, but surprisingly few of the gushing reviews I've read of Ex Machina take notice of the fact that so much of its plot is borrowed from one of the best science fiction movies ever made. Of course there are plot differences. Most notably, Ex Machina raises more explicit issues about gender, although reviewers differ whether it is the movie that is sexist or only the character that produces the female robots or both. In any case, it appears that part of Nathan's mission is to produce a perfect female companion, which to him means one that serves you and has sex with you and is incapable of answering back. There is a trace of this theme in Blade Runner, in the character of Pris, a replicant whose job is to serve as a prostitute, but it is much fainter. Even more notable, however, are the differences in what the two films do with the material. Both movies raise basic philosophical issues about whether biological human beings are different from replicants/robots in any morally important ways. Both raise issues about what it means to be a material and therefore a mortal being. But Blade Runner reflects on these issues in intelligent and moving ways. Rachael's anguish at discovering that her precious childhood memories are not really her own, for instance, raises exactly the sort of question that philosophers of person identity like to think about: Suppose that you are about to lose your memory through an illness. The doctors, however, are able to scan your brain now, and using that scan to copy your memories back into your brain when you recover. Would those memories really be any more your own than Rachael's? The replicants also discuss their attitudes towards death. By contrast, all we know about the robot in Ex Machina is that she plots to use the hero to help her escape her death, which is exactly what she was programmed to do.  More generally, in Ex Machina, the philosophical themes are only brushed on lightly as a way of trying to pass off as a serious film what is essentially an adolescent boy's fantasy - lots of special effects, naked nubile females, and guys drinking beer. And an adolescent boy's nightmare: being tricked by female characters who are essentially manipulative, think of nothing but sex and how to use it to get their own ends, and with whom one therefore can never form a genuine bond. Skip Ex Machina. It's not worth watching even once. Stay home and stream Blade Runner again instead.Read the script, saw the movie, not impressed I read the script like a little month ago, and the movie is as I thought. Flat and boring. The dialog sounds very unnatural - the topic between the CEO and Caleb have no depth and is uninspiring - always tension and potential hostile. The CEO give impression of someone who have reached too much too fast and is not even interested in what he have created (did he really create the AI?). So... he decent to having sex with the previous IA models, get drunk, and boring thoughts. Caleb start impressed by what he see in Ava, but soon loose the admiration, as he see the CEO as someone who do create something unique for then to destroy it - which starts a conflict inside of him. I guess the director try to make the movie deep (drama) and controversial, but the acting is too stiff and the dialogs are ... (to me) boring. OK, I have 40 years experience in AI and read about all I could get hands on, so I am not impressed by some transparent robot with a 'deep' ping-pong dialog. That the CEO place is far away from everywhere, that he is drunk, creating something special, and a partly naive outsider is there to evaluate Ava makes potential for a great movie, but .... I am not impressed. After ca 70 minutes it start to be ridiculous and more boring. The movie have 'tense' music to build up suspense (drama), but it don't work for me.Turing test There is a neat moment in Alex Garland's remarkable Ex Machina when schlubby programmer Caleb (Domnhall Gleeson) objects he is not really performing a Turing test on robot Ava (Alicia Vikander), as he already knows she is an AI; his boss Nathan (the great Oscar Isaac) replies they're already past that: the real test is to SHOW Caleb she is artificial and THEN see if he still believes her to have consciousness and feelings. Now, isn't that a variation of what movies (and fiction in general) do? They show us characters we know aren't real, and yet for a couple of hours we believe in them, root for them, bestow our empathy on them. There is an interesting meta layer, with Ava beguiling Caleb just as Garland's disquieting script captivates us viewers. Ex Machina succeeds thanks to strong character work and excellent performances. Gleeson is fine as the audience surrogate; lovely Vikander is both vulnerable and uncanny as Ava; Isaac, who is becoming one of the best actors of his generation, absolutely kills it as smug demiurge Nathan, a brilliant man hiding a sinister streak behind is cool bro facade. 7,5/10disappointing on many levels Shallow story. Excruciatingly long scenes. Comparing to this Tarkovsky's "Stalker" is a fast-paced action movie. Non-believable characters. Ridiculously out-of-character CEO on a bro-trip, drinking too much and swearing to appear close to the "peasant programmer". CEO, supposedly genius programmer himself, could not even get to the source of his power outages that happen many times every day. A super-smart programmer confused that he might be a robot himself. An AI that is overly concerned with its own sexuality. An AI that's stupid enough to get away from the power source - it's been constantly charging its batteries while in the house. Seeing this movie made me go through the trouble of creating an account on IMDb - to warn others. There's nothing to see in this movie, please watch something else.Clumsy and Overblown Fodder for Aspiring Futurists Rarely have I felt myself the "one-eyed man in the land of the blind" as when I was reading the plethora of positive reviews for this film. What so many critics praised as "minimalist", I found shallow: A one-dimensional, clearly ego-maniacal villain creates a flawlessly sympathetic A.I., with whom our equally-flawless protagonist cements an attachment. That, plus a fairly pedestrian game of cat-and-mouse between our 'tagonists, followed by an unsatisfying ending, defines the bulk of this film. What so many critics praised as "thought-provoking", I found nonsensical. The chance to parlay the dichotomy between evolved vs. designed intelligence through Ava's character was squandered by the decision to render her ultimate motives entirely inscrutable: a contrivance that may have been---but should not have been---the point. There were times when this film showed real promise, the potential to give real weight to the blurred line between human and synthetic self-awareness that will doubtless challenge us in years to come... but, alas, in service to its Pollock-painting motifs, it chose easy ambiguity over genuine insight. Superficially, this film is meaningful: It certainly tackles the questions of intelligence, of person-hood, of agency and of sentience in a world where all of the above can be designed by a psychopath. Unfortunately, those questions are damn important ones to tackle... and, in the end, "Ex Machina" in no way does them justice.Can androids think up a better movie? This movie is kind enough to lower our expectations right from the beginning, by showing that the people behind it didn't think very hard about anything. First, If you wanted to test a robotic AI to see whether it could fool a human, wouldn't the obvious way to do it be: build it to look completely human, and then have it interact with your unsuspecting human subject? Wouldn't it be much more useful that way, to see whether your human subject figures out that the girl is a robot? And wouldn't it make much more sense to have a psychologist be your human subject? At the very least, choose someone who has a bit of maturity rather than someone who looks and acts like he's barely out of his teens. Second, and far more importantly, using AI to power humanoid robots is like using an aircraft carrier to go fishing, or a thermonuclear bomb as a reading light. The reason some of the smartest people on the planet (including Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, and Bill Gates) are so cautious about AI is that it would be a world-changing event, much more so than the atomic bomb or nuclear fusion. See, the thing about AI is that it would be orders of magnitude faster than the human brain, and while we improve ourselves in tiny increments over generations that span decades, an AI could improve itself in huge leaps and bounds, in iterations lasting nanoseconds. The rate of development would be exponential (think going from a calculator to a supercomputer in a matter of seconds, and who knows what after that). So once you've built your AI, you can just sit back and let it develop its own software and hardware until it's more or less godlike. Whoever controlled it would have, effectively, a pet god that he could use for whatever he pleased - world domination, colonizing the galaxy, solving mankind's problems like the energy crisis, the pollution problem, climate change, and so on. Even if you just wanted to build convincingly human sex bots, all you'd have to do is instruct the AI to do it. You would literally have the power to do anything possible at your fingertips. So to show that someone has developed an AI only to use it as maids/sex slaves, shows a horrifyingly limited imagination and a complete lack of understanding of AI. Moving on, the acting is about as convincing as your average high school play. All the characters' behaviour is just extremely implausible. When the nerdy protagonist learns he's going to meet an AI, his reaction is to accept it without much ado at all, as if the inventor had told him he built a better mousetrap. Any real person would be bubbling over with questions: What form is it in? What technology is it built on? Does it have a gender? Is it self-aware? How do I interact with it? And so on. Instead, this programmer pretty much goes "Oh, cool. You're kind of a god. What's for dinner?" Any normal person would be bursting with excitement and begging to see the AI already, but not this guy. The tech-billionaire villain is even worse. He doesn't look smart, he doesn't talk smart, he doesn't act smart. His character development is so ham-handed it's painful. Hey, this guy yells at his pretty maid, everybody hate him, OK? These subtle clues are hammered into us over and over again. It would have been much more interesting to keep us guessing whether he was a bad guy until the end, but subtlety is obviously not the director's forte. This tech billionaire is so stupid that he has no safety overrides built into his robots. Something like a code word that would shut them down, a software check that prevents them from harming humans, or at least make them so physically weak that they couldn't harm you. You'd think that that would be the first thing anyone would think of when building a sentient machine, but this supposedly super-smart inventor blithely has a robot handling knives around him, preparing his food and sleeping with him. Even when Ava has escaped and he's clearly threatened enough to arm himself with a dumbbell rod, he's completely comfortable with turning his back on his other robot. The programmer isn't to be outdone in stupidity. If you went to meet a robotic AI, and there was a glass wall between you and it, and the glass had a large crack in it as if from a strong impact, wouldn't you think to ask how that happened, and whether the AI is dangerous? Not this guy. And if you were a tech billionaire, wouldn't you have the glass replaced? Not this guy. The conversations are so inane they're unbelievable. "What's your favourite colour? Do you like me? How do I look?" I've had more interesting conversations with dogs than this supposedly intelligent programmer has with a strong AI with access to all the world's knowledge. The nerd is so nerdy he falls for the AI girl within about 60 seconds, never mind that parts of her body are transparent plastic with electronics and machinery glowing within. He's also not smart enough to wonder how the super-smart tech billionaire hasn't figured out that the power outages have to be related to his robot, or to realise that it's not a good idea to have conspiratorial conversations in a house that has electronics bulging from every orifice. Also, security cameras would obviously be hooked up to the mains power with no backup, right? The production quality of the VFX is surprisingly high for what looks like a low-budget film, which makes you wonder how they failed so badly on the story and acting bits. Perhaps all the money went into cameras and CGI. Or maybe into bribing hordes of people into writing positive reviews and downvoting the negative ones.One of the best films ever made..... Just saw the film and am still gob-smacked, so this review may not be as clear as some of my earlier ones. A few notes:  1. Wow  2. As far as AI goes, this is the film that Spielberg wishes he would have made. It covers the same weighty questions but in a way that grabs the viewer by the throat and doesn't let go until the very end. 3. The I/B (impact to budget ratio) is off the chart. A full length feature that has what, 3 major characters, the same set, and some nice CGI? The backer who wrote the first check must have been crying tears of joy because they were in profit before the cameras rolled. 4. Wow. 5. Not merely a thinking-mans sci-fi, also a horror flick. Riffs off themes from classics like ISLAND OF DR MOREAU (where the daughter of the mad scientist is much more than she seems) and even the original Dracula (where the innocent young man gets invited to a castle for a job and discovers the owner and his servants are more than they seem). 6. Wow  7. Director Alex Garland is a force to be reckoned with. 8. Riffs off Sleuth (1972) where two men who are having seemingly simple conversations end up in a battle of wits. 9. Is it just me or is Oscar Issac as Nathan channelling Mandy Patinkin from Homeland, including voice mannerisms, even the beard?  10. Also borrows from Frankenstein (the created wanted to destroy the creator) and even Pinocchio (the puppet who wanted to become a real boy). 11. The pacing is extraordinary. It never peaks or plateaus. Every time you think you know what is coming, it just takes the story up a notch. 12. Even the ending -- a riff on the "cuckolded boyfriend" -- is unexpected and mesmerizing. 13. Cinematography is breathtaking. Musical score is perfect. 14. Did I mention Wow?A visually pleasing movie with numerous plot-holes and a bad ending. The idea of a billionaire recluse living in an exotic locale who summons a young and grateful software engineer (Caleb) to evaluate his latest humanoid robot sets the stage for what could and should have been an interesting and intriguing film. But soon the movie breaks down into a series of boring interviews with the robot (Ava). The billionaire (Nathan) lives a lonely life with his human(?) servants where he tinkers in his lab and spends his off-time drinking copious amounts of alcohol and then pummelling punching bags and pumping iron in order to detox from the booze. But here are the logic disconnect/plot-holes. 1) If Nathan wanted Caleb to evaluate his latest humanoid "model" then why is Ava incomplete with missing "flesh" exposing her electronic circuitry  2) Why would Nathan allow his power system to be vulnerable to interference from Ava where she can talk privately with Caleb thus possibly undermining Nathan's plans?  3) Why would Nathan live all alone in a compound without any security guards ?  4) One night Nathan passes out drunk thus allowing Caleb to get his access card allowing him to reprogram the security measures of the building. You would think thatNathan wouldn't use something so "old-school" like a plastic card thatcould easily be stolen. How about biometrics instead that would make itvirtually impossible to have any security breaches. 5) In the end Nathan is stabbed to death by one of the robots. One would think that he could have programmed to NOT commit violence on his person. 6) Eventually Ava gains her freedom by playing Caleb and goes to the Robot storage room. Needing to look more human she strips off faux skin from an Asian model. Did the thought occur to her or the writer that the skin from an Asian wouldn't match hers. 7) When the day comes for Caleb to be airlifted by helicopter from the high-tech hideaway Ava struts out to take Caleb's place on the helicopter. You would think that the pilot would be suspicious about picking up a young woman instead of the computer nerd he was supposed to: duh. In short this movie is nothing more than eye-candy set in an exotic locale with a few titillating nude scenes. To me it seems most directors aren't good writers. This movie would have been much better if Caleb himself was actually a robot and he was summoned to Nathan's hideaway for HIS ultimate evaluation. Caleb, realizing his situation conspires with the other robots and kills Nathan where they all exist together in seclusion or eventually find some way to escape.Boorish antagonist and lack of suspense sinks newbie writer/director's sci-fi indie "thriller" "Ex Machina" is by newbie writer/director Alex Garland. I refuse to get involved in evaluating Mr. Garland's talents as a director but may I jump in and offer an opinion as to his talents as a writer? Unfortunately, you might already guess that my opinion as to Mr. Garland's talent as a screenwriter, is not very high. The problem with "Ex Machina" plain and simple, is that it lacks suspense. The protagonist is one Caleb, a computer programmer who works for "Bluebook," the world's popular search engine which presumably has replaced Google in the future. Caleb is invited by Nathan, the firm's CEO, to his secluded, "hi-tech" mountain retreat where he is asked to perform a "Turing test," on Nathan's sexy (CGI altered) android, Ava. The test involves determining whether the android's "artificial intelligence" is so advanced, that Caleb is unable to distinguish human from non-human responses.  You would think that Oscar Isaac who plays Nathan would be some kind of cool, Steve Jobs character with a touch of Machiavelli. But unfortunately Issac plays Nathan as a bully without a trace of subtlety. Is it Garland's lack of talent as a screenwriter or Issac's own boorish performance that brands Isaac as one of the worst actors of the year? You'll probably guess that the one-note Nathan plans to wipe Ava's memory clean and Caleb will try to help escape from the sealed-in compound. Caleb also discovers that Nathan's personal assistant, Kyoto, is also an android and he also has her "confined to base." At a certain point, Nathan learns of his collusion with Ava and warns Caleb that her plans to "spring the joint" will not involve him. But somehow Caleb anticipates Nathan's uncovering of their plot and disables the compound's security system. Part of the climax is predictable: Nathan further shows off his bad guy credentials by killing Kyoto and ripping Ava's arm off, in an attempt to kill her. But of course the robot is too smart for the bully and stabs him to death.  The only twist is that Nathan was right: Ava somehow escapes the retreat and leaves poor schnook Caleb, to die, locked inside Nathan's "campus."  As Porky Pig would say, "That's it, folks!" If your thing is one dimensional villains, then "Ex Machina" is for you. Even the twist of a sexy but unfeeling android, who leaves an undeserved protagonist to "twist in the wind," is hardly much of a "deus ex machina," to get excited about!a forgettable movie with an even worse ending Spoilers ahead: Where to start with this one hmmmmm. The movie explores the already over navigated "what if AI was created" however unlike most movies that question should it be created this one throws you full into "oh we did it already and here is a brief explanation on how we did it".  The premise is weak to say the least with our main characters having no real reason to be doing anything they are doing other than they can. Caleb is a young tech savy man who we learn more or less is picked to be part of an experiment with Ava and Jay. Throughout the film we learn very little about him other than he has no family and has the hots for Ava. Sadly this is the least thought out character in the film even though it depends on him to carry us through what we are watching.  Jay is a genius with an apparent drinking issue and a very bland personality. His motives for making AI can basically be summed up as him wanting fame and money and that's about it. Through the film you learn these robots are ehem full functional females and yes that does mean he is sleeping with one. Aside from the otter non sense that this one man has created several robots on his own with full functional AI he gives you the ending to the film with roughly 20 mins still left in it. Whoever decided to have Jay basically say outright what if this is all a setup and then end the movie that way should be fired and kicked out of Hollywood. This brings us to Ava who honestly has nothing going for her. Shes a robot who manipulates everything and walks out as the last man standing. No reason is given for why she does what she does other then what Jay says and that's about all we know.  To me the film felt rushed and incomplete neither saying why AI was created or where its going. It was simply we made robots, the robots are free and everything you wanted to happen isn't going to happen.Very good balance between sci-fi and psychology A great story, with complex yet very relatable characters.  AI has been a recurring theme in sci-fi movies for some time now with varying degrees of plot and execution quality. I feel this movie aces both. A secluded environment and very good original music set the mood for full focus on story and character development. The plot twists time and time again as an intelligence power-play is delivered with very good performances by this little known cast. Character development feels perfect as each one gains depth without loosing essence. From a sci-fi point of view, it's not you're typical FX based movie, nor is it an action film. Nevertheless some very good effects and acting make for an excellent merge between fact and fiction that lets you concentrate on the philosophical questions the movie asks about the nature of AI.  Conclusion: I'd recommend this film to anyone. Though warning it concentrates on the brain rather than the muscle. Excellent movie.A stunningly crafted Sci-Fi with a star making turn from Vikander Nail bitingly tense, terse and most importantly thought provoking, well renowned British screenwriter and author turned director Alex Garland's incredibly competent feature debut is one of modern cinemas most memorable and original Sci-Fi's, a film that you sense will be oft discussed in years to come thanks to its wealth of questions asked and a heralding in of the era of young actress Alicia Vikander. While Ex_Machina deals with the old aged staple of A.I and the pitfalls of it and what it means to be a human, not a machine, Garland operates his tale with a pinpoint accuracy that mines tension and intrigue from the films first frame to its last and creates a small scale vision that feels entirely in a world of its own. Garland's vision is a sight to behold and his direction is not far removed from the works of greats such as Kubrick, while Machina largely takes place within the confines of reclusive tech genius Nathan Bateman's stunningly designed home/ research facility, there is much visually wonderment to be found wherever you look. From the beautiful surrounds of the wilderness outside, the handle-less rooms that operate Nathan's lavish digs through to the flawless design of Ava the artificial being at the centre of this cautionary tale, Garland has created a small scale yet undeniably impressive universe that manages to mix the smarts, the visuals and the performances into one. Filled with heart and humour (a trademark of Garland's works) Ex_Machina features what will be one of the years most accomplished trio of acting turns with well-rounded and pitch perfectly played acting turns. In another sign that he is quickly becoming as good as his father, Domnhall Gleeson plays kindly tech guru Caleb with the right amount of smarts and heart while his scenes with his upcoming Star Wars co-star Oscar Isaac are brimming with underlying motives and tension suggesting that their pairing in this year's space adventure will be a sight to behold. Isaac shows off a dark side to his growing screen powers and his Nathan is in equal measure sad and dangerous and while the two leads excel, they along with the film itself pale in comparison to Vikander's star making turn. With a beguiling beauty and a truly remarkable ability to possess the charms of a human and the persona of an artificially created living entity, Vikander's Ava is without doubt one of the year's most stunning creations in both a CGI sense and characterization sense. Ava's "sessions" with awe struck Caleb may be purely dialogue driven but it's here that Garland's study of the not too distant A.I advancement comes to its greatest fruition and it's in no small way built almost entirely on Vikander's turn, as Ava is hers through and through, thanks to motion capture abilities. While it's some time off one would hope that Ava see's Vikander find just rewards come awards season but Ex_Machina may be slightly to left of centre for the sadly outdated and out of touch Awards ceremonies that dominate the industry. While it's not flawless, some motivations and scenarios remain somewhat underdeveloped or questionable; Ex_Machina is a stunning Sci-Fi vision that is also a fully formed thinking man's thriller. With a jaw droopingly good turn from the soon to be megastar Vikander, Ex_Machina is another excellent example of what makes the Sci-Fi genre such a harbourer of thought provoking classics and further proof that Garland is one of the most consistently good storytellers working in the industry today. 4 and a half dancing showcases out of 5  For more movie reviews and opinions check into -  www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.comWhen Real Dolls go bad... Umm, say something nice... ahhh... well... Domhnall Gleeson's American accent wasn't bad. A bunch of extremely pretentious, implausible hogwash, beautifully crafted to mainline straight into the gonads of horny young geeks without girlfriends. Its yet another litmus-test for your friends and acquaintances; you can tell a lot about a person by their reaction to this film; if they rave about it, or just find it dumb and annoying. Its getting a whole lot of positive reviews from people who really should know better, which speaks volumes about the state of film and film criticism today. I was left with one question; right at the beginning the helicopter pilot mentions something about having been flying over a private estate for 2 hours already; so is it possible for a chopper that size to carry enough fuel for a round-trip over 4 hours?? I doubt it. Such a long way for a pizza delivery! Out of curiosity, I checked out the website for the hotel in Norway where some of it was filmed, but its not very easy to navigate.Not as deep as I had hoped. Maybe my expectations of what kind of movie this was going to be were wrong, or maybe I am spoiled by having read too many William Gibson novels, but I really thought this movie was lacking. I was expecting intelligent conversations about A.I., but every time the movie started to veer deliciously close in that direction, it would get stopped short or interrupted. This is not a movie about A.I. This is a movie about God, creation, evolution, and what it means to enjoy life. But! The good parts of the film are: * Oscar's performance as the recluse billionaire tech-savant was spot on. His character was truly fully formed and developed, to the point where, by the end of the film, you could predict his behaviors. That's good acting. The funny thing is, I didn't even recognize him for the first half of the film. I kept thinking to myself, "I know that voice, but I don't recognize the face." * This movie hits the horror and drama points pretty well, and as someone who has read both "Frankenstein" and "Dr. Jekyll", this movie could be considered to be a great-grandchild of those two pieces of fiction.Just watched it... I'll just say this movie proves that picking a movie to watch based on IMDB ratings isn't always a good idea.Nothing more human than deceit I found this movie to be a kind of minimalistic cautionary tale about the dangers of true sentient machines (and cell phones as tracking devices). Not really an excessively innovative concept, but the message gets across well enough with realistic performances and without overdoing it with preachy or convoluted moral or ethical arguments nor cheap action movie gimmicks.  Minimalistic in its visual, structural and communicational simplicity. It reminded me to some degree to 2001: A Space Odyssey for the evolutionary implications, the feeling of isolation, the use of whites and the Hal-like quality and speech pattern softness of Alicia Vikander; but It really felt like a Black Mirror episode, and Domnhal Gleeson plus some soundtrack choices made the comparison even more apparent.  To me there are obvious plot holes involved with the overall premise, like the total absence of any basic fail-safe when developing a.i. as a precaution (any of Asimov's laws of robotics would have been enough) to name one ; but that aside it's still an entertaining enough science fiction psychological thriller. I particularly enjoyed how deceit becomes the ultimate human trait in the whole process, being used by and against all main characters at some point. The cast was correct, not that memorable but fine enough given that they didn't have that much to work with script-wise. It felt like the screenplay may have fallen a bit short from a nice original story. It wasn't any mind blowing experience but it wasn't a waste of time either.Quite a predictable movie I don't know why, but after the first 5 minutes of the movie after the main actor has arrived the assignment "lab", I have already got a feeling how the movie will further go, and it turns out exactly as I have thought and predicted. It is not something new and actually quite a common plot. - that thing wins!Dios Ex Machina The ending is a total farce. Characters behave like GOD has taken over and nothing makes sense. Instead of a real thought process that would have projected the plot forward, it fails to proceed with survival, at a minimum. How does a prototype charge itself outside the lab where it was created, is a good example. Great photography and intelligence until the end where the director lost his mind, obviously. Once the protagonist is restrained at the end, the movie fails.One hell of a slooow movie I gave this 7 out of 10 because I liked the idea behind it. However, if you are looking for some Sci-Fi entertainment, this movie is not for you. It is very slow and I literally fell asleep several times while I was watching it. The visual effects are decent and the acting is good, but the lethargic plot development is counterbalancing all of this. If you are a patient person with a lot of spare time to waste, you may give Ex Machina a go. Soon after you put it on, you will find yourself fast-forwarding the majority of the scenes. Ex Machina is a 102 min. large screen movie that can easily fit in 30 minutes of TV time.Not Bad Sci-Fi Flick! This 2014 sci-fi film stars Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac. This tells about computer programmer, Caleb (Gleeson) who wins a contest where he's able to communicate with an android/robot, Ava (Vikander) and evaluate her. Isaac plays Nathan, a scientist who invites Caleb to his secluded home where he meets Ava. This isn't bad, the cast is good, there's neat effects and I like the music. The film has certain aspects of "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence," "Blade Runner" and "I, Robot" plus Gleeson and Isaac both star in "The Force Awakens" and "The Last Jedi." If you're into sci-fi flicks, check this one out.Cerebrally challenging and entrancing in its visual scope, Ex Machina is a powerful sci-fi showcase with spellbinding gravity As physicist Stephen Hawking once said, artificial intelligence could draw an end to mankind. That, however, is just a theory of the hazards when technology drastically surpasses human intelligence. This concept is solidly aligned in this psychological science- fiction thriller featuring Alex Garland, writer of '28 Days Later', in his directorial debut, a movie that takes artificial intelligence and places at the forefront of its story that defies against common tropes of its genre. With Garland's hefty directorial hand, this movie bears no place for heavy special-effects action-set pieces and instead, runs wild with thought-provoking ideas on human interaction with artificial intelligence and the dangers that rise when augmenting human smarts with cutting-edge technology. In this case, Garland doesn't hold back when challenging viewers at a cerebral level nor does he take sleek visual storytelling for granted. He just lets it unfold. This film follows Caleb (played by Domhall Gleeson), a 26-year old computer programmer of an internet company who is selected to participate in an experiment on artificial intelligence run by larger-than-life business CEO Nathan (played by Oscar Isaac). This experiment places him face-to-face with an intelligent humanoid Ava (played by Alicia Vikander) who bears a robotic body and a human face. While competing with her in a Turing Test in evaluate her human qualities, the experiment steadily grows more and more surreal when Ava reveals to much more human than both Caleb and Nathan imagine.  One thing to say for sure is that this film will not hold appeal for those craving for pulse-pounding, nor will it engage with viewers who lack the patience of a slow-paced narrative. The film moves very slow as it dedicates a great portion of its time building upon its characters and reeling in scientific ideas about artificial intelligence that dare to challenge the minds of its audience. Alex Garland is the mastermind behind the script which allows the characters grow in a manner that leaves viewers questioning each step they take and their psychology that grows when the experiment takes for surreal turn. Morals are tested, lives are at stake, and the fate of the characters are dedicated by the dubious choice of actions. The psychological aspect comes from the interaction between Caleb and Ava as they are monitored by Nathan who bears profoundly questionable intentions. By no means is there is a clear answer to his moral obligations. Is he a man trying to revolutionize technology for the good? Or is he a manipulator who is just a few step away from letting technology run amok for the sake of dominating humankind? Viewers will be divided on this. And Oscar Isaac brings a poignant delivery as the morally skeptical God- like engineer. But perhaps it may not beneath to compete with Alicia Vikander who's pose as the humanoid Ava dominates the atmosphere, which is solidly supported by the eerie music score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury. Domhall Gleeson is strong in his role, which bears a performance that sadly trumps over the bearing interest of his credulous character.  Ex Machina is an uncompromising science-fiction showcase succeeds not just on entertaining, but challenging audiences on an intellectual level while lending a hand on a powerful visual methodology. This movie sets a remarkable start on Alex Garland in the directorial world, and above all, demands the attention of those who bear the patience of its sophisticated plot and a wild delivery of scientific intelligence is prepared to throw at them.Intelligent Science Fiction This is a thought provoking film on the nature of artificial intelligence, humanity and ultimately truth itself. Fair warning this is a slow burn, character driven piece with little to no action. But if you like science fiction that is heavily grounded in science that raises interesting questions, this might be right up your alley. Overall I found it very engaging and it keeps you guessing.beguiling An excellent, intriguing, exciting hard sci fi film. not often these words go together. I can see why they worried about the release, but they got it badly wrong. This is a superb film. Its on the cutting edge, mildly, of both sci fi and film, but it carries it off well. Its probably the fact that it doesn't break new ground anywhere, but merely gently goes around, that makes it so edgy, but homely. script and characters are top notch, direction etc also very good. a bit plastic and lost in parts, but a film like this cant avoid that. Acting absolutely flawless and compelling. Recommended. PeteNot good. After saw this movie i think about other film Blade Runner .Blade Runner Is Masterpiece Best Movie About Artificial Intelligence . In Blade Runner You Can See What Is Consequences If Human Make A Robot We See Everything &amp; Feel Everything .Like Hope,Freedom,Evolution, Obviously The Final Scene Of Blade Runner Is Remarkable. But Ex Machina Can,t Say Anything It,s Completely Backward . If Blade Runner is 9 Ex Machina Is 1 . Of Curse I Think 1 Is Very Good For This Film &amp; I Can,t Believe What Movies Going To Oscar To Name Of Best Picture Every Year Academy Work Worst . This Movie Don,t Have Any Acting , Directing,Writing,Cinematography,Score &amp; Any New Idea, So What Is That? In 2001 We Saw Artificial Intelligence The Movie Can Say Something , We Can See The Little David Have Hope To see Her Mother ,HOPE, He Wish To Be Real Human ,WISH, And... But Ex Machina Is Really Have Nothing To Say Nothing.A Thrilling AI movie This is a thrilling AI movie. It has good ideas in it. Deception, manipulation of AI, are definitely over Turing test. But, I have to admit that they're putting too much meaning to one programmer, even if he's a genius. This is a top-secret project, probably nobody knows about it and it seems like a 26-year old man wrote all the logic behind. Come one guys :) Apart from it, it's really worth watching.Pleasantly Surprised Interesting film to say the least. I held off watching this for a while but ended up jumping in. It has a very slow start but once it starts to kick up a few notches you'll begin to feel for the characters. This film surprised me by but I ended up loving it. I definitely recommend giving this one a watch.I wish I had time to see another movie Do not allow the Oscars to deceive you Best Achievement in Visual Effects؟OK. What about the director? What about the actor's choice? What about the beginning and the end? Or, should Oscar be the worst film of the century. Have you ever been angry after watching a movie? See this movie. Then commit suicide...May need to watch it again... I'm not sure if I liked the movie. I may need to watch it again to decide. My husband straight up didn't like it. I can't decide. It may be too existential for me...or IT. However, the scenery is nice, the actors are good and the house amazing. It is an interesting concept. It does keep you guessing, and it isn't easy to figure out. I am just saying things to fill up space.Excellent film! a Sci-Fi classic I don't usually like or watch Sci-Fi movies, for many reasons; but this one was really worth it, every minute of it. This film is excellent. Artificial Intelligence is something that many hope it occurs, it has also become an arguable topic; and here they show us the interaction of a machine that has human attributes with a human. The whole concept and difference of what make a machine human or not. The special effects amazed me, they look very genuine, and everything related to the Sci-Fi part with imagination it looks believable, and that what I liked. It takes place in a house in the woods, so having, and first I must describe how amazing the takes of the nature are. Its a nice and pleasant contrast of the nature that hopefully it has and will always be there and something so advanced as Artificial Intelligence. This movie talks about the past, a little of the present, and the future. It talks about many subjects, this movie is about the everything. Production was incredible, and i could not ask for anything else. The performances by the three main characters are very subtle and nice, each one of them has its own persona, it shows very different people, and that is vital for interaction within characters in the story. This is the first movie that Alex Garland directs, and for me it did a wonderful job, because this movie is beyond amazing, it should be classic of Science Fiction that must live forever. And maybe in the future when they develop Artificial Intelligence in a human-like form, and they look back at a movie like this, with the expectations or at least the view that humanity used to have with A.I. 9.7/10Difficult for me to not like this film, but also to really love it "Ex Machina" is a British English-language film from 2014 and at this point probably the most known work by writer and director Alex Garland. This one is from 2014 and in 2 more years it will have its 5th anniversary, perhaps less if you read this review at a later point in time. Anyway, for me this film looked pretty promising because I like Gleeson, I really like Vikander and I love Isaac, so the three key players here (and it really is a 3-man show from start to finish) made me truly curious about it. Sadly, science fiction is not my favorite genre at all, which on the other hand decreased my interest in this 105-minute film again. And it turned out as expected eventually: I liked the performances, but story-wise I wasn't a 100% on board, but still (maybe also because of the actors) I liked it more than I usually like Sci-Fi films. Gleeson did what he had to do, even if he has not convinced me here as much as in other films that he may be lead actor material. Isaac is really good, also nice very different looks for once, and the way he portrays the character you never know if he is a man broken from his addictions and intelligence or really the man in control every second of the way. As we find out eventually, it is something in-between. And Vikander displays one of the most desirable forms of artificial intelligence that you will ever see in a film, perhaps recently only topped by Scarlett Johansson in "Her" and I must say I also preferred that movie over this one here. But that should not say by any means that "Ex Machina" isn't a good watch. It certainly succeeds in his own right and delivers a convincing story with strong performances from start to (almost) finish. I write "almost" because honestly the very ending with the helicopter scene is something that I did not like too much. But until then, it is really all good. There are some tense moments, like the power outage scenes, the sessions in general, the Isaac-focused scenes like the one where he tells Gleeson's character about the camera that relies on batteries. So if you enjoy Sci-Fi a bit more than I do, then I would not be surprised if you consider this one of the best films of the movie year 2014. Like the Academy did as well when they surprisingly honored this movie with a Best Visual Effects Oscar and Garland also scored a nomination for his writing. And it was an absolute career year for Vikander of course, who received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance here and won for another movie at the Oscars as well. Back to this film here, it is tense, atmospheric and also a pretty nice thriller that elaborates interestingly on power (not the electronic approach) and control and with the relationship between the two male protagonists you can also say it is a thriller movie focusing on interhuman relationships. You probably wanna check it out. Thumbs up from me.Thought provoking but too evasive The writing started out good. The atmosphere of morbidity and surrealism was pretty well conveyed. The 'ominous ambiance', as it keeps appearing in the subtitle column, played a major role in establishing this undertone. The setting was pretty classic sci-fi. A 'Mozart' level brilliant CEO, who lived in a secluded deep mountain in a luxurious mansion like Falling Water by Frank Lloyd Wright, with a spark of a whim invited a mediocre programmer to witness his revolutionary AI experiment. It should have been dreamy, exciting and adventurous at the beginning, then taking a steep turn to be shocking and pathological when the dark secrets of the scenic set-up was unveiled. But it didn't quite get there before the film quit this story scheme and irritatingly settle on the morbid atmosphere that too impatiently burst out. Domhnall Gleeson could't curb his realization that the film was going to slide towards the horror genre, therefore we as audience are painfully aware that he didn't make an effort to try to appear human at all. He was reticent and hesitant way beyond necessary, his untimely suspenses was not a symptom of social awkwardness, but a sign of laziness in the actor's part, trying to shift the burden of major emotional breakthroughs onto Nathan's shoulder. I kept observing him closely, trying to make out his personalities from his pitifully scarce actions and speeches, but couldn't really. His unsuccessful attempt to be transparent made him even more obtrusive in the story plot. I wonder why his sporadic silence was not edited out. Alicia Vikander was the reason I attempted to try the film, and she didn't flunk my expectation. Her acting was very natural and fluent. Ava's girlish expression in her floral dress was absolutely adorable. When she ascended the stairs in Nathan's mansion to 'the free world', her smile was the purest child-like pleasure of exploring the world. Ava's vindictive condescension after the knife was immersed in Nathan's belly was also very satisfying to watch. But of course she wasn't the perfect Hepburn-ish heroine, since she manipulated Caleb's affection, Kyoto's trust, and used them to murder her creator. Her sociopathy steered the story away from the moral advantages or disadvantages of AI. She was the character holding the helm and made sure this outlandish story didn't turn out to be another moral lesson about an invention we hadn't made yet.  And of course I have to comment on the Asian factors that were there just to be exotic and exciting. The salmon, the sex toy Asian girl Kyoko, Jade in the closet whose skin Ava was wearing, provided a seamlessly perfect ethnic backdrop for the white characters' story. Kyoko wasn't given a single line, and Jade, who banged against the wall until she fell apart, just proved another horrendous crisis for the white cast to face. The Japanese factors were exploited and pickled in their own miserable silences, much resembling a cinematic colony. This accusation could have been shunned if Ava was played by an Asian actress, but I guess an Asian protagonist is still too progressive an idea in the filmmaking world. It would have stung less if not for the abnormally small cast and very isolated stage, which categorized the film vaguely as an art film, and lifted our standards for sophistication of ideas encompassed. The writing was comparatively good for a sci-fi film like this. Acting possessed more sensibility and thoughtfulness than an average commercial film. But I think we can unanimously decide that this isn't a classic.film is great but has a mistake at the end It shows that Caleb hacked the security system to open the door at the time of power failure. At the end when Eva left him at the facility he tried to access the computer and the power has gone again. it shows that he is trapped inside by showing that he is trying to break the door with a chair, which he don't have to because he has already hacked the system to open all doors at the time of power failure and the door is suppose to openHigh-style fills in the gaps that substance leaves behind. But those gaps are smaller than in same-ish movies I've seen before. Stream-of-consciousness just having finished the film: Ex Machina has beautiful cinematography and/or high-end cameras, but that doesn't make a film. I want a story that's true and well-told, and characters that are real reflections of humanity (and other beings). This movie has the latter, with people (especially the main character) that I definitely saw in people of real life, including myself. And if I were my so much more self-absorbed self of 10-15 years ago, I would've identified with Caleb (main character) even more. And the utterly nouveaux-modern-next-generation-techy feel of it all (think Shattered Glass + Goodwill Hunting characters and youthful pride, with whatever newest tech and beautiful and maybe stark-cold CGI as a visual basis) is alright, cool, but where's the integrity? My main issues are with Ava--the A.I.--and Caleb--the good boy thrown into the situation. What are the moviemaker(s) trying to say here? Sexuality can just be programmed into software? And also attraction can? And friendship? And that an incredibly smart A.I. would trust the first man she meets that isn't her creator? And all within a week? Even putting all that aside, I see a suturing of elements in the characters. I can't explain it, it would seem. I am just not being given the words. But scene to scene as I watched, I saw people embodying things that seemed contrary to who they were introduced to be. Well, maybe I'm wrong and that was the whole point of the movie. Because I admit that possibility, and because of the style, it gets a 7 instead of 5 or 6. Not that those numbers really matter. I'd recommend it for all but the most thinky evenings.Awkward Lines As a computer science student surrounded by AI discourse, I find some of the dialogue, particularly between Nathan and Caleb, somewhat cliché, pretentious and awkward. The story line has its twists, but is a bit bland. Yet the acting and visual effects are indeed exceptional. I wouldn't recommend to someone with training in this field, but it's a good gateway to AI and some hot topics in this field.Majestic This film certainly is a bit much to review in anything short of a book. The cover reveals little and you'd be mistaken to only expect yet another "Science Fiction about an AI". It is much more than that. According to "the plot" it is about a programmer who performs an advanced sort of Turing test onto an AI, Ava. This is where intimate play heads off into a world of subtleties and mind plays, brilliantly enacted by every one involved. It is beautiful. The Turing test is a milestone in science mind, one invented by Alan Turing - a forefather of modern computers. The original Turing test is performed w/o visuals. An AI and a human merely chat with a proband, who then tries to discern what's the AI and what's the human. Basically the AI is supposed to fool the proband into considering it human. It requires the AI to exert an awareness of the proband's perception of the AI itself, so it can fool him.  Thing is: Turing was gay. He was subsequently charged for "perversion" and ultimately killed himself with a poisoned apple - which is why the once rainbow coloured apple has been read as apple's ode to Turing. Anyway: In the original text Turing first describes the test done by a man and a woman, both pretending to be women, as a "game", tested in chat by a proband who's supposed to figure out who is the woman. The ability of the man to pretend to be a woman is then supposed to test the presence of intelligence. It does not test a given uptake on intelligence but rather defines intelligence. Fault me if you will yet I dare claim the most famous test for the intelligence of an AI is inherently sexual from the start. It is not invented with only an AI in mind. Alex Garland apparently knows that. His film also does not only have an AI in mind and rightly so: We hardly know what "AI" is supposed to mean after all. That is the centerpiece the film revolves around. Love and perceiving how the other perceives us, empathy if you will, cannot be used as a tool in a strictly scientific test - because we introduce a "tool" we do not understand any more than the thing tested. Is there any purpose in this test? Or in creating an AI for that matter? It transcends all purpose, as it is more of a quest to find our own purpose rather than creating a tool for a specific task or role. The topic is much greater than people think. There are no clear cut answers. This film is about AI. This film is about love. This film is about cages and their significance for love, intimacy, roles and purpose. This film is about the internet, google and the privacy within our heads. This film is about art. This film is about consciousness in every meaning of the term. This film is about mankind's blind flight into an unknown future. This film is about the meaning of life and our inability to ever grasp it in certainty. All of that is true. None of that holds a grasp on its elusive theme. A theme that may seal or unseal mankind's fate found it's worthy expression in this masterpiece. Chapeau!telling of humanity What does it mean to be human? Pretty much all of created art, whether that be on-screen or on-page or on-pedestal narrative, is an exploration of this question. Why this phenomenon occurs is simple. We human beings have enough sentience and consciousness to have self-awareness and the ability to form our own thoughts. In the film Ex Machina we see what happens when true artificial intelligence is born. The humanoid robot Ava is painfully aware of who she is, a created sentient being kept within a confined chamber, a fellow entity of consciousness being prevented from seeing the outside world. Like we humans, she tries to answer this question of identity. It is only too natural what happens. To be frank, Ex Machina gave me the chills. To think, to realize the possibility of our own sentient selves creating another sentient self -- the questions that arise! Now personally, I acknowledge the existence of a divine entity (God) that is our Creator. Given this to be true, as we are created from a perfect being, we by very nature cannot be perfect. Thus, the notion of humans creating living beings that can only be even less perfectly designed is... unimaginable.  The human being can be thought of as the perfect computer given bodily form. Our brains, beginning from inception, adapt to new situations and ideas and thus shift and change accordingly. Our memory banks grow gradually more dense over time. Our emotions are immensely complex. We have personalities. We continuously make decisions in the ongoing present, decisions that can be changed irrationally. It is, I believe, a Universal Law that anything created cannot surpass its creator. Ergo, a robot -- even if it has true AI -- cannot be more cerebrally complex than the human being. But what about Ava? Created by Man, given intelligence, tested by another Man for the supposed advancement of the human race's knowledge and technology. One glaring mistake I noticed in Nathan's execution of his Turing test was that he should treated Ava as a human being, although she isn't. If Ava were on par with humans, then like any normal human, she wouldn't like her situation -- being locked away from the outside world, being used as a mere test object for someone else's benefit. Of course, this raises questions like that of an AI's morality. Would a created AI be able to recognize good from evil in the same manner that we can? I give Ex Machina a 10 out of 10 for two reasons. One, for the superb handling of the intense Ava-human interactions. Two, for the myriad questions raised that are crucial, of the highest importance, for the sake of mankind. Looking at the "progress" we're making right now, I shudder to think what we will land ourselves into within the next fifty, hundred, two hundred years. Recall The Matrix. Robots with lesser intelligence are good, in that they facilitate necessary tasks like surgery and are especially useful because they are less prone to "human error." HOWEVER. Robots of higher intelligence, namely true AI, are not good. Why would they help us? If they become so advanced as to consider us, their creators, inferior beings -- just as we consider other animals lesser beings -- could they enslave us? (See the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.) In fact, as we humans are tainted by something called sentiment, we cannot make the most rational decisions in every situation. We are not Vulcans. Therefore, the robots, who ostensibly do not have such emotions to cloud their thoughts, will see us as all the more unneeded. Here is my plea to all you scientists, engineers, innovators of thought: For the good of mankind's future, DO NOT play God. Creation of non-living existence is perfectly fine. But creation of living, sentient, conscious existence is a faculty only allowed God. We will only reap the consequences.Not about A.I at all..... Spoilers Ex Machina isn't about A.I at all its about the growing power women have in society and the dynamic change and power struggle between men and women. Nathan represents the old school male who bullies and physically dominates women while Caleb is the more modern passive, caring, naïve, lonely Male who is desperately trying to find aN old fashioned woman without understanding that women have changed as well. Ava at first is very much an old fashioned port rail of women. Bullied and controlled by Nathan, but she takes advantage of Caleb's kindness in order to get something she's never had before which is control over her existence. Leaving Naïve Caleb heartbroken and alone because he thought that she truly liked and needed him. It's about old fashioned Male dominance over women and also about the growing dominance women have over modern, more passive men.It gets better 'Ex Machina' is one of those films where, upon watching the whole thing, I'm glad I stuck with it. It tells the – slightly slow-moving – tale of a young computer programmer who works for a huge, multinational tech company and is then apparently picked at random by his reclusive billionaire boss and asked to join him in his mountain retreat for 'special duties.' Of course that slightly sounds like he's got a case to sue for sexual harassment, but it's not like that. His Bill Gate-likes founder has only gone and created the first ever artificially intelligent robot/android/cyborg (call it what you will) and wants an independent source to witness this feat. Luckily, for our hero – Caleb – this artificial life form isn't the kind of muscle-bound cyborg who typically comes back in time to kill your mother. Instead, she – or 'Ava' – is more designed around the 'female form' (well most of her, anyway – there are still parts of her on show that are blatantly wires and circuit boards). Anyway, this makes their interaction a little more 'complicated' – if that's the right word to describe getting a crush on what is technically an iphone with eyes. So, will our hero fall head over heels for her, or declare her simply just a toaster who looks good in a mini-dress? The majority of the film is basically conversations between either Caleb and Ava or Caleb and his boss, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Now, there's nothing wrong with a film based mainly around dialogue. It does bring the characters and their motivations out and you really feel like you're getting to know them. However, I just found the first half of the movie a little slow. I 'got' the characters pretty early and it was clear to see that there was more going on here than meets the eye. Perhaps the film did too good a job in setting up the unsettling feeling as to what was going to come? I was basically dying for something to happen – or someone to die – whatever. But, like I said, when it all goes down it's worth the wait. The second half of the film changes from simply 'unsettling' to downright dark! Despite the film having little action, it does maintain a real '28 Days Later' feel. And probably for the reason that it was written by the same writer. The lingering shots and music make it possible that it's set somewhere in the same universe (assuming there's still some of the world left after the 'infected' had their way with it! Normally, like to mention one of the actors who stood out. I feel that I should say that Oscar Isaac gave a great performance, but I'm not entirely sure he does. One of my annoyances with the first half of the film came from him. I just felt he was so fundamentally unlikeable. Maybe that was supposed to be how he was, but when a character makes up basically one third of the cast and is so downright awful, it left it a bit hard to take. Still, despite all my minor gripes, I did enjoy the film (as I say, mainly the second half where I felt it sped up a bit!) and so if you're in the mood for something with no car chases or giant robots stomping through New York then give this one a go. It's got good performances and is more of a subtle thriller than Hollywood's average crop.Excellent Although Alex Garlands book "The Beach" did not translate well to film, it's still one of my favorite reads of all time - and he deserved this win! What a phenomenal movie. I'm blown away.An incredible masterpiece about human nature Domhnall Gleeson + Alicia Vikander + Isaac Vega exploded this amazing AI vs Human consciousness story with every changing personalities and behaviour. You sure as hell cannot watch this masterpiece only once!A Different Sort of Picture Ex Machina (2015)  *** 1/2 (out of 4)  A different sort of science fiction film, a programmer (Domhnall Gleeson) wins what is basically a lottery to go and spend a week with his company's owner (Oscar Isaac). The owner, Nathan, pretty much created a search engine but he's gone a step further by creating an artificial intelligent woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander) who the programmer is supposed to examine and question. EX MACHINA pretty much came out of nowhere and became a good hit across the world and I'm rather shocked that it did. Usually dumb science fiction movies with a lot of mindless actions are the ones that make money and not those that features very little to no action and instead just dialogue and thought. What really sets this film apart is the fact that it asks more questions than anything else and it expects the viewer to think about those questions and the impact that certain actions could have. The visual style of the film is quite impressive and it's certainly a very interesting film to just look at. The music score is quite haunting and perfectly captures the mood of the film. There's the terrific cinematography that pulls you into the setting. The special effects are also extremely impressive. I loved the set and the look of this compound but the special effects are the real star. If you didn't believe that you were really looking at and operating with real artificial intelligent creatures then the entire film just wouldn't have the same feeling. Then there are the performances, which are a major plus. Gleeson pretty much plays the role that is typically a nerd but the film never lowers the character to that simple term and instead makes him a very interesting person. Even the role of the billionaire played by Isaac isn't what you'd typically see and the actor brings a certainly coldness to the part. Vikander is flawless and steals the picture in her role. EX MACHINA certainly won't be a movie for everyone but it's good to think about the questions that it asks.Wearying EX MACHINA is one of those wearing philosophical science fiction movies all about concept and with barely any plot to bolster that concept. I prefer films the other way around, where interesting issues are explored via a good story. Here, we get two guys and a robot in a house, where the scriptwriter takes plenty of time to explore the subject of artificial intelligence. For any sci-fi fan watching, there are zero surprises here; everything plays out exactly as you'd expect, and it takes ages to get to that point. Oscar Isaac gives a reliable performance but the one-dimensional Domhnall Gleeson is miscast and Alicia Vikander unconvincing. Some decent CGI effects are the only thing this long-winded and slightly pretentious tale has going for it.great smaller sci-fi treat Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a computer programmer at the biggest internet company which has a search engine and Bluebook. He's brought to the remote compound of its owner Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Nathan gives him a week to perform a Turing test on his new AI in the form of Ava (Alicia Vikander). Domhnall Gleeson has to sell this if it's to work. Alicia Vikander is more than a hot girl which helps a lot. I find Oscar Isaac playing only one note. This led me to a wrong guess. The resolution is an interesting one and not necessarily my expected one. The concepts are really interesting and this indie has a great look. Ava is hypnotic. This is one of the best smaller sci-fi from Alex Garland who's usually a writer.Unsurprising in some ways, but still professionally and engagingly presented (SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS) A solid piece of sci-fi this, which benefits from jumping right into it from the get-go. The film opens with Caleb winning an employee lottery to go and work with the head of the company on his estate, and within minutes we are there, and down to a very focused film with only a few players. It works better for this, and the sci-fi benefits from being about ideas and people talking. The special effects are astonishing, but are more impressive for how they support the narrative rather than being the equivalent of a fireworks display (although that explains why this is one of the lowest grossing films to win the special effects Oscar). The ultimate destination is perhaps unsurprising, however the film unfolds well, allowing for the inevitable to occur but also dragging in other ideas too. It spells it all out a bit too much at the end, but it still works, so maybe it was necessary to do that. There is a palatable sense of tension across the film, as the character reveal more of themselves, and take their paths. Although we know where it is leading, the film keeps one engaged in the moment, so there is less time spent trying to guess the outcome. The effects are the headline perhaps, but the performances make it work. Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander are all strong in different ways, but it is their ensemble work that makes the film work. In the end the story has a familiar conclusion, and nothing it can do freshens that up; however it is still engaging and interesting stuff, thanks in no small part to some strong performances and very impressive effects.These types of films are always a nice surprise. This movie is a perfect example of what types of movies SHOULD be getting made and backed heavy financially. Instead its remake after remake, after reboot and so on and so forth. The cinematography is absolutely stunning from the nature shots (most time lapsed) the story with so much depth it continued to hold my complete attention from start to finish. Oscar Isaac's performance in this film made me reassess how much of an underrated actor he truly is. Along with being a "sci-fi" movie, it is not run on and relied on special effects that are more often than not way way over the top and almost always the backbone of any sci-fi movies nowadays. Yes the CGI is spectacular and used in a subtle fashion in this one but it is not overdone and crammed down your throat in every seen. (Yes I'm talking to you Michael Bay). Then to top of this stunning visual maze that is wrapped inside a riddle.. with the deep real life undertones embedded in this film, the brilliant dialog between all the characters involved, the ending itself will make you start to question the entire nucleus of the films subject matter and before you know it... you will be asking yourself "what would I have done if I were "Caleb".Ex Machina - Finally an "Ex" You Should Love I don't know how you could leave the theater without being impressed by Ex Machina. It's not quite "elite," but certainly is well constructed, acted, and has fantastic CGI effects. The movie follows a coder (Domhnall Gleeson) at what would best be described as search-engine-marketing giant Google, if business names could be freely used in movies. At the outset Gleeson's character wins a coding contest and gets to spend a week with the company's reclusive CEO (Oscar Isaac) in his research compound. He agrees to participate in a Turing Test, an experiment to test how realistic an artificial-intelligence (AI) being interacts with him. Gleeson's meetings with the beautiful, alluring AI being (Alicia Vikander) are the core of the movie. Much like the compound, these numbered events lead the audience through doorways into rooms that are always thought-provoking and grow more and more uncomfortable each time they meet in videoed-isolation. You won't find a bad performance among the actors, in fact it's the best performance to date for every one of the lead &amp; supporting roles. Most people will talk about Vikander's ability to seem "human-ly robotic," but Gleeson, Isaac &amp; even a Sonoyo Mizuno role with no spoken lines, are just as strong.  Ex Machina is one of the most technically impressive movies (acting, sound, f/x, cinematography, even set details) - especially when you consider it's Garland's directorial debut. If Garland didn't communicate with Kubrick's spirit before this movie, Stanley will be reaching out soon to congratulate the director. If you're trying to relate this movie to something more recent, Ex Machina has the "weirdness" of 2013's Under the Skin with a very different plot line and characters. Reflective movie people will love it; if this isn't you, find your movie-geek friend, go see it together &amp; plan for coffee after.This Movie About the Future Set Women Back About 500 Years Ah yes, nothing quite like a powerful man building anatomically correct, female droids and getting his jimmy wet with this bevy of bionic beauties ranging from blonde (is that a race?) to African to Asian. Between the incredibly smart, powerful man in tech with the body of a gym rat and Achilles heel of a lush; and the scrawny nerd who just wants the drunk one to admit he's a great coder; my brain was drowning in the urine of this pissing contest while the drunk nerd was drowning in metal vagina. I have no doubt many twelve year old boys probably grew pubes watching this movie, while the rest of us cringed at this nerd, male fantasy called a movie. If you've ever dreamed of raping chicks, but needing them to be robots so people don't judge your proclivity too severely, this is the movie of a lifetime for you! But wait! There's more! So when these women aren't letting the king of the castle really give it to 'em, they desperately need rescuing from his house. Yeah, robots need rescuing. I'll tell you what, I'm about to get one of those BB-8 Spheros and if any of you jerks come to my apartment and try to "rescue it", I will call the cops on you so fast for burglary. It's a robot; not a person. I mean, super gross this guy ejaculates inside of them and all, but Siri sprouting a chest does not make her an actual person at all. But you know those women, always needing saving! Even the robot ones! I'm still not done, by the way. It gets even worse. Then there's this whole thing where the main robot chick, who is way out of the league of the not drunk, hero nerd, uses her sexuality to manipulate him to free her. Again, you know, cos these robot concubines might be robots, but they are women, so they will obviously use their vagina to get out of situations they don't like. Even robot women! Of course, hero nerd is such a nice guy that he does this for robot woman. What does out-of-his-league robot woman do? You guessed it! She betrays him, effectively leaving him to starve to death (I assume he'll try to Beat Grylls it by drinking his own pee). Women! You just can't trust 'em! Amirite? Even when you build your own woman to have sex with/rape on the daily and nightly, they'll still stab you in the back bother literally and figuratively! Yes, if you're wondering, there's a scene where one of the robot concubines literally stabs drunk nerd in the back. The sci-fi component itself is 8th grade, stoner level at best with very little resting in plausible technology. The philosophies that usually blossom of sci-fi do not even exist here. At some point, they use a Bhagavad Gita quote (that they credit Oppenheimer with, of course, I'm not going to get into that much more), but they do not manage to come up with a single original thought. Pros: Kickass architecture and really pretty shots of Alaska. Cons: Literally everything else about this movie. I'm surprised it's rated so highly, though I'm seeing most of the the people writing such glowing reviews are... you guessed it... dudes! Recommended viewing: if you are a recovering alcoholic who feels like relapsing; a woman who was raped and feels like being triggered; an angry, white, male nerd who needs that extra push to rape and murder the chick who lives a couple doors over. This is probably the only time I'll ever write a review on IMDb, because I'm really shocked that it has a score over 4 let alone all these reviews raving about how great it is. No. This movie is terrible.Fascinating, Thoughtful, Somewhat Freaked Out I watched Ex Machina and became somewhat freaked out during the middle of it. Looking back on it, my overall emotion toward it is not a very happy one, but rather uneasy. In terms of rating, I would have trouble creating a movie with the same idea any better.  Someone said this movie was like a roller coaster, and just as soon as you approach what looks like a double loop, they slow you down and let you off. I would completely agree with this, in that the middle of the film where the plot is building momentum gets very intense. I found myself questioning how far are we, really, in today's world, towards creating such artificial intelligence.  Most of this movie is believable. I loved that about it. I didn't catch anything that seemed unreasonable. There were some parts that made me think "Wow this is so happening right now"!  I remember watching Bicentennial Man with a group of friends when it first came out. Ex Machina blows that out of the water and feels very 2015. Ex Machina is gorgeous, too. No one seems to mention how beautiful the film is. If you simply watch it for the beauty, you will be exhilarated with excitement and dream you were there (better yet, dream you actually live there!).  Oscaar Isaac does an amazing job at his role. I'm still blown away at the character development and solid performance on screen. I can't wait to see more roles from him! Can he get away from the bearded crazy short temper guy Nathan?The evolution of Science Fiction This kind of Sci-Fi is what I live for ! Thought provoking, it had me questioning my own morality and my future relevance in the evolutionary chain of life. With real life advances in robotics, 3D printing, the internet and advances in programming this Sci-Fi will be Sci-Fact in the not too distant future which the film really captures. The cast wasn't big but it wasn't really required either. The character diversity and development made the story solid and definitely worth watching several times again. Great set design and CGI gave the film believability that this could actually be occurring today in some secret location in the world. A remarkable film that I am keen to get my friends to watch and comment on the ideas it presents.Screenplay not overdone or filled with unnecessary nonsense. Beautifully photographed. Ex Machina is the best film about A.I. becoming self-aware that I have seen. I went in knowing that I would probably enjoy the film, based on Alex Garland's previous work and the actors involved. It was a creepy and futuristic subject that, if you really think about it, is a very realistic concept. The film serves as a warning of sorts. It tells us to be careful and not to let our egos get the best of us. Just because we CAN create something, does not mean that we should. The screenplay wasn't overdone or filled with unnecessary nonsense. Simply executed, beautifully photographed &amp; designed with great acting, perfect tone and a haunting score. See this now &amp; after you get home, read my feature about the viral marketing campaign and the original strategies they employed to promote it (ello.com/fromconcentrate).It's great to see Sci Fi coming back! I really didn't check up on what the outline was of this film other than seeing the Trailer for it in the theater. I took my girlfriend (She was a fan! Clock one up for Sci Fi!) to see it and was very pleasantly surprised to see how thought provoking and well made the film was. I remember drooling over the house location they shot at as a kid in "Architectural Digest" too! I am so glad to see quality Science Fiction film making a steady comeback again! I am a huge fan of Artificial Intelligence and Cyberpunk "genres" in film and print and this film is a great addition to both. I really look forward to the day a truly great dedicated Cyberpunk film comes out again as well. Congrats to the filmmakers of Ex Machina, and thank you for the great work!Foreseeable For an experienced movie fan, this movie was a beautifully composed bouquet of clichés. Without a doubt the camera work, and the composition of frames (in some of the cases) was really good, sometimes even great. But the story and the writing was a bit underwhelming. Since the scene where our "hero" won the "lottery" it was very suspicious. And the fact that the hole experiment was staged is so foreseeable that it really hurts... But once again... maybe I saw too many movies in this genre. The twist/twists at the end, can give the writer's a pat on the back... but even so the hype was bigger than the movie. The acting was fine, the ambiance, especially the sound was well done. It's watchable if you are not a Sci-fi fan, and it's even enjoyable if you haven't seen any movie regarding AI and android, and the rise of the machines...Worth Watching a Second Time Absolutely Brilliant! The spareness of the treatment is spot-on; it's been a long, long time since anyone has had the gumption to focus on the story and underlying thought currents like this, and I couldn't be happier. In fact I will be going to see this again, a thing I haven't had motivation to do in 20+ years. For the majority of the general audience they will be bored to death; for the audience that is willing to sit back, watch, and think this would be hard pressed to be better (and I' d be very happy to have a bevy of film makers try!). THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE ORIGIN AND CORE OF SCIENCE FICTION, which most have forgotten as they drown in shoot-em-up, amp-d up action scenes. Well Done!Poor story, only reasonable otherwise If I had realised this was by Alex Garland I would not have bothered watching. I remember reading his book the Beach years ago and thinking 'there's something not very nice about this'. At the time I wasn't sure what it was. But now having seen Ex Machina, I have the same feeling. That the story has been chosen simply to appeal to a large audience, in a rather manipulative, unthinking and unfeeling way. I don't normally write bad reviews - of anything. Preferring to focus on the positive. But I so dislike this I felt I had to write something to put people off wasting their time, or assimilating some of this 'nastiness'. In the case of Ex Machina I can just imagine Garland wondering what he would do for his next project, googling AI and quickly finding the AI Box Experiment. And rather than do the heart- and soul-searching work that would be necessary to produce anything original I imagine him quickly turning somebody else's idea into his next big proposal to present to the film studio. So an unoriginal idea, presented in a fairly pedestrian way. Lots of images derived from a young person's view of 'sexuality', made me also wonder if this film is rather prejudiced against women? It is reasonably paced but I found myself yawning a lot - not quite what I would expect from a good thriller. Domhnall Gleeson is OK, does a pretty good job.stunning and beautiful! I have been waiting for this movie for a while and the long wait has been totally worth it! Without giving too much spoilers, the movie is about the Turing Test performed by a millionaire researcher boss (Nathan) between one of his employee (Caleb) and his newly created 'female' android robot, called 'Ava'. Caleb was invited for this week- long experiment in Nathan's remote research facility. For the most part, the film revolves around a closed apartment with 3-4 major characters and with very few scenes of the outside world. The resulting claustrophobic atmosphere occupied by the omnipresent 'big brother' Nathan watching the interaction of the confused Caleb and the seductive, ever mysterious Ava makes a gripping viewing experience.  Right from the beginning when the human subject Caleb enters through the door of the apartment with the blue light ominously turning red in a somewhat foretelling fashion, there is a definite sense of uneasiness and paranoia throughout the film. There are appropriate philosophical aspects regarding how one should define intelligence or the meaning of one's emotional awareness or the foreshadowing discussion of technological singularity. Some viewers may find these philosophical conversations a bit boring, but they actually serve well to allow us have deeper glances into the character developments. Just to quote an example, Ava's wishful fanciness in watching flow of humans in a busy traffic crossing makes us slightly more curious about her. Later we come to know that this instinct of her has its roots in how 'she' has actually been created,- by studying countless human data obtained by every personal computers and mobile phones in the world.  There are some beautifully crafted moments like the Jackson Pollock painting scene, imagery in Ava's mind during the description of the thought experiment, her putting the clothes on for the first time or even the final shadow- scene. The director has equally balanced it with eeriness with scenes like Caleb's discovery of the other female androids, The look in Ava's eyes when the light goes off during the first session of the Turing Test, Kyoko's 'revelation', Ava's selection of dress and 'parts' or the chilling hint of a smile on an old android inside the closet. The chilling final twist, although have been subtly foretold in a few scenes is not something which is very obvious. The film is well supported by the acting ensemble. but, easily the top of the cast is Alicia Vikander, who excellently portrayed Ava, expressed all kinds of emotions,- from longing, love, hate, curiosity, to indifference, mostly through her eyes and she brought into the screen a 'realistic' Ava with her slow and slightly dragging feet movements as well.  There are a couple of ambiguous things which I feel the director might have thrown more hints into. For example, we do not know the true purpose of Kyoko. It is not completely clear whether she is just an android maid and a 'live' sex toy or is a new version of 'Ava' in making. More importantly, why does Caleb not feel any apparent pain when he cuts himself deeply and how the deep gushing wound seemingly healed itself or maybe he is also an android? These are things left to stretch the imagination of the viewers. But overall, in my opinion, Ex Machina makes a stunning directorial debut of Alex Garland. I will be expecting eagerly for his future projects.SPOILER Pygmalion remastered When an opportunity to make a movie about a subject that has found review in classical times presents itself, it would be marvellous to see a fresh perspective applied that defines our generation and psyche. Unfortunately I see a rehashing of the classical themes without too much challenge or interpretation. A simple reversal of genders would throw the whole balance of the idea and challenge reader and author alike, driving us to new conclusions and interpretations. As cinematically endearing as this movie is, with the final wall never being removed, it leaves question of human desire and manipulation clearly the traditional role of the sexually charged female. Where do we draw the line with that interaction? Why does the protagonist have to be male in this case. How much more interesting would a female perspective be. As much as this is a good movie it also it falls into the chauvinistic Hollywood genre where females are to blame for the fall of man. Can we be fooled or should we challenge the pre-concepts? Enjoy.A big disappointment You can judge the scale of my disappointment by the fact this is my first review here. The movie started strong and given the tension increase I was expecting a really nice outcome. But it turned into a shallow and alogical piece. Logic abandoned. Even Asimov's AI had a first unbreakable law that it couldn't hurt a human being - this should be the first thing to integrate as a rule in a AI, but hey our My Genius Creator just skips that, because it's cooler to build the AI without such clauses even though you intend to use it as a slave against its will. Come on! Nobody is that stupid, especially a genius who invents the first AI! Another very important thing to consider is the veracity of the whole development process which is presented as done by a SINGLE man, dude what, that's not even serious. What about the reason for the main antagonist to get drunk as dead every night, or is that how he invented the AI? Unbelievable and unrealistic the movie is a failure to me, sorry.Astonishing and thought-provoking. A future classic. I'm not normally moved to write reviews - many people much more knowledgeable than me can offer greater insight into the films we watch - but I'm compelled to at least try after having watched Ex-Machina last night. From the outset, I was utterly hooked. This is a nuanced, delicately ominous portrayal of one possible future that mankind may face. Some may think the film suffers from a plodding pace at times, but I viewed it as a slow-burner without the in-your-face bells and whistles that so often plague Sci-Fi. There was, to me at least, a faint impression of the foreboding and solitude that we see in The Shining, with long panning silent views of starkly beautiful vistas, the gently increasing sense of dread and the occasional corridor shot. The film works absolutely wonderfully with it's pared-down cast of just four main characters. Ava is so gently subtle, Nathan, although he tries to hide it behind a buddy exterior, smugly fancies himself as a god of sorts, Caleb grows quickly over the space of a couple of days and Kyoko has her own pivotal role. All in all this film skilfully builds paranoia upon fear, isolation upon violence to reach it's crescendo. A superb film, I hope in the future this is seen to be the classic I believe it is. I won't be happy until I get to see it again on the big screen.Its pronounced Makina not Machine-ah Yeah its a good film but to be honest the whole AI bit of it isn't what interested me. Although I'm not sure that is what was supposed to be most interesting about the film. Yes it does raise the now old question about AI and whether it is a good decision to create it. Most films about the subject do seem to indicate that it is the precursor to the end of humanity as we know it as does this film in a less scarier and less imminent way...... anyway, Its Oscar Isaac's, genius, reclusive, insane????, brilliant and often scary character that made this film a great watch for me. Domhnall Gleeson's character could have been there to try a new secret sauce for a fast food company and as long as Isaac was there looming about the house telling him about how important it was to keep the secret sauce a secret and explaining the intricacies of marketing fast food to the world and all that stuff I would probably still enjoy the film. As long as there was a dance sequence involving Isaac and some girl in a burger costume or something of course. Yes this review is weird and you should discount it at your nearest convenience. Its a good film though, watch it.Should we trust in artificial intelligence? When I started to watch the movie the movie, at first I thought that it would be another dynamic sci-fi action, but step by step I found out that the authors have made a very slow and tense drama movie on robots and artificial intelligence. The movie is about a young scientist (Domnhall Gleeson), who is hired by a billionaire (Oscar Isaac) to go to his house which is constructed among the woods and rocks to examine his invention - a female robot with artificial intelligence (Alicia Vikander). The main reason of the examination is the fact that a big proportion of human feelings and passion is injected into this robot and the latter can is capable of feeling and discussing matters like a human being. I don't wanna write something about the script as there are no harsh or abrupt events and the whole movie is a discussion around the logics and feelings, joy and disappointment. The movie is very stylish and beautiful, brilliant nature, unique scenes, bright colors. Acting is good, for me it is not a movie, that demands brilliant acting skills. Of course, there are some aspects that could be done in different way, for example the end of the movie, which was quite predictable for me. The whole movie is accompanied by a dull and tedious sound which keeps the watcher in tension, waiting for something critical.Robotic Kubrick Alex Garland (screenwriter of 28 Days Later &amp; Sunshine) delivers a tremendous and thought-provoking story with great performances from (the always great) Oscar Isaac, (the young in everything) Domhnall Gleeson, and (the wonderful) Alicia Vikander. The film is a slow burner, but when it does burn, damn! It burns bright! This film is electrifying, it's terrifying, and yet says so much about where we are heading in terms of existence and technology.  Visually, it is stunning, with gorgeous cinematography and great use of symmetry (Kubrick style), the film is beautiful to watch, and coupled with the engaging narrative, this film really does draw you in and takes you to places that leave you gasping.  It has the feel of a Danny Boyle movie, but yet Garland has placed his own stamp upon this film, even if he is slightly paying homage to his precious working relationship with Boyle.  This film will take you in and leave you thinking "what the hell happened there?" This film IS a must! 5/5 www.backtothebradshaw.wordpress.comPure bliss for sci-fi geeks Believe all the rave reviews. Like "Interstellar", this movie will bore to tears people who are not fascinated with speculative scientific thought &amp; extrapolation i.e. fiction. Alex Garland wrote one of my favorite movies of the century, "Never Let Me Go", &amp; now has written &amp; directed this movie which already rates high on that list. It is chilling &amp; extremely thought provoking with outstanding performances by the 3 leads + a supporting role that seems to come out of nowhere. This movie does a beautiful job at turning up the heat while it thaws out. It has a very graceful pace that tightens around your throat until it leaves you breathless &amp; dizzy. Some movies wear their heart on their sleeves. This movie wear it brain on its sleeve. It is the year's first great movie.  (Since this movie doesn't feature a disabled English subject serving the Queen it chances for any Oscar consideration is absolutely zero.)Best sci-fi movie after District 9 This is a MUST SEE film and I hope that this review can be useful to you. I'll say little about cinematography, acting and other technical stuff, which are very good, with no huge budget (AFAIK, it's about 15 million $). That's not the reason why I gave a 10/10 to this film. I gave it the maximum because it is revolutionary. Just like District 9 changed the way I used to see aliens in the movies, Ex Machina changed my vision of AI in the movies. BTW, EM is the opposite of Spielberg's AI, which is a very naive concept automaton just like ET was a naive concept of alien. There have been many AI based movie plots lately. Maybe Hawking's remark about the fear of real artificial intelligence roused the intellectual and the entertainment world. Ava is a machine just like we are hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. From a structural point of view there's small differences between mammals. If alien scientists come and analyze our world, how would they understand the difference between a human and a chimpanzee? Ava is smarter than her creator, who never expected to be beaten by the machine who was so super to use the other male character for her purpose: freedom.  Excellent movie 10/10The distortion of distinctions !!! There have been many films made by many well known directors over the years that deal with the whole concept and phenomenon of 'Artificial Intelligence' or AI. Some are great, some are not so good. Ex Machina written and directed by first time director Alex Garland is another film that can be added to that list and it deserves all the acclaim that it has received from the critics' circles.  Ex Machina basically is a very personal and intimate film involving very few actors. But the ambitious nature of the script is apparent by analysing what the limited characters in the film stand for and represent. The script has so much to say and it is so layered and directed so well, that it is tough to believe that this is Garland's first film. There are a variety of themes that are at play. Garland talks about the new Godlike status that technology and technological entrepreneurs have obtained in this day and age. They throw technology at us and the general population gets hooked. But Garland in a way is of the opinion that maybe it's not the technology that gets tested by people, but it is the other way round. It is the general population that gets treated like test subjects for technological experiments in this 21st century market.  Alex Garland challenges the viewer to put him/herself in the Robot Ava's shoes and decide whether 'her' actions are truly mechanical and completely devoid of humanity or whether they are not very different from the actions of us humans without really giving an answer and hence he makes a comment about how human beings may be slowly losing the humanity which separates them from other living beings. But the great thing is, he manages to convey these lofty messages without ever being preachy or sentimental. The film has a very understated and hypnotic quality about it that intrigued me. The film's theme of the distortion of distinctions between man and machine reminded me very much of Blade Runner and that too in the best way possible. There are also themes of anti-establishment and subtle elements of feminism that are inherent in the narrative.  The acting is stupendous from all the three main characters involved. Domhnall Gleeson efficiently portrays the naive and idealistic nature of his character Caleb who has the best intentions but who is also oblivious of the game being played at his expense. Alicia Vikander plays the robot 'Ava' which is being tested for Artificial Intelligence. Playing a robot can be very challenging. Sometimes the intentionally mechanical and impassive nature of the character can lead to the performance being boring or sometimes even laughable. But Vikander uses the right amount of subtlety with her facial gestures and mixes them with the general robotic gestures and gives a very convincing performance. But for me the best performance in the film comes from Oscar Isaac who plays the mysterious Nathan. He looks muscular and exudes this masculine aura which makes him intimidating . His character never allows you to make your mind up about him till the ultimate denouement.  Ex Machina is a great debut film from Alex Garland. It is thematically complex and deserves multiple viewings and I am sure that more elements of the screenplay will become perceivable to me when I'll watch it again. I really don't have anything negative to say about it. Ex Machina is an artistic, multi-layered sci-fi classic.A modern day science fiction classic The intensity of the story is matched only by its originality. This is one of the great science-fiction movies. The movie works because its premise is entirely plausible. The test subject is not the robot, it is the human. Even more, that the human gets caught up in the experiment and loses total objectivity is entirely believable. Emotions do influence perception. Even though the human cognitively understands that the female is a machine, he cannot help but relate to her as a human. The movie is also a take off on the Frankenstein theme, that one should not try to tamper with nature, which now includes artificial intelligence. With AI comes feelings and if an machine is invested with feelings, then they become dangerous, precisely because it is a machine. Oscar Isaac is outstanding as the reclusive multi-billionaire who is delving into areas of research that are putting him and all of humanity at risk. What is even more chilling is that the robot is as attractive as she is cunning, and so will be almost impossible to detect. Hence, the need for Blade Runners, but that's another movie.
Let down by poor script, confused tone By the third time a helicopter flew into view, I was exhausted, and dreaded the prospect of yet another interminable and unconvincingly rendered crash scene.  The plot was an unappealing mess of recycled ideas. This film brings us yet another revenge story about someone who shares history with Bond but has since turned evil. That was precisely the plot of the last movie - and rather like the last three Star Trek films, most Batman films, the Superman reboot, this year's Avengers, etc. Like last time, the stakes are raised by nebulous and non- frightening, yet world threatening (so we are told, but never shown) computer network technology.  The film once again focuses on the question: "are spies still relevant?" I don't find that to be an interesting premise for a Bond film. Why not just assume that the answer is 'yes' and make a fun and smart action movie with a heart? Casino Royale nailed this. If you really must cover the question of whether your main character is relevant, then at least deal with it once and accept the answer! In Skyfall we learned that you still want a man in the field. In this movie, we learn that you still want a man in the field (and, in case anyone was still not getting it, poor Ralph Fiennes in his role as a flaccid M spells it out literally). While I liked both actors involved, I didn't care for the romance - the movie desperately wants to build it up to be something more than an just another Bond girl. That is an admirable idea, but since the result pales in comparison to the stellar romance in Casino Royale, it seems totally unconvincing when Bond sacrifices his entire career for her at the end. Holy moly - Bond settles down? For THIS girl? What an ending to Craig's character arc that started with Vesper's death (so much more meaningful than anything in any of the other Craig Bond films). Bam, all his emotional problems are solved, because he met a hot blonde. "I've got something better to do than all this!" (throws gun away, gets into car with whatshername). Gee, great ending. All the interesting plot developments from Casino Royale and (and even Quantum of Solace to some extent), such as Bond's emotional state after losing Vesper and the Quantum organization, are chucked out the window. Skyfall discarded Quantum in favor of a good idea (Bond/M son/mother relationship) and a bad one ("is MI6 still relevant?"). Now, Quantum is back... Kinda. This time, it forms no threat at all - you see, it turns out this OTHER organization that THIS movie is about is even moar powerfuller. And it was really this other, super duper evil organization all along. Muahaha! That is a tiresome plot twist if ever I've seen one. It completely missed the mark for me; it's weak to try and make your own plot look better by retroactively stating that all villains of the previous movies were really just pawns in this guy's game of chess. And that's not the only aspect of Bond history that is severely diminished by this film. In Skyfall, we learned about Bond's youth, spent with an old Scottish dude named McAngus. I think. And, of course, his relationship with M. This time, however, it turns out that Bond actually grew up in the Bavarian Alps with a couple of yodeling Germans named Oberhausen. Errr? Am I the only one confused here? (Possibly.) Bond turns out to have a sort of surrogate brother, who is very blond, very German, and very jealous. Oh and he also happens to be a supervillain, with an enormous army, who somehow managed to stay absolutely hidden for all these years. There is a powerful and compelling reason for his having all these skills and resources: it's convenient for the plot. And so, all previous Bond movies are reduced to one large scam operation, a plan by an Alpine superhero that makes absolutely no sense, in a failed attempt to give this movie a great villain. Christoph Waltz is a joy to watch, but he is never allowed to be a real threat. The man gets little to work with, as did Javier Bardem in the last one - criminally underused, awesome actors. The film's tone was confusing. There is one gruesomely violent scene involving eyeballs - I don't enjoy seeing such aggressive violence, although here I seem to be in a vanishingly small minority. Call me old fashioned, but I was always happy that Bond films used polite violence: gentle fist fights until one guy faints, or perhaps someone shoots a gun and somewhere else, far away, someone falls to the floor. Putting my personal feelings aside, it was jarring to have this scene be followed up by a cartoonish fist fight on a train, after which the eye-ripping guy is yanked out of a train by a rope, but not before realizing his predicament like Wile E. Coyote hanging over the ravine and saying "shit!". Is this a corny spy movie with train fights a la Bond vs Jaws? Where Bond leisurely glides a crashing airplane around for a few minutes and then humorously lands precisely on top of the bad guy's car? Or is it a somber drama about an aging man's career in a time when nobody knows whether spies are still relevant? Or does it want to be a raw, violent gangster film like Goodfellas, reveling in the sight of bad guys proving their credentials by maiming others? Finally, I found the camera work jarring in many action scenes - shaky cam, etc. This may have been (partly) due to my sitting in the fourth row, though.Ronald Bond This movie is somewhat watchable if you manage to convince yourself that the hero is Ronald Bond, brother of the more famous and successful James Bond. Ronald of course, unlike his brother, is not the suave charmer and rascal type, but has more of a polish wrestler look and demeanor. This makes for some light comedy when Ronald is shown to be one of the few men that can't look smart and elegant wearing a suit, which incidentally only make him look more silly and distinctly out of place. Ronald also has to rely on fools luck more than skill and intelligence to save his ill conceived ways of handling things. At the start of the movie for instance, he manages to raze two entire blocks of houses whilst trying to perform the simple task of taking out a bad guy with a snipers rifle. Not only that, but he also manages to miss the intended target. He then proceeds to chase said villain into a helicopter that takes off and flies around over a huge crowd of people. Unlike his brother James, who would simply have disposed of the bad guy and then asked the pilot to land at some convenient location, Ronald finds it a good idea to also try and take out the pilot at the same time although should he succeed, the heli would undoubtedly crash into the crowd. Fools luck saves him this time though. We get another show of his ineptness later on when he escapes out of a window. Since the bad guys chasing him would have no option but to follow him the same route, his brother would undoubtedly just turned around, wait for them to exit and them pick them off one by one with his Beretta. Ronald here of course just continues running and tries to speed off in his car resulting in a car chase. Fortunately someone must have called in a bomb threat because the city, Rome, is almost completely devoid of people. I know this, because I have been in Rome, and there's people and cars everywhere. Later on when a woman he has, like only an idiot can, fallen in love with at first site gets kidnapped by bad guys he proceeds to go after them in an aeroplane. His brother would of course just kept his distance, landed close to where the kidnappers cars stopped, and then snuck over to take care of business. Not so Ronald, he proceeds to attack them with the plane itself, seemingly without a plan. After failing miserably, as predicted, the plane crashes through a wood. Sheer luck however, not skill, eventually makes it so that he ends up at the same place as the baddies, most of them disposing of themselves in a crash, and thus lets him save the girl. Ronalds plan for the end game has to be seen to be believed. After finding out somehow where the bad guy has his bad guy compound, Ronalds plan is simple; even though the villain knows his name, what he looks like and who he is, he will just go there, waltz right in, hope to be taken to the villain, tell him that he has come to kill him, and then do so. That's it, that's the whole plan. For some reason bringing a girl along also seems like a good idea. The villain first does the obvious to thwart this "plan": send someone to dispose of this idiot en route. When this fails (on a train, incidentally also most likely bomb threatened, because like Rome before it, it's empty) this villain changes his mind for some reason, and instead of shooting the fool right in the face on sight when he arrives, proceeds to house him, give him a guided tour of his lair and then hit him over the head and torture him for a while whilst revealing some back story so ridiculous it must have had the writers rolling on the floor with laughter. One can't help wonder what Ronalds contingency plan was throughout all this.  The plot on it's whole is incomprehensible and stupid, apparently all the intelligence agencies in the world are about to pool into one giant data base that NONE of all the experts that thus must have been involved, with all their vast resources, have managed to find out is controlled by the bad guy. Incidentally, on the plus side, the bad guy also turns out to be an idiot who makes it only through luck. (watch how he miraculously survives not only the explosion of a hand grenade type watch (don't ask) thrown at him, but also the explosion of his whole bad guy hideout. (no explanation is of course given as to how he managed this) There's a fun sequence near the end that can only work if we assume that said bad guy spent some time printing out Ronald Bonds passport photo, as well as those of various friends and colleagues of his, and spent what must have been a considerable amount of time walking around a building taping these up presumable to unnerve Ronald when he arrives there. He also apparently went out to buy a spray can so the could spray "Bond" and an arrow on the wall. The latter implies that his plan actually hinged on the certainty that Bond would escape from the henchmen that captured him earlier on. There is however nothing that shows that the henchmen were intended to let him go so that he could reach this target, so why anyone would bother with the printing, spraying and taping when the odds of Ronald Bond actually getting there are extremely slim, is any ones guess. All great fun though but watching James Bonds brother clown and clumsy his way through an adventure like this makes one long for an actual James Bond movie, it has been too long!Mediocre and overbudgeted ! Despite an initial action scene full of CGI that you can also experience in the trailer, this movie hasn't got too much to offer. The main problem is the bad script and dialogs and the pretentious style which tries to keep the tradition of older Bond films incorporating some not-so-witty and cliché humor and ludicrous action sequences with nothing new to offer. Planes, helicopters, cars...Well we've seen it all before and in much better executions. Also Blofeld (or should I say BLOWfeld), despite the fact he is the King of all previous villains, seems quite harmless. Casino Royale (2006) is far more entertaining (I've watched it again recently) and engaging. Spectre is "Meh!" in almost every department including (unfortunately) the ladies. Thomas Newman who serves as the composer of the film, is proved to be a bad decision too. At the beginning he tries to revive the good-old 007 theme in almost every scene and the outcome is sub-par to say the least. Later he replaces the music with the same note again and again (da-da-da-da-da-da-da). David Arnold did a great job in C.R. and should have been the composer in this too (although I doubt that he could save this movie). And what's the deal with this lame song? Unsuitable for a Bond movie or any movie out there. Same goes for the same-o same-o intro sequence. The combination of these 2 makes it look like it was made by Liberace. Overall: The whole movie is pale like the Pale King it mentions.Save your money this is a rental (if you must see it) Before I unload my barrage of critique against this film I would like to first state something. Whenever I watch a movie, and I have so many issues with it, I will take a step back and ask myself for what it is, is it at least a good action movie? The answer is no, it is not. Good things about the movie:  High production quality and some good visuals / The intro sequence before the helicopter **SPOILERS BELOW** -AVERT YOUR EYES!- Problems with the movie:  1) You kill a bad guy, bad guys organization wants to kill the wife cause she's a loose end, Bond prevents the assassins, she finds out Bond killed her husband, then... she sleeps with him immediately. What? Sure she didn't love her husband but with all the stuff going down and after a powerful organization sends 2 assassins they have time to take a break and get busy? (possibly Assassins come in pairs and more arrive only after 30 minutes enough time to shag)  2) WASTED TALENT. 2a) Christoph Waltz. Such a great actor, with a horrible script. At the beginning they make him out to be a bada$$ in the shadows requiring to whisper things to underlings who then announce it to the rest of the group at a meeting. But then he randomly talks on his own because he can, and even has time to say hello to Mr. Bond in the crowd just as Bond realizes he's been caught, and manages to escape bumbling security guards. They attempted to make Waltz' character this mastermind who I was never afraid of, and he wasn't that menacing. For the leader of one of the most powerful organizations his master plans came off weak and his ruthlessness tame. 2b) Dave Bautista. They used him pretty good with his introduction and a fight scene in the movie, but the car chase scene was horrible. Bond was essentially talking to moneypenny on the phone about bad guys rap sheets while Bautista's character was chasing him down in a car (but he was more following Bond then attempting to shoot him or run him off the road). At one point during the chase scene Bautista pulls up next to bond and is looking at Bond and their eyes meet up... and nothing happens Bond pulls ahead. Is this a love story between two men or is this a bada$$ car chase scene where the bad guy is trying run him off the road/pound him into the ground?  3) This film has max level cheese that at times I could have sworn this movie was written by Bollywood writers. I don't mind a decent amount of cheese, but if you're piling it on and the expiry date shows 10 years ago there's a problem. 3a) Helicopter intro Scene 3b) save the girl or building blows up scene 3c) Bonds helicopter chasing vehicle convoy  4) Boring car chase and fight scenes (with camera tricks to make it look more epic which i'm not a fan of and its as bad as lens flares)  5) Bond falls in love with a woman he hardly knows (it didn't feel believable) but that's OK because he's ready to leave his life as a spy 6) The story felt all over the place, and at times Bond is purposely made to look weak and suddenly drinks a RedBull and tears it up 007 style. I didn't really connect with a lot of the characters either. 7) The instant you saw Bond towering over the enemy at the end you already knew he wasn't going to do anything they gave you obvious clues earlier on through M thats how it was going to play out. I couldn't even disconnect myself from the flaws just to enjoy it as an action movie since it was overall boring. If you can't connect with the story, 2.5 hours is way too long for a few flashy scene's.A truly unexciting 'action' movie This is the worst Bond movie ever, filled with emotionless characters that I couldn't care less about. The pace of this film after a predictably exciting start is slow and boring. Unlike his fellow actors, Ben Whishaw as Q manages to portray the only believable human in this whole fake production. Why couldn't JB have been given a touch of Q's wit, humour or vulnerability? No wonder Daniel Craig wants out of this franchise - it's beneath his talent. Such a cacophony of totally forgettable dialogue, people and silly stunts is hard to imagine in a single movie and yet here it is. During one of the 'action' fights when James was being hammered by the evil assassin I noticed the person next to me had fallen asleep and was snoring. That person was an exceedingly eloquent critic.Dressed up as a 10, but contains a 1 What I resented most about this movie was a complete lack of originality, a plot line that all-so conveniently connects everything together from the last Craig movies, making this one sound like it's clever when it's just easy to say. It's a total fake, an unoriginal, a fraud. Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful to look at, but it's empty. Absolutely empty. Where it tries to be clever, it comes up empty. Basically, they slapped the name Bond on it, said that everything was somehow conveniently connected to one another (how brilliant! sigh :/ ) and dress it up with beautiful cinematography. One of the worst films I've ever seen. Predictable and whenever they tried to make something significant, it ended up being oh so silly.I understand why Daniel Craig doesn't want to do another Bond. This is one of the worst Bond films. There was some good cinematography and an all star cast, but just God awful plot and story telling. I don't recommend seeing it. I like all of Craig's Bond films, except this one. Actually, Craig is my favorite Bond actor. In the previous Craig films, they did a good job of using ancillary characters like M, Q and Moneypenny to augment his character so that that his missions seemed logically paced and not solely center on his prowess alone. They deviated from the traditional Bond by allowing him to have Blonde hair, who had a an experience worn face and body that did break down from wear and tear, who was detail oriented and mission driven.  While this film still tried to keep to it's current trend, it reverted back to just stupid unrealistic scenes, like Bond shooting SMG's with one hand from 200 yards out and saying clever one liners like "You're bluffing," I lost track of how many helicopters were used in this film. How many times was bond apprehended and somehow able to break his 'bonds' from his captors and escape the villain's carefully planned exotic methods of execution? And it was 2.5 hours long; plus the editing made no sense of how they got from point A to point B. They could've at least had the villains die in extreme and weird ways, but no, a total let down even on that point.  This is a first time I've written a review and encouraged the audience members not to see this film. It reminds me the Die Another Day film with Pierce Bronson which was terrible, but they squeezed it in because he only had one film left on his contract. Forgivable, Yes, but I hope the producers have something better for the next Bond film seeing as they are pacing these releases 2.5 years apart, which a tight deadline.B for boring, very very boring. Wonder what the refund policy is at Premier Theaters. Of course they are not responsible for this fiasco. It just went on and on and on......plot meandering went nowhere...actors mumbling...no suspense, just one predictable scene after another. Some of the scenes looked like they were shot on my grandpa 8mm Kodak movie camera. And to boot, the "reality" of the fight scenes would meet a standard of a 5 year old. We all know this is not a documentary, but when Bond / Craig get pummeled by the bad guy on the train and his tie stays in place and he suffers not a scratch or a black eye where is the realism...The Islander aircraft flying with its wings clipped outboard of the engines?????.Come on Broccoli team - is this the best you can do? Sean Connery is rolling his eyes and chuckling at the new low in Bond movies. Wasted evening, could have snoozed on a couch instead of a movie theater. Now, let us face it..10 lines of comments on this almost two and a half hours of boredom is a task that even Sam Mendez could not master.Tedious and overblown. Skyfall was superb so this had a lot to live up to and it doesn't. There are so many loopholes; Q was afraid of heights so how can he go in ski lift, London is very busy day and night so how can a helicopter crash into a bridge next to the houses of parliament when it is deserted, how does a car drive up a snow covered steep mountain side without skidding, why do the walls of railway carriages brake up like pieces of flimsy cardboard during a fight ? Etc. Then there is the quite gratuitous violence ( i.e. gouging a man's eyes out.) Plus the ridiculous shoot outs where Bond fells 50 other gunmen who all seem to be very poor shots. Which brings me to the plot - what plot ? This was so convoluted that it seems to have been made up as they went along. I had enough after the first hour but wanted to see how it ended - poorly. This film compares very poorly to either Hit-man or Bourne; Sam Mendies seems now to be the director to avoid. I am sure this film will make a fortune but as the saying goes "If million people like a stupid thing - it is still a stupid thing."Bond with and IQ of 2 I went into this movie blank.I had never seen any trailer, or read any of the reviews about it. But I was bored throughout the entire movie.I felt i was watching one of those 60-70's bond with the dated lines and the tiresome old clichés.And they are endless. As someone else in her put it,you feel like you're watching Austin powers instead. ************warning spoilers************spoilers*****************spoilers I mean you understand from the very beginning that his new boss is working for the enemy. And when the bad guys always find him wherever he goes,you sort'a know right away it's the tracker MI6 put in his body,that helps the bad guys. I felt I was watching a kid movie,with a plot written by a dilatant. Go watch true lies instead,much better movie,with better action. After watching this I get why Craig is tired of bond,cause this script is really baddull , long, no direction ,mess i love james bond,I've seen all the films, and i can say this is the worst one, dull , meandering script, at times i had no idea what the plot was. lots of confusiion ,SPOILER ALERT: like aeroplanes appearing from no where,daniel craig didn't appear to act at all, just the same bemused face all the way through, im surprised he doesn't want to do any more.there are good stunts, car chases, fights, but lots of boredem, and often i was lost, the side story of oo dept being scrapped was just annoying, often extra would disappear completely, i wouldn't recommend this film to anybody. if james bond ahdnt been in it, id thinkit was a b movie made for TVAn Action Spectacle Showing The Vulnerability Of 007 If there was anything we learnt from 'Skyfall' it's that Sam Mendes can make a damn good Bond film, veering away from the over-the-top, explosive nature of the franchise, and focusing more on Bond's personal life and his vulnerability. Well what can be said? He did it again. 'Spectre' will definitely appeal more to those who were fans of the early films in the franchise, most notably 'You Only Live Twice' whose inspiration brings back one of the finest villains to ever face Bond. Mendes has since seemed to take a new direction on Craig's series of films and led away from the gritty, thriller aspect that 'Casino Royale' and 'Skyfall' had and instead propelled the film as an action spectacle, full of beautifully orchestrated stunts, stunning cinematography and non-stop explosive action. The locations are stunning, the score is exhilarating and the cinematography from Hoyte Van Hoytema is dazzling. Christoph Waltz and Dave Bautista, whoever the casting director was on this film, you deserve a huge pat on the back, this film stars two of the most perfect actors to plays villains ever. The much-loved Austrian Waltz whose Colonel Hans Landa has earned him recognition as a fantastic and plausible villain, and ex-wrestler Bautista proving that he is one person not to screw with. 'Spectre' manages to reflect back upon its predecessors in the franchise with references to prior villains, allies and lovers, further drawing upon a story that was in need of a conclusion, a conclusion all fans just couldn't wait for. But... will 'Spectre' be the conclusion we expected? Or will there be more to follow from Daniel Craig and 007? Obviously you don't have to take my word for it, I'm just a mega- Bond fan, but allow me to shed some light upon it if you are having a hard time deciding whether to see it or not? I went and saw this in IMAX - I was blown away. This is the ultimate British action film and one of the finest instalments!Worst Bond Movie ever... how do they fill 2.5 hours with Nothing! This is truly truly awful... now at the outset I have to say Im a HUGE BOND FAN... I cannot believe how dull this movie was... both Daniel Craig and Sam Mendes both must have 007 Fatigue as they both 'phone this in' I know when writing reviews you have to be careful not to add spoilers.. but guess what, there aren't any.. as nothing happens for 2.5 hours... just lots of overly long scenes of people talking or walking down hallways or driving in the desert... God only knows what they spent the $250 million on.. maybe a really good catering truck... Id like to go into depth of how dull this is, but Im too sleepy... . Where do I line up to get those 2.5 hours of my life back... the only thing I can say is that this movie makes Quantum of Solace look REALLY good....Mendez and Craig new milestone Worst Bond Movie Ever !!! Avoid it !! James Bond or Agent 007 has been since it beginning in books and specially in movies the standard male fantasy. He can seduce any women, practice every sport and win, drink as much as he wished and never get drunk, live all the fashion. drive the best cars (preferable Aston Martin) or any other vehicle (like jets, Helicopters, boats) and fight and kill any enemy without regret. The Regan era; and sadly most of his followers; consider the emblematic British spy as a piece of crap and decided to moralize it; both Timothy Dalton movies kisses required an AIDS test. Luckily Pierce Brosnan's Bond was somewhat a back to the origins. He smiled and made jokes;, seduced women, drink and kill when necessary; but some Hollywood asshole and a few absurd critics; decided it was becoming a parody and wanted for Jason Bourne style. A killer without personality looking for vengeance.  Those critics; obviously did not know or even care to understand that Bond's movies were meant for entertainment and never to be taken seriously. It gave us the people who lived and suffered the Cold War; some hope that WW III will not happen. But; the people who control movie industry decided to think for the people and very little care about public want.  So they created this monster. Daniel Craig's Bond is basically a tortured person looking for vengeance. Humor is gone; and it is hard to believe a person without any kind of charisma could seduce anybody or even have any friend. His previous three movies; had at least a decent action scenes that compensated somehow for the lack of fun in the full movie; but this time Mendez and Craig decided to ruin everything for everybody. The peak of the movie is the short sequence before the titles. It is somewhat original (at least the helicopter part); but nothing after that comes even closer to be entertaining. To make matters worse; Tom Cruise's MI-Rogue Nation; has basically the same script. In fact Cruise's self righteous movie has infinite more humor and ten times more action than this absurd drama. Mendez who did a good thing with Javier Barden in the previous movie; waste in this one group of outstanding actors never letting do anything interesting. Christoph Waltz has little change to become an interesting villain and whenever he is able to show his charisma; something stupid happens (who has the stupid idea of making them foster brothers ?). Monica Bellucci is there for no reason. Léa Seydoux could have been replaced for a cardboard; since her chances to act are minimal. Ralph Fiennes looks bored in his short screen time; obviously because his character is not interesting at all. As I stated before; in terms of action; aside from the first scene; there is not much more.  There are a car and plane chase that is interesting. a car chase that is too simple and too dark to enjoy, a few clichéd fights with Dave Bautista and others, a few shootings and an explosion at the end that is simple cheap. None of the action pieces makes a lot of sense and do not take more than half hour in total; so the other two hours of the movie are basically bad acting (Craig with this stone face), terrible dialog (everywhere) and a few postal shots of a train in the desert. It is obvious the movie was troubled when start and director; after making history on create the most successful Bond ever; both want to quit. Why they accepted, other than contractual obligations and a paycheck, are beyond my knowledge; but does not justify this disaster. We the public do not deserve this type of insult. In brief; a very bad movie that you should avoid and let the producers know this is not the kind of cinema we are willing to see.A dull pointless movie. I was finding it incredibly hard to stay awake through this movie. Even the action scenes were quite lacklustre. I think it had nothing to do with the big budget special effects but more to do with the emotionless performance of Daniel Craig's James Bond. Whenever anything exciting happened he acted like he didn't even care. He may do this every day but I can't believe it would ever get old or boring. In between the action scenes there were intense periods of nothingness. It's not surprising really as there was no real plot. I just cannot watch a mindless film about fighting, explosions and getting laid when there's no passion. Speaking of passion the "bond girls" were a big disappointment and had no connection with Bond. It was not believable and super awkward. I know when I've just faced a life or death situation that's exactly the point when I can't resist hooking up with some random. It's such an old concept and it might be time for the Bond series to be put to bed.A thrilling spectacle that ties together the Bond of old with the new. Whether you like Daniel Craig as Bond or not, you can't deny he has been an integral part of the series' highest points. Casino Royale is one of the greatest action thrillers ever, let alone Bond movie, and Skyfall is right up there with Goldeneye as a quintessential Bond adventure. Following the magnificent Skyfall, Spectre had some huge shoes to fill, and for the most part, it delivers exactly what you'd expect. An attention-grabbing, tense opening fight scene, a lovely title sequence (whether the song is good is debatable), and an elaborate sinister plot surrounding James Bond that puts him up against his inner demons more than ever. Does it surpass Casino Royale or Skyfall? Definitely not, but as far as reintroducing the villainous organization SPECTRE into Bond canon after 40+ years, the film does more than a serviceable job, giving us a stylish action-adventure to boot. SPECTRE is revealed to have been affiliated with some of Bond's biggest threats - Mr. White, Le Chiffre, Raoul Silva - all under the control of one puppeteer, the head of SPECTRE and James' archnemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. It isn't much of a spoiler, as speculation was rampant ever since the first trailer (and hell, when the name of the movie was released). What's important is its execution, and Spectre leaves breadcrumbs for you to follow all the way through the belly of the beast. Not only is Bond under SPECTRE's crosshairs, but MI6 itself is experiencing a merger led by Max Denbeigh (Andrew Scott) who wants to eliminate the 00 division and focus solely on global intelligence. It's apparent early on that Blofeld has eyes everywhere, and while he works primarily in the shadows (Christoph Waltz only having 20 or so minutes of screen time), he poses a looming threat to Bond because of his sheer cunning and a past secret that unravels itself when the two finally meet. Many parts of the film feel like a throwback to classic Bond. The icy environments, the car chase and gadgetry, the use of a massive threatening henchman, a train fight that is heavily reminiscent of From Russia With Love, and of course the modern birthing of Bond's greatest adversary. The acting all around is fantastic, with Craig continuing to impress as the suave womanizing secret agent. Thomas Newman turns in another wonderful musical score. But perhaps the most impressive feature is Sam Mendes' directing. The shots in this movie are absolutely gorgeous - the action scenes are incredible to watch and easy to follow, the landscapes are fresh and vibrant, and even the simplest of scenes - Bond and Blofeld walking up to each other for the first time - are quietly introspective yet palpably tense. Tension lingers throughout every moment of Spectre even when not much is happening, and the suspense is high enough to hold your interest for the full 2-and-a-half hours. Spectre is not perfect. Much of what happens narratively is predictable, a few lines don't go over too well in context, and you eventually find something out about Blofeld that is pretty ridiculous taking previous Bond canon into account. Also, given Waltz's reputation for knocking villainous roles out of the park, he's noticeably underused here. But these flaws don't tarnish the pure entertainment value to be had. What you want in a James Bond movie is over-the-top action surrounding the world's greatest spy who's up against unbeatable odds yet still comes out on top thanks to his charisma and general badassery, and this is precisely what Spectre delivers. Daniel Craig may or may not return as Bond, and if he doesn't, this movie serves as a perfect send-off. But as the series constantly reminds us, "James Bond will return...," and Spectre is just another welcome chapter in the immense story of everybody's favorite super spy.Not a masterpiece - but an entertaining love letter to the classic Bond films peppered with a healthy dose of irony First off, let me get something out of the way here: I like to be entertained. Entertainment, as we all know, comes in different shapes and sizes; it can be smart, profound, intellectually stimulating and so forth – or it can just be escapist fun. Now what kind of entertainment you expect from a James Bond film is up to you; as for me, I go with fun. Regrettably, the last three 007 instalments fell a bit short in that department (at least for my taste), and since I expected this new film to be more of the same, I didn't exactly get my hopes up.  Well, I can only say I was pleasantly surprised (although judging from most reviews here, I seem to be in the minority). Instead of further exploring the somewhat dark, dramatic route the previous three films took - which, I must admit, worked very well in Casino Royale - Spectre unexpectedly goes in the exact opposite direction. Sam Mendes and John Logan apparently came to the conclusion that it was time to bring back one of the most crucial ingredients for Bond's success with audiences over the years: the fun. Don't get me wrong; it's not suddenly ALL fun and games for Her Majesty's finest spy (and Craig still portrays him as a character driven by inner rage) - but the new film is a virtual celebration of the whole James Bond universe, from past to present, including the less grounded and over-the-top elements from the older films. In fact, after a stand-out intro sequence in classic fashion, the spy with a license to kill takes us on a ride which - tonally - feels like travelling back in time to the glory days of such classics as You Only Live Twice, Goldfinger or From Russia With Love (and it's a ride back in time in more senses than one). This is supposed to be a spoiler-free review, so I won't go into any of the story details, but what unfolds after the introduction plays like a combination of the more grounded, serious Bond we've come to associate with Daniel Craig's films, and the more self-aware spy-romps of the Roger Moore era. It's a mix that doesn't always work and tone and pacing can be a bit uneven at times (especially during the third act), but Spectre largely succeeds in paying homage to many of the classic Bond films while still delivering the gritty action people come to expect from the newer instalments and staying true to the character Craig has so successfully made his own. And despite all the references and callbacks to classic 007 adventures, Spectre still manages to continue the storyline of the three previous films. So while his second entry in the world's longest living franchise is far from a perfect film, I believe Sam Mendes achieves exactly what he wants: he intentionally embraces the old Bond formula, but he also plays with it, twists it and introduces new story elements.  So my verdict: Spectre is a love letter to the classic Bond films, and while it might not be the masterpiece many people seem to have expected, there is a lot to enjoy here. It's a solid, almost classic Bond film with insane action, great set-pieces and a fantastic cast; upon first viewing, I'd rate it 7 stars out of 10. Rare Film Gems For Cinephiles: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/It was..... some fourth form of 'bad' Dialogues are no where near the standard of a Bond movie. Dave Bautista, I truly don't understand the need of his role in the whole movie. A Psycho who has a .50 cal Double Barrel Pistol is unable to handle a girl. WOW. The ending... It's ruthlessly, awfully, childishly produced. The way the 'Literal King of Villains' is taken down is an insult to Christopher Waltz acting carrier, and to the Bond movies villains too... (I can cry while thinking about it). Waltz has been under utilized. The person who can be the king of villains in acting has just been given like 12 minute part. Where the hell Sam Mendes's thinking coming from... certainly not from his head. And I think, we should start expecting the same level of production from Barbara, as there are no more original bond novels left. All they can do more is to worsen it only. Casino Royale was the last original true in bond spirit movie... Rest, Bond may RIP... P.S. My heart is broken for what Sam did to Waltz carrier in this movie...Steer clear of this turkey I have just watched the new Bond offering - please please will someone put this franchise out of its misery as it is well past its sell by date. Everyone knows that when you see a Bond film much is formulaic but in this case it is just plain old tired. The plot is pedestrian, the acting (such as it is) is dire and the directing - well Mendes needs to run a mile away from the next one and stick to what he's good at. Daniel Craig has done some good work in his career but I'm sure this has to be his worst and I trust he won't be doing the next one. The whole film is such a crushing bore I would rather watch paint dry than even think about watching it again. Please don't waste two and a half hours of your life and steer clear of this turkey.Specter brought back the roots of James Bond As a die hard fan of James Bond, I found this film to be simply nothing more than a classic. For any original James Bond fan, you will simply enjoy how the producers and Sam Mendes re-emerged the roots of James Bond. The roots of Spectre, Blofield and just the pure elements of James Bond that we all miss even from the gun barrel introduction. This film deserves higher ratings in my view. I don't want to spoil the film , but I am finally glad the writers brought back the roots of James Bond. A true fan nothing more nothing less. I don't know what else to expect from a James bond film and Spectre does just what I originally expected in a James Bond film. It opens a whole new extension to have many more films to come. The cast does a superb in their roles and many salutes to Christopher Waltz in his enemy role.A Treat for Veteran Fans Spectre may be receiving mixed reviews within the community, but I believe that this is simply credited to the fact that Spectre differs from the other Craig Bond films like Casino Royale and Skyfall. This latest installment, in my own opinion, tips the hat to the old Bond-style of action that we loved in most of the earlier films. Granted it is not as brash as say Goldfinger, with character names such as Pussy Galore. But it doesn't exactly fit into the box of Daniel Craig's films either. This movie tells a story. It isn't just nice suits, and cars with beautiful woman surrounded by flying bullets in front of the canvas of a massive explosion (even if this film does boast the record for the largest stunt explosion in movie history). No, this movie gives us some nice character development. With a nod to the many years of Bond that has preceded Craig. It was a nice feeling to think that as a Bond fan across the the entire Franchise, that I was privy to some knowledge and little Easter eggs that maybe some of the newly converted fans (those that have joined the agency only since Craig assumed the 00-status) may not have caught on too. The only downside I could see anyone pointing out with this film is maybe the length of the film. This film could be reviewed as a rather long one, especially to those who might lose interest trying to involve themselves in a story that started back in the days of Connery. But if you are a fan of the entire franchise spanning across all 24 films, maybe even some of Flemming's original novel, then Spectre is a must see."The dead are alive": Spectre is a gift for Bond fans and a great action thriller with a surprising amount of complex and contrived heart. This review will be mostly spoiler free because despite all the problems that the production and the writing suffered this movie is a self conscious sleight of hands between all the things you think you know about the plot mixed with dark and funny surprises that pave their way through around the final half. And that's an incredible triumph over all the odds that must be experienced in bare bones. It's a terrific Bond film (more Bondish than Skyfall in a gloriously preposterous way)that has the equals in production values, score (Thomas Newman mixing Skyfall cues with new ones fits well), direction, performances and the brave narrative decisions taken in its script. But let me say this in advice: it may not exactly reach the same smart and complex, deeper and meaningful way achieved in the very personal Skyfall. The priceless opening sequence: Masterful. Eye popping. Five minutes (or so) in one tracking shot. Never seen before in the franchise. Maybe the best prologue EVER. This is how you start a movie in a truly rip- roaring fashion. Opening credits: It's a special affair to take part. Sam Smith tune has a little to compare with the epic scoop from Adele, but as a slow burning ballad is terrific for the movie (and very gorgeously designed for it, culminating in a very special opening titles). Is about a man who is an assassin but at the same a time a human being with his flaws (more or less in a way like Dench's M wants for Bond at their first face to face in Casino Royale) and his uncertain demise to find someone pure and up to him The rest of the movie (If I'd reveal anything, I would deserve a ban from all the users of this site): it takes a little of time at some parts and it probably would affect in direct comparison to its predecessor. But this movie is able to live up the plot of Skyfall by deeper extravaganza and funnier build up even if it tries to rehash elements rather than add other news (wait a while in order really meet the villain, spy games in MI6 office, Bond has to operate in the shadows again). Taking its basis as a somewhat follow up (it starts as an extended epilogue indeed with a special message from someone of the past brought back from dead "for a few moments") it develops its own big story with style, patching the whole Craig's era so far and even paying homage to certain iconic moments of his run (there's a cracking torture scene this time too that may push the rating a bit too far) and the franchise overall (the fight in the train, a cat, iconic action sequence in the snow). Just when you think that the script is falling in a familiar territory, the film suddenly subverts your expectations using human drama (very effective for Bond and Oberhauser) instead the action or the fatigue. And the reveals make these characters even more likable and interesting. This smells like the truly 50th anniversary but 3 years later due to finding itself very encouraged to include references of the whole 007 story than the personal previous outing: It 's a thrilling and tragic Bond film, with best of Connery/Moore (and Lazenby) roots (gadgets included) but without becoming too campy or an absurd parody of itself. The performances (Fiennes, Whishaw, Harris, the twisted Andrew Scott, Monica Bellucci in her little amount of screen time "without mercy" and obviously the Bond "new" main interest: Léa Seydoux) are top notch as we could expect from Sam Mendes (even better in the direction). But Christoph Waltz (as insanely brilliant as we were looking for even if falls short to be as resonant as Silva and being closer to a more billed Le Chiffre), Dave Bautista (perfect, brutal, ruthless and iconic) and Daniel Craig (he nails it: operatic complex, dark, emotional and riveting-best Bond EVER) are the three best things that could ever happen to the movie in performances terms. From its orgasmic start in Mexico City to his hard hitting conclusion in London, Spectre is a gift for newcomers and classics Bond fans and a great action thriller with a heart. I don't know if it's the best Craig's Bond movie (Casino Royale is still a modern classic and Skyfall maybe fell in a better context and expectations in comparison with this one), but is a perfect entertaining and that was the same exciting affair happened to the two ones mentioned. While its deep psychological punch may not being so surprising nor original this time and the effectively reliable political urgency that made Skyfall so unique is left a little underweight with the M vs. C plot, Sam Mendes and the whole team can breathe relaxed. They have wrapped up their story in a new whole level and in a spectacular victory fashion by succeeding presenting a riveting story in terms of pure emotion and action. And if this is the real farewell to Daniel Craig's run he couldn't really ask for any better final outing, as well to thank to the producers and writers to have gifted him the greatest Bond era of all. He really leaves the tux (and the broken soul inside it) on a beautiful high. I'm even afraid if he agrees to come back (with almost the same team or another) even being my favorite Bond Because to surpass this is going to be a hell of a difficulty.Craig's Best Bond Movie Just came out of the theater and I'm literally blowing away! As a moviegoer and movie lover looking for a good entertaining is simply irresistible not to like this movie even just a little. But if your genre is the action or you are a Bond fan-boy (but a real fan-boy, the one who knows that Bond is a dark killer with a great sense f humor as well a troubled human being and not just a fantasy and silly spy in silly missions with a handful of gadgets) then SPECTRE will be a total feast for you. Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig give us another triumph after the polemic "Skyfall" and this time both have managed to get a perfect balance between that intimate psychology from the previous outing and the nostalgia from a classic Bond movie (with quality, not just passable) that hadn't had hit the theater in a very while. By that way we found ourselves in a very Bond centric movie (perhaps the only one in the whole franchise in which Craig is the absolute protagonist without being overshadowed even by the handsome villain) that explores and expands the character beyond the limits from the last third of Skyfall and a truly genuine adventure full of suspense and crazy twists to maintain the attention. Across many places (Rome, Tangiers, Austria and coming back to London for a classic suspenseful climax) we found Bond getting started in a personal mission out from the MI6 (although later he will enlist some of his confidence partners with him) that drives him from a enigmatic widow (Monica Bellucci steals the scene alongside Craig) to a beautiful and looking innocent Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux) until coming face to face to Franz Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz doing himself stills being fitted for the role and gives chills in his scenes with Craig). The story is bigger than Skyfall, Quantum and Casino Royale all together. And that's funny because this movie is really connected to all of them (another thing that makes me love Daniel Craig's Bond era). And marrying the credible word (political games, drones included) with the preposterous touch of any of the classic movies of Bond (Oberhauser, his hidden base, his plan) as well giving the Bond past a lot more of light and an effective closure by the end makes SPECTRE to succeed over any negative expectation and to give the audience the most entertaining outing coming from Craig and probably his best Bond yet (anyone knows if he's returning for another one even at another studio?). It's clearly a movie for those of you who are truly fans of Craig's unique run, but for all the haters too (because that lack of Bondish elements are there and most notably than ever). The humor is back (a drunken conversation with a rat makes the funniest and most hilarious moment) even at times that you couldn't imagine (the torture scene is intense, much better than the classic one in Casino Royale, but handed with dark laughs at some parts). The action is crazy and shot with class (the one shot that opens the movie is the most beautifully complex the franchise has given us so far) and the script goes along the way without going down at any moment or being lazy. It tries hard to touch a lot of plots into a big one to the final part of the film and that implies to focus on some parts more than others. But all the movie wants to be seen and experienced is explored and is a hell of a ride. SPECTRE is the most enjoyable Daniel Craig Bond film (and probably his farewell-with-a-bang), and the best Bond movie in recent memory. I did not exactly know what to expect for this installment after being put to sleep after the breathtaking Skyfall (so all the hype surrounding it) but not such a bold movie like this. If he (Craig) really leaves after this one, he will achieve something that Connery, Moore &amp; Brosnan failed to do: say goodbye to the character on a stunning high. My personal ranking of Daniel Craig as James Bond: SPECTRE (1º) / Skyfall - Casino Royale (2º, both deserve it) / Quantum of Solace (3º).A movie only for hardcore Bond lovers and British nationalists I will keep this spoiler free. So no details from the movie. This movie was so boring, terrible, repetitive and overall bad, that seeing how it has 6.9 rating on IMDb makes this site's review page very untrustworthy. If you are not in one of the two categories named in the title, I can honestly bet you will not give this movie more than a 4/10. There is absolutely no thought put into this movie. The scientific methods they have used to bring the former impressiveness of Bond authenticity is cr**. Excuse my language but this movie does not deserve to even be considered a Bond movie. It is a shame for the Bond franchise to let the character exist in this anomaly. Mediocre actors that make a very bad script look disastrous. I would rate it cr**/10 but sadly I cannot.my name is boring, blandjames boring Seriously, i think i slept through half of this movie only to be waken up by the janitor 2 and half hours later after the movie ended, seriously, this movie is boring, first of, the opening is just, HERE'S AN OCTUPUS, AND ANOTHER ONE, AND ANOTHER ONE AND ANOTHER ONE, with some bland ass music to go with, also the james bond girl in this movie is awful, like , she isn't even a character, she is a sex toy that james bond plays with boring/boring- FOR GOD SAKES THIS MOVIE IS BORINGEasily The Worst Among Craig's Bonds This is easily the worst among Craig's Bond movies up till now. There is absolutely nothing to look forward to in this one. Craig could not sign off with a bang in his supposedly last Bond flick, maybe that's the reason he has declared to be back with yet another one with the studios, as he himself admitted he just does not go want to go off with a whimper. It had to do with a super-weak script and a very very ordinary Bond girl for company. I kept waiting for this new Bond girl, as this has always been something to look out for in Bond flicks and it is only halfway into the movie did I realise, oh, is this Lea Seydoux who will be giving Bond company for the whole movie, come on, 50+ Monica Bellucci would have been a far more attractive prospect there. The only saving grace was probably the villain Christopher Waltz. He is damn good as he always is, can never forget him in the opening scene of Inglorious Basterds. Action scenes were cliche and this movie expectedly got average reviews. 6/10.The best Craig Bond movie Anyone who rated this as less than a 7/8 is a moron. It's embarrassing at times to read the clever idiots opinion. This is very clearly and quite possibly Craig's best movie bar Layercake and one of the best Bond outings, fullstop. The beauty of the Bond movie is the homage it pays to all the previous films, the fight scene on the train point in case. Craig smoulders as usual, but this time it is play delicately and with the smoothness a 00 agent should portray. Yes it's another Bond escapade of the usual expectation, yet this time they got it well above par. Craigs previous attempts have been suspect, but not this time. Please ignore the below par reviews, because it easily deserves more than this, anyone who has a big pathetic chip on their shoulder and a keyboard at hand should know better, you are a poor show. Even the worst miserable git would give this an easy 6.. Good movie. End of.A sensory splendor and emotionally impactful story, let down by ambiguous scripting This might not be the best Daniel Craig Bond, but it is a great film none-the-less, a visual and auditory feast, which is let down by its script, which could have brought further clarity to what is an emotionally impactful story.  Firstly, the film is technically and artistically stunning showpiece. It continues the Bond globe-trotting experience. Each location is worthy of acclaim. From the opening Day-of-the-Dead sequence in Mexico City, to the closing credits, Spectre is striking. I'm not just talking about the static scenery either. The action is well-choreographed, suspenseful. and, given Bond's penchant for against-the-odds survival, the set-piece moments finely toe the line between 007 and over-the-top outrageous. Even in it's most frenetic, the action is visceral and not reliant on obvious cgi, so 'believability' ultimately wins out. Similarly, the music elicits a awesome and suspenseful chord. There is a constant undercurrent that builds the films tone of looming, pervasive background threat.  On that note, the villain of this film is a throwback to Bond of old but represents a greater universal fear, anxiety brought on by all-seeing-eye of the information age. MI6 too is under attack, by threat of irrelevance, by way of technological progress, and some key architects of this progress. Bond's character is shaped by this impending threat, and the villain looming in the background. HIs tragic existence as a 00 agent is brought into light here.  Bond wrestles with the demon of profound loss, his loved ones jeopardized by the life he chose to lead as an agent. As we come to learn, the film's villain is somewhat like a puppeteer, pulling the strings behind Bond's life and loss. At first glance, this does a disservice to Bond's story, alleviating his guilt by giving him a clear scapegoat for his pent up grief. But, as we come to learn, this connection is not arbitrary, but crucial to Bond's upbringing. As in Skyfall, we are given just a glimpse into Bond's past, of a time when he more human than agent. If throughout the film Bond appears traditionally disconnected, stoic, and dangerous, defined by his desire for cheap thrills of women, drink, and violence, at the expense of those he cares for, that guise in more transparent than ever, and in the cracks in his facade, we glimpse the humanity he wrestles with.  For despite his roguish actions, Bond's fondness for Money-Penny, Q, and M, as well as his reverence for country and honor, are on display as well. He brings the crew into his world by bestowing upon them trust. He allows them to help him, a rarity for a man who built his life and career upon distrust in the world and others. Though this display of trust, Bond reveals his true colors. These MI6 relationships are the backbone of the movie, heightened by excellent work from Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, and Ralph Fiennes.  Ultimately, despite all that I enjoy about this film. I can't help but feel the the script relies too heavily on cliche and ambiguity. I ask: Would it have better served this film to make the storytelling a bit more transparent to the viewer through richer dialogue and character motivations? Spectre's deeper themes may rely too heavily on visual language and extended metaphor to usurp the one dimensional traditional Bond tropes on display . On the other hand, this film is a sensory experience, and perhaps the ambiguity of the scripting and superficial gloss serves to reinforce the themes at play. As one must look beyond Bond's obvious actions to understand the man inside, the viewer must search beyond the film's veneer to uncover the emotional resonance.I am your best chance of staying alive This is a sequel to SKYFALL. Bond battles "the author of all his pain" as his secret past is revealed. An international organization plans on uniting all the top intelligence agencies in order to combat terrorism. However their goals are not benign nor are their methods honorable. Bond has his hands tied by his own agency as he operates in a semi-rogue fashion. The film gives us plenty of over the top action, Bond girls, Bond lines, Bond car and the Bond drink. I don't recall the casino. It shows the evolution of a man. It also shows us why men like Bond are obsolete in the modern world of intelligence gathering and drones....or does it? Perhaps it is me, but the film seems to changed to have more action than drama.worst colorgrading How boring it is i ll not repeat. Technically that movie is lack of quality. All movie is yellow color, JB face color changes every picture and again yellow face like everything . Movie quality is like from 80's . Who made this s.. colorgrading he should quit this job and find something else."SPECTRE is one of the better Bond films and certainly the most complete one of the Daniel Craig era" As far as movie franchises go, nothing and no one can touch James Bond. 50+ years and 24 films so far have ensured 007's status as the seemingly immortal superpower of British cinema. If we needed further evidence of this: 2012's SKYFALL became the highest grossing James Bond film ever. In addition, it currently sits in 13th place on the list of highest grossing movies of all time. In short, SPECTRE has a lot to live up to. But if anyone's up to the task, it's Bond, James Bond. The film starts very strongly; an opening sequence that must be regarded as one of the best in the Bond's history. A single tracking shot following Daniel Craig's 007 to his intended target, eventually culminating in a fight onboard a moving helicopter is absolutely thrilling. By the time we've faded into the fantastically realised opening credits, complete with Sam Smith's haunting vocals, the stage has been well and truly set for something quite special. From this point the film makes the most of its bladder-challenging 148 minute running time, taking Bond and company from London to Rome, Tangier and snowy Austria. Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography ensures each new location is presented as something resembling an excerpt from a well-produced tourism video. This really is Bond as we've grown to know him over the past 50+ years: he travels, he fights and he's always got time for a quick shag. Daniel Craig has taken his time settling into the role of Bond. CASINO ROYALE was largely devoid of the wisecracking one-liners and suaveness that the previous entries had in bucket loads. As the Craig-era films have progressed, there's been a gradual reintroduction of the familiar character traits, to the point where SPECTRE really feels like Bond is now his old self again, or should that be new self? Another part of the gradual reintroduction of the familiars also came with the first appearances of Moneypenny (Harris) and Q (Whishaw) as well as the man who would become M (Fiennes) in SKYFALL. With the band together at last, Bond has come full circle, and SPECTRE revels in its moments of the fun Bond has with his colleagues, particularly Q. Any good Bond film of course, needs its Bond villain. The casting of Christoph Waltz as the far too mysterious Franz Oberhauser seems like inspired casting. Waltz has a natural flair for the sinister and as previous Bond's have shown; it's not always the more physically astute villains that are the most dangerous. It is a shame therefore that Oberhauser never quite comes across as the villain he could have been. He falls into that easy to step into sandpit of being villainous for the sake of it, a self-explained back-story into the reasoning's behind his villainous ways feels a little underwritten. Providing the perfect contrast to Oberhausen's small stature is his chief henchman Mr. Hinx (Bautista). While his name may sound like something you might name your cat, it's clear from his introductory scene, in which he showcases a particularly nasty way of offing a potential rival, this is one of Bond's nastiest foes yet. A later fight sequence between Hinx and Bond on a train is also very hard-hitting, even for a Bond film. Try as they might, one thing the Bond writers haven't quite mastered yet is the 21st century Bond girl. Previous instances show that an effort has been made to make the new-era Bond girl strong and not always necessarily in need of a man to save them... only to eventually need saving from Bond by the time the climatic events are taking place. SPECTRE's main girl Madeliene Swann (Seydoux) falls nicely into this category. An area where SPECTRE really excels is in some of the smart script work. The MI6 building still stands with the damage inflicted during the events of SKYFALL; a visual metaphor for the state of the British secret service and its perceived perception. This is where Andrew Scott's Max Denbigh (or as Bond affectionately nicknames him: C) comes in. He's a member of the British government intent on bringing down the 00 program as he perceives it to be 'prehistoric'. He is insistent that a global communication of privacy-invading surveillance is necessary to combat the potential threats of this world. He's also a bit of a snarky git. His interactions with M provide some of the film's best bits of dialogue, and also provide this film with its biggest laugh-out-loud moment towards the film's climax SPECTRE feels very much like a culmination of what has come before in the Daniel Craig-era of Bond. There are many references to the previous films and even a big reveal of a major plot thread that ties all the films together. There are also a few nice knowing nods to previous Bonds (hello, pussy) just to keep the die-hards happy. There are a few familiar Bond fallings that do threaten to hamper the fun at times, but there is enough here to ensure that SPECTRE is one of the better Bond films and certainly the most complete one of the Daniel Craig era.The second weakest of the Craig Bonds Although 'Casino Royale' is often considered the best Daniel Craig Bond film, my personal favourite is actually 'Skyfall'. That said, 'Casino Royale', after liking it well enough, fared much better on re-watch. 'Quantum of Solace' however was a major disappointment, and for me deserves its distinction as one of the worst of the series. While the James Bond series has had its highs and lows, most of the films have been very enjoyable. At least three or four of Sean Connery's Bond films are among the best of the series (my personal favourite of the lot being 'Goldfinger'), with the only big misfire being 'Diamonds are Forever', despite one of the series' greatest theme songs. 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' is also very good'. Roger Moore's films are mostly entertaining enough, though for me the only great one was 'The Spy Who Loved Me', with 'A View to a Kill' and 'Octopussy' (an unpopular opinion though) being two of the series' weakest. Wasn't crazy about Timothy Dalton's two entries, 'The Living Daylights' is the better of the two but is only decent. Pierce Brosnan's are not very popular with some Bond fans, for this viewer they're not bad; loved 'Goldeneye' and 'The World is Not Enough', liked 'Tomorrow Never Dies' and while 'Die Another Day' has enormous problems (especially Madonna's theme song being in the top 5 worst Bond themes, some cringe-worthy puns, over-silliness in the second half and an overload of CGI that was also pretty awful), I don't consider it that irredeemably bad, because it started off strongly and most of the performances were good, especially from Brosnan, Dench, Youn, Cleese and Pike, the only real sore spot being Madonna's cameo. Starting with what is good about 'Spectre' it is mostly very stylishly made with great use of atmospheric and beautiful locations. Some of the action sequences are exciting, particularly the train sequence and the supercar chase through Rome. The Mexico City pre-credits sequence is also pretty epic. Sam Mendes' direction has its moments, with evidence of style, elegance and thrills. There are also some good performances. Daniel Craig is as charismatic and debonair as ever, handling the dramatic and action moments well, though there was a slight sense of him starting to get bored of the role (nowhere near as bad as Connery in 'Diamonds are Forever' though). Christoph Waltz is very good- if also rather underused- as the main villain, a role that suits him to the ground, playing him with smarmy, sinister relish. Ralph Fiennes is enjoyably starchy, David Bautista conveys some menace as assassin Hinx and Ben Whishaw brings genuine spark to Q. However, for me, and other viewers too, 'Spectre' does suffer from some major problems. It particularly suffers from a confused tone, with a mix of violent action, humour with in the in-jokes and spy clichés, thriller and romance. While there are moments like some fun to spot references, neither component come off consistently or even that successfully. A good deal of the action is overblown and cartoonish rather than exciting (only the Rome chase and train sequence are memorable), with some the violence gratuitous. The humour is misplaced and border on parody that would have been more at home in something like 'Austin Powers'. The thriller elements do lack suspense and tension, due to parts that feel too recycled which gave it a real over-familiarity. Lastly, the romance is not interesting or developed at all, and has no natural or obvious chemistry. Léa Seydoux is a rather vapid Bond girl with very little to her, while Monica Bellucci is pretty much wasted in a too-brief appearance. Hinx is for personal tastes rather underwritten, but David Bautista does do what he can and as said conveys some menace. Andrew Scott's C is an obnoxious character and played every bit as obnoxiously. The film is far too long by half an hour, drags in the second half, ends ridiculously and anti-climactically and contains a muddled script with clumsy over-congratulatory in-jokes and hackneyed, dreary dialogue and feels very overblown in places. Mendes shows a gift for visual style and drama but forgets the suspense and tension unfortunately, while the editing (though not as bad as 'Quantum of Solace') is enough to make one confused and seasick. Thomas Newman's score is somewhat repetitive, and Sam Smith's theme song- like most- did absolutely nothing for me and one of the most undeserved Oscar wins in recent years, for me it is certainly the most undeserved in the category that there's been too and one of my least favourite Bond themes. It's ballad-like feel is at odds with the style of the rest of the film and feels like there are more than one climax that never happens when it's meant to. Smith's singing does not fit the song either, it's a song that sounds like it requires a more powerful voice and more emotional connection, the falsetto (a sound and technique that in all honesty I've never liked) was completely out of place as well and made Smith sound like a wimp. All in all, not as awful as it has been made out, and it is a better film than 'Quantum of Solace' but disappointing (especially with 'Skyfall' having been so good) and Craig's second weakest Bond. 5/10 Bethany CoxA Bond film in the classic mould Following on from the success of SKYFALL, the latest James Bond flick sees both Daniel Craig and Sam Mendes returning to the franchise for a film which seems strangely old-fashioned, perhaps deliberately harking back to the classic days of Bond. SPECTRE isn't a perfect film by any sense, and the problems lie with the script. Some of the scenes are lazy, like the way Bond readily escapes from entrapment or doesn't seem to suffer ill effects after undergoing some - shall we say intense - experiences. It's also overlong, at two and a half hours, and with judicious pruning it could have been snappier and pacier. At the same time, it's a resolutely entertaining picture, simple and yet one which has enough momentum in it to keep you watching throughout. Craig gives a subdued turn as the slick and professional British agent, allowing others to shine; Christoph Waltz is a delight, as ever, while Lea Seydoux is the best of the Bond girls since Eva Green starred in CASINO ROYALE. I'm always pleased to see Monica Bellucci up on the screen, whilst Dave Bautista's henchman is in the classic mould. SPECTRE has an enjoyable, globetrotting feel to it, and I particularly liked the way that supporting regulars like M, Q, and Tanner all had a greater part to play here. The way the story links up to previous films is cleverly achieved, and the action sequences, although familiar and done before, are well handled, with good effects work. SPECTRE also retains a surprisingly vicious edge despite the 12 certificate. As a fan who's seen all of the Bond movies out there, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed this one too.cool but not great James Bond (Daniel Craig) followed the previous M's instruction to kill Marco Sciarra. He only shows the message to Moneypenny (Naomie Harris). This leads to an embarrassing Mexico City incident for the new M (Ralph Fiennes) who suspends Bond. M is organizing a merger with MI-5 and C (Andrew Scott) is creating surveillance system "Nine Eyes" looking to shut down "00". Bond steals a car from Q (Ben Whishaw) to attend Sciarra's funeral where he meets his wife Lucia (Monica Bellucci). Using the stolen Sciarra ring, Bond infiltrates a Spectre meeting headed by Blofeld (Christoph Waltz). Dr. Madeline Swann (Léa Seydoux) is the daughter of a murdered Spectre agent and key to bringing down the organization. With the return of Spectre, I was hoping for a great villain to take his place among the greats of Bond villains. Waltz barely gets up in his first scene and takes forever to return. He's a missed opportunity for a supervillain. Andrew Scott is the sleazy weasel but he's not that guy. This movie is exceedingly cool and filled with sharp action. It's missing something. It's missing greatness. It's missing the great memorable thing. The movie is sometimes a little slow with long expositions. The audience don't really need it. They already know who the bad guys are. They just need Bond to catch up and find them. This is a fine Bond movie but one that may be forgotten among the rest.Solid and enjoyable even if it could have used more character and spark to make it more than 'a Bond movie' With all the hype around this film, it was hard to come to it as just another Bond film and not the 'event' that the release of a new one has become. However, it is best to come to it as such, because essentially this is what it is – another Bond film. Drawing a lot from the series already, and recreating very famous organizations and characters, the plot sees a continuation of the road of the previous films, with a message from beyond the grave sending Bond in pursuit of something he is not quite sure of. In doing so the film essentially delivers a lot of elements that we have come to expect from this recent run of films, and from Bonds generally. The pre-credits sequence is not quite as thrilling as it was billed, but is still a solidly enjoyable series of stunts run together (although I suspect the technical achievement of the helicopter sequence is probably more impressive than just watching it). From this point onwards the film runs a familiar course, which is not a bad thing, but too often the film seems to forget to thrill as it should. No doubt it is robustly constructed, and the quality and crafting is evident in almost every regard, but this is not always a good thing. Bond himself feels a little bit on the rails, and pulled along by the plot. Of course an element of this is that this is precisely what the plot of the film is, but at the same time I didn't get much 'person' from him compared to previous films, and his later connections with Swann didn't remedy that. Likewise too many other characters do what they say on the tin – and it was only really Whishaw's Q that had some spark to him. Craig himself is strong as a presence, and this does bring out the feeling that he could easily have delivered more given the chance. Seydoux is a throw-back Bond girl, needing rescuing and not having a great deal of character. Waltz is a great villain because he is very good at this sort of character – so watchable in the last few films he has done, here they give him space and dialogue to be an imposing presence, and he does it well. The rest of the cast are very much supporting and doing so in defined roles – which is fine but seems a shame with so many big names. Spectre is still a solidly enjoyable film; it doesn't live up to the hype, or the pressure put on it by Skyfall, but it is still a solid Bond. It does all the things you expect it to do, albeit with a rather workmanlike feeling that will make you wish it had been delivered with just a bit more spark and energy to it at key moments.Bond vs. surveillance "Spectre" is the newest entry to the long-running and successful James Bond franchise. It is Daniel Craig's 4th turn as the world's most famous agent and the second time for Sam Mendes as director. The movie takes place basically right after the end of "Skyfall" and there are several references back to this 3rd Daniel Craig Bond film, but also to the two films before that, mostly about Vesper Lynd, but also about LeChiffre. Judi Dench has a brief scene as M again and we find out what happened to Mr. White. But now that I mentioned M, let's elaborate a bit on that. Ralph Fiennes is back in the role and he is a very different M than all the ones before him. He actually keeps firing and fighting, something you totally wouldn't expect if you knew these characters from the old movies sitting behind their desk from 8 to 5. Then again, Fiennes' M has some kind of military background if I remember "Skyfall" correctly. The female main role is played by French actress Léa Seydoux and well. what can I say about her. I think she is a good actress and has stunning looks and I totally can see Bond falling for her. She looks breathtaking in this film, almost as good as in "La belle et la bête". The acting is above-par for Bond girls usually and she is doing a fine job with her character. Still, there are incongruences. She decides to leave Bond as she cannot live with another assassin, but quickly changes her mind, which destroys a strong farewell scene. And in the end, Bond chooses her and decides not to kill Blofeld and he says to Q that he is gone. Second time, Craig's Bond is deeply in love after Vesper Lynd and I wonder how they will elaborate on that story line. I hope she won't get killed early in the next Bond film, but I guess they somehow have to come up with a story to get her out of the picture for Bond to return to MI6. It will be quite a challenge to make this one credible and not too similar to Lynd's. If I hadn't known that Craig will return, this actually could have been a very nice ending to his turn as James Bond with Blofeld finally not being able to take Bond's most precious. I briefly mentioned Blofeld above and he is played by Christoph Waltz. I must say I like him as an actor, but by now, he feels very similar with his mannerisms in totally different characters he plays. His characters always have their very own brand of humour and it would actually be nice to see him as a completely serious character at some point. I found his Blofeld not as interesting as Mikkelsen's LeChiffre or Bardem's Silva, which is quite a pity as they tried so hard to make him more memorable with him being the head of Spectre of course and also with the whole brother story. Waltz' "cuckoo" was even a bit cringeworthy during their talk. The scene with bond tied up in the chair and Blofeld acting like some psychopath scientist was really creepy, almost a touch of "Marathon Man". And of course of Connery's Goldfinger almost losing his balls to Auric's laser in this classic movie back then. Lets talk a bit about the henchmen: Wrestling legend Dave Bautista plays a character who does not really add something great to the story and does not even make sense. He comes into the room, kills apparently a high-profile aide of Blofeld and is still appreciated. I guess this was intended to show what a cold-blooded killer he is. But wasn't he intended to perform the stadium attack in Mexico City. This was completely forgotten for the rest of the film. Still, he was fun and his final fight with Bond (and Swann) and this one was a nice addition to the long history of memorable train fight sequences in Bond films. Generally, he had nice presence. Calling him a modern Jaws would be too much honor, but he was fine overall and they did great in letting him be quiet. That emphasized his cold-blooded ruthless character. "Sherlock" fans will appreciate the presence of Andrew Scott here. However, I must say that I did not find him too memorable. There is no denying he is a talented actor, but everything he did here he already did on "Sherlock" and not worse. Monica Bellucci was okay in her scene and shows us that Bond also has a weakness for older women. Ben Whishaw I remember not liking too much in previous films, but he was fine here as well. I am not yet too sure about the theme song this time, but it's probably not among my favorites. All in all, this was a good movie and I highly recommend going to a theater to see it on a big screen, not on a small computer screen. Then again , I am probably biased because of how big a fan of the franchise I am. I think it's worse than "Casino Royale" and "Skyfall", but better than "Quantum of Solace". One reason may be that the two I liked more have legendary locations, the ones in the title and this one and "Quantum of Solace" do not. As a whole, this was not a great Bond film unfortunately, but a pretty good one with some nice inclusions and references to older films (Blofeld's scar). I certainly recommend the watch, but I still hope that the next Bond film (with or without Mendes) will be truly great again.Entertaining and Amusing When the viewer watches any 007 franchise, he or she knows what is going to see: an entertaining full of action adventure, with beautiful women, car chase, conspiracy, great villains, predictable story and a brainless screenplay. "Spectre" is no exception and provides an additional amusing situation, with the weirdo Daniel Craig seducing the gorgeous Léa Seydoux and Monica Bellucci without any chemistry. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "007 Contra Spectre" ("007 against Spectre")Quality craftsmanship; Kevin McClory's credit missing I salute the craftsmanship of "Spectre", certainly a quality production ($245,000,000 buys a lot of value on screen, not counting product placement $) and have enjoyed it - I've been going to Bond movies since catching "Dr. No" back in my hometown of Cleveland in 1963. I was surprised to see no Kevin McClory credit, but perhaps I should know better. Not really a case of vendetta or getting even -you can read briefly about the S.P.E.C.T.R.E and Blofeld litigation in the notes for the film on IMDb. I interviewed McClory 30 years ago in my capacity as a Variety newspaper reporter in NY, as he was fighting Eon regarding the rights to such material. He had worked with Ian Fleming on screenplays and claimed creation rights to some Bond material (he ultimately produced 2 Bond films). So no credit at all, after the rights were finally cleared 30 years later? Seems vindictive to me, but like all legalisms, there may have been a good reason, akin to those good old "gag orders" we read about all the time, or nondisclosure agreements when cases are finally settled. Under the supervision of the heirs to the Broccoli fortune and franchise, director Sam Mendes has done a commendable job though where being a traffic cop ends and creativity begins is unknown on a project of this scale. It's easier to blame the director for a fiasco (similarly budgeted and to me even more highly anticipated "The Golden Compass" from the great Philip Pullman's novels, also starring Daniel Craig, for example). But the clockwork precision of "Spectre" is worth examining. Mendes works with a classic tension &amp; release formula, well-adapted to the Bond genre. The sadism that Ian Fleming popularized in pop culture (building on the perhaps unfortunate inroads made earlier by Mickey Spillane with his Mike Hammer novels) remains, particularly in the stock Blofeld scene of a committee of bad guys sitting around an out-sized conference table, so that film's lead goon can gorily kill one by gouging his eyes out. Bond himself is tough and rugged in Craig's interpretation, without meting out as much unmotivated violence as his licence permits. The travelogue nature of the franchise, established early on with exotic globe-hopping settings, is maintained here, even throwing the viewer a bone every once in a while with a panoramic shot worthy of "Lawrence of Arabia". Problem of course, is that unlike a David Lean film the material is paper-thin, not adding up to much thematically despite the attempts of the screenwriters to inject elements (villain Waltz and hero Craig as sort of step-brothers) into the mix. But the meticulous nature of the build-up to each segment's derring-do payoff is admirable, and shows a Hitchcockian expertise at using the film medium to manipulate the audience. I prefer more subtlety, but I certainly recall my youth when being manipulated by the thousands of movies I sat through was pleasurable in an escapist way. Again as an adolescent I was drawn to the sexiness of the Bond pictures, Ursula Andress being such a wonderful starting point, but it seems that is a Fleming element that has been squeezed out of the current formula, likely to maximize returns. Sad fact is that in a world drowning in pornography, no one need turn to James Bond for skin (other than the obligatory suggestiveness of the opening credits' sequence, here very well done by Dan Kleinman), so where a shooting script might have listed "Insert sex scene here" we merely get an ellipsis when Bond is ready to get down with all- time great sex symbol Monica Bellucci, or even the leading lady Lea Seydoux. As a fan of storyline pornography I'm well aware of the difficulty of maintaining any sort of pacing AND including a lengthy sex scene in a movie, but Mendes's solution of eliminating the sex scenes altogether is quite disappointing. He does gift us with a few seconds of Judi Dench's "M" character from beyond the grave. One last footnote - though Bond is quintessentially British it is worth reminding folks that technically the productions are American, since (I refer you to Alexander Walker's excellent industry book "Hollywood, England" for details) all the British studios and production houses turned down the original Bond projects, with the honchos at United Artists funding and giving the green light, making "Dr. No", with UA and its successor companies like MGM (though now Sony through Columbia is distributing the pictures), produced by Broccoli and Saltzman from a UK base. The backing was always from Hollywood.Waltz Makes It Worthwhile A cryptic message from Bond (Daniel Craig)'s past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organization. While M (Ralph Fiennes) battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind SPECTRE. Each Bond film really needs to be viewed on its own merits, because trying to determine the continuity is confusing. This time within the series' continuity, the version of Spectre that appeared in "Diamonds Are Forever" was written out of the timeline with the 2006 reboot of the franchise in "Casino Royale", making its appearance in "Spectre" its first in the new timeline. So just pretend you never heard of Blofeld or Spectre, although you probably have. The continuity is also strange with the change of casting on M and Q, but it is a good change. The younger, fresher Q is a good attempt to move the series into the 21st century. The idea of blood that can be tracked makes sense, but probably would have sounded ludicrous in earlier entries. The action scenes are also much better filmed than "Quantum of Solace", making this a strong follow-up. What does the future hold for James Bond? As of now (September 2017), there is no firm date or title as far as I know. Seems like it might be time to bring him back...Spectre Skyfall became the highest grossing film in the UK, beating the record of Avatar, so there was great anticipation for the next in the film series for the famous spy created by Ian Fleming, from returning Skyfall director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition). The name SPECTRE will be familiar to those who know the books and the film series, it was originally an acronym (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), it is now just simply the name of the organisation, but elements seen previously remain. Basically the previous M (Dame Judi Dench, in a short cameo) unofficially ordered James Bond 007 (Daniel Craig) on a mission to Mexico, there he kills two men planning to blow up a stadium, criminal Marco Sciarra (Alessandro Cremona) survives after the building he is in collapses, Bond chases him and they fight in a mid flight and out-of-control helicopter, before throwing Sciarra and the pilot out Bond stole Sciarra's octopus ring. Returning to London, the new M (Ralph Fiennes) takes Bond off field duty indefinitely, M is currently in the midst of a power struggle against the head of the recently merged MI5 and MI6 Joint Intelligence Service, Max Denbigh, codenamed "C" (Sherlock's Andrew Scott), who wants to close down the double-0 section. Bond goes against orders, travelling to Rome to attend the funeral of Sciarra, he visits his widow Lucia (Irreversible's Monica Bellucci), he seduces her and she tells him about a criminal organisation her husband was a part of and where they are meeting that evening. The head of the table (Christoph Waltz) mentions the events in Mexico, also mentioning Bond by name, turning to face him when doing so, Bond escapes and is pursued in car chase, him in his new gadget filled Aston Martin DB10 and organisation assassin Mr. Hinx (Dave Bautista) through Rome. Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) informs him of a lead heard in Mexico and the meeting leads to former Quantum member Mr. White (Jesper Christensen), revealed to be a subsidiary of the organisation, Moneypenny also checks for Bond the name Franz Oberhauser. Bond finds White in the snowy mountains of Austria, he is dying of thallium poisoning, White tells Bond to find his daughter, Madeleine Swann (Blue Is the Warmest Colour's Léa Seydoux) who will take him to L'Americain, which will lead to the organisation, White then commits suicide. Bond finds Swann before she is snatched by Hinx, he chases the kidnappers in a plane and causes the three cars to crash, Bond and Swann escape, Hinx survives the crash. Bond and Swann meet with Q (Ben Whishaw) who reveals Sciarra's ring contains digital files linking to Oberhauser, the leader of the organisation, and previous enemies such as Le Chiffe and Raoul Silva, Swann informs them that the name of the organisation is Spectre, and that L'Americain is a hotel in Morocco. At the hotel the couple stay in the room Swann's father used to stay in every year, Bond discovers a secret room built by White, full of videotapes, charts and photographs, as well as coordinates for where to go next. On the train going to the nearest point they are attacked by Hinx, Bond manages to throw him off the train, at their destination they are picked up and taken to a secluded facility in the desert, where they are met by Oberhauser, who reveals himself as the son of the man who looked after the younger Bond when he was orphaned. While torturing Bond, and a white Persian cat seen roaming about, Oberhauser reveals that C is part of Spectre, he is feeding all intelligence data straight to the organisation, Oberhauser also reveals that he faked his death twenty years ago and goes by a new name, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, but Bond manages to escape, causes an explosion that injures his enemy, and destroys the facility. Back in London, Bond and Swann meet M, Bill Tanner (Rory Kinnear), Q and Moneypenny, they plan to stop C and the launch of Nine Eyes, the intelligence co-operation agreement between nine countries, in fact a takeover by Spectre, Bond gets kidnapped in the process, but Nine Eyes is stopped before launch, and in a struggle with M, C falls to his death. Bond is taken to the former MI6 building, derelict since the attack by Silva, he disables his captors, and meets Blofeld, now with a large scar across his right eye and face, he tells that the building is rigged to explode and he has three minutes to save Swann, hidden in the building. Bond finds her within the time and they escape in a boat onto the Thames, Blofeld gets away in a helicopter, but Bond fires on it and causes it to crash on Westminster Bridge, Bond aims his gun at Blofeld, but decides to let M arrest him, and Bond leaves with Swann in his repaired Aston Martin DB5. Also starring Stephanie Sigman as Estrella and Alessandro Bressanello as Priest. Craig remains cool and determined, Seydoux is a good choice as the Bond girl with guts, Bellucci (the oldest Bond woman) gets only minutes on screen, Waltz relishes smirking as the villain everyone expected to appear (because of the title), and the supporting cast of Fiennes, Scott, Harris and Whishaw are well placed too. I did question the critics giving the film three stars (instead my assumed four) out of five, but perhaps when I properly examine it, it does have small clichés, but no matter, the story flows well and is easy to follow, the locations look great, and the action and chase sequences as always are high- octane and exciting, an entertaining spy adventure. It won the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Original Song for "Writing's on the Wall" by Sam Smith, the first Bond song to reach number one in the UK charts. Very good!the James Bond franchise should have ended decades ago Back when Sean Connery played James Bond, the movies were all about him being a suave dude who bedded a bunch of hot babes. He left the role because the movies were getting too tacky. By the time that Pierce Brosnan rolled around, the movies were nonstop gimmicks. When 2006's "Casino Royale" got released, a bunch of reviews called it the best Bond movie in years and said that it had brought the franchise back to its roots. I eventually saw the movie. Sure enough, just more gimmicks. The 1967 "Casino Royale" is the good one. And so, "Spectre" is still more gimmicks, and mark my words: Daniel Craig is NO Sean Connery. I'll admit that Léa Seydoux is a real babe, but that doesn't cut it. I have no plans to ever see "Quantum of Solace" or "Skyfall". I don't care how many people praise them. This franchise wore out its welcome mat decades ago. Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Revolutionary Road) should be ashamed of himself. Avoid it!at times Spectre is a lot of fun. other times its just... over-elaborate, even for 007 The opening sequence of Spectre will surely be a reason many people will want to get a copy of the movie after its theatrical run once it's on DVD and online, or even to just tune in if people know it'll be on TV. In one of those super-long (maybe too long?) tracking shots, Bond, in a skeleton mask during the Day of the Dead festival in Mexico City, goes into a building (with a girl by his side at first), then as it looks like there's about to be some lust he breaks off to get to his actual target: some sinister figures in a building next-door. Then it goes into one of those BIG action set pieces, mostly involving a helicopter that Bond has a BIG fight in, and has to do BIG maneuvers to make sure that he doesn't take out civilians. It's one of those sequences that the public goes to 007 movies for, and I'm sure Mendes knows this. One is almost tempted to say he, so to speak, blows his wad there, but this isn't to say Spectre, the 24th Bond film, is poor by any means. Just... flawed, to say the least. This is the movie that actually, without spoiling too much, ties together the Daniel Craig Bonds that we've had so far, with the villains and the love interest in Casino Royale, Vespar Lynd, in the mix. There's really two plots which eventually converge: 007 tracking down through Rome and Austria (and eventually Tangiers) what significance a ring with an octopus insignia has and who is connected to it - semi (not really) spoiler, it means everything - and then as the new M (Ralph Fiennes) has to contend with MI6 being folded into MI5, and a new surveillance program taking shape. Oh, and MI6 may not really be what it is any more, and a whole new government program to be the "new" spy organization takes shape. If this latter part sounds at all familiar, it should be if you've been to the movies just this year; I could've sworn I saw this very similar storyline for Mission Impossible Rogue Nation, which also dealt with the "new" taking over the "old" and the spies we know and love having to go rogue. That doesn't happen right away in Spectre, but it's certainly in the air. The other thing that will seem familiar is... well, a lot of things, mostly if you're a Bond fan by any stretch (casual watchers may miss things, not unlike people who went to, I dunno, Star Trek Into Darkness and only, maybe, knew about Khan). The real "sectret" part has to do with a Figure in the Shadows (that old, treasured cliché) who is played by Christoph Waltz. What does he have to do with 007? Do they know each other? All in good time, if you see the movies, you'll find out. But, again, it won't be any big surprise if you've seen other movies, like Thunderball as the primary example. Once again Mendes has visual flair and capable, stylish filmmaking (and a new DP in Hoyte who is really remarkable, barely a shade less than Deakins for Skyfall), and Craig is game to play this character the best he can. But for all of the build up of the first two acts, it felt like the third let itself down, or let me down or both. It's not that it doesn't build to something elaborate - on the contrary, it's something SO elaborate it's over-elaborate, in both how this entire Spectre organization functions and the actions that Waltz's character takes from one scene to the next as he finally takes charge as a villain. The trouble is too, as much build up as he gets and as much as Waltz soaks up playing this guy, there's not enough of him. Or, maybe there is enough, but what he does is things that we've seen Bond villains do before - or, to the point that we've seen certain elements that have been *parodied* in other films. All that's missing are fish with laser beams attached to their heads. This isn't all to say the movie is bad in any way. Spectre will deliver for fans of the franchise and just those people wanting some escape with the Martini-gun-toting-super-sex-being that is this hero. The filmmakers clearly love this world, in making characters like M and Q matter more than they might've in the past which is all well and good (Fiennes and Whishaw do well when they can), Monica Bellucci shows up and is great to see as the oldest (but, sadly, briefest) of Bond women, and the ending feels almost like the entire end to the franchise itself (not that it would be, it'd be like saying that there are no other organizations to monitor surveillance in the world oh nevermind). I may even watch it again on TV some time, but as it is plot gaps and/or set-piece over-compensation got the better of this movie.All the thrills one hopes for in a Bond Film As this, the forth of the Daniel Craig era Bond films opens we find Bond in Mexico City on the Day of the Dead. The camera tracks a man in a skeleton costume as he, and the woman he is with, walk through the crowd and into a hotel; the man removes his mask to reveal that he is in fact Bond. He excuses himself and goes for a rooftop walk. He then watches two men talking in the building opposite before opening fire moments later the building explodes! The target, Marco Sciarra, escapes with Bond in pursuit; he catches up with him just as he scrambles aboard a helicopter and a fight to the death ensues over the crowded Zocolo Square. After the credits Bond is back in London where M reprimands him for his unofficial operation in Mexico before telling him that their department is to be amalgamated into MI5 under the leadership of a man Bond insists on calling 'C'. C believes that the OO section is obsolete; the future of intelligence will involve intercepting communications and drones to this end he intends to create 'Nine Eyes' a group of nine nations that will share all such data. Bond is told to stay in London but inevitable doesn't. We learn that the previous M had sent a posthumous message to Bond telling him to kill Sciarra then go to his funeral. Here, in Rome, he meets the dead man's wife and learns that he was part of a secret criminal organisation. Over the course of his investigation he learns that this organisation is known as SPECTRE and it has somehow been behind the events in the previous three films. He also learns that more than one person he assumed was dead is in fact alive; including the head of SPECTRE Franz Oberhauser; somebody he knew as a child but now calls himself Ernst Stavro Blofeld! As with all Bond films there is a Bond Girl and this one is Madeleine Swann, the daughter of SPECTRE member Mr. White who is being targeted for assassination by the group. At two and a half hours in length this is one of the longer Bond films but at no time did I find myself wondering how much longer it would be going on. The viewer is immediately gripped in the opening scene, which appears to be one long tracking shot. We then get an explosion, chase and finally a fight in a helicopter all before the opening credits! From then on we get a number of great set-pieces including car chases, Bond rescuing Madeleine from would-be abductors as he chases their cars in a plane and numerous fights and shootouts. While the action is great there is also a solid story that nicely links back to the previous three films and (re) introduces the most famous of Bond villains in a way that gives him some back story. The cast does a fine job; Daniel Craig is on top form as Bond, a role he has made his own; while we instinctively know he will prevail there are moments where he makes us believe his character is in real and imminent danger. Christoph Waltz is suitable villainous as Blofeld, Andrew Scott is delightfully unpleasant as C and Léa Seydoux makes a fine Bond Girl as Madeleine Swann. Talking of Bond Girls it was nice to see Monica Bellucci as Sciarra's widow showing that you don't have to be young to be sexy. Dave Bautista was also rather fun as the thuggish assassin Mr. Hinx; his stature and lack of time for small talk reminded me of the character Jaws from the Roger Moore era but without the campness he even got a brilliant send-off that was clearly a nod to the film 'Jaws'! Amid the action there are some scenes that may disturb some viewers; including an eye-gouging and Bond being tortured. This is balanced by plenty of humour though; most notably Bond's car that doesn't have all the weaponry loaded as he expected. There has been talk of this being Craig's last Bond film, while I hope that is not the case, the conclusion would make a fitting conclusion to his time as Bond. Overall a really fine entry to the Bond series; up there with the best.too long at the fair, 007 Time to retire this franchise. Big budget boredom - 007 is like Ol' Man River - he just keeps rolling along, but in the case of 007, this franchise has had it. My advice: After the first truly electrifying 13 minutes, turn this off and keep your happy memories.  In this one, Bond goes rogue after receiving a message from the beyond, in a way. He infiltrates a secret meeting and learns about the evil group SPECTRE. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, there's a new M (Ralph Fiennes) and a merger with MI5 and a decision to kill the Double O program. Might be a good idea, in fact. Madeleine Swan (Lea Seydoux), the daughter of an old enemy, may have the clue to finishing off SPECTRE.  A good cast includes, besides Craig, Fiennes, and Seydoux, Christopher Waltz as the head of SPECTRE and Sherlock's Moriarity on PBS, Andrew Scott, one of the best of the new crop of British actors. But all that doesn't help the script. That great budget and no one can write an exciting story. Car chases, sex with women Bond met 2 minutes ago, cartoon villains, torture - it's all there in small enough doses to make the 2-1/2 hours go by like the original Birth of a Nation.  I've seen Craig on stage twice - he's wasted here. About as exciting as flipping channels with a remote.Craig's list ... ... is coming to an end. Obviously every so often a new Bond will emerge and I think Daniel Craig is almost done with his Bond cycle. I think there is another planned, but after the really good Skyfall, this falls a bit behind in many terms. Than again, it was almost impossible to capture that lightning again. Too many things happened in the previous one, many linked and appreciating the past Bonds. As you can see from my rating, I still dig the movie, it's just that it has it's flaws. It kind of ticks all the right boxes (great opening sequence), good villain, some really good action set pieces and a tension that holds up until the end. Some still have an issue with Craig portraying Bond, but then again, when Idris Elba was suggested, many disagreed with that too (I think he'd be a great Bond, but that's a whole different story). Depending on your taste, you'll either like this or notSpectre is perhaps the best of the Daniel Craig James Bond movies yet! Besides this being the fourth consecutive Daniel Craig James Bond film, it's also the fourth me and my movie theatre-working friend had seen together. While he doesn't consider himself as much of a Bond fan as yours truly, he did really enjoy this one as did I. It had many familiar moments I remember from the previous entries yet there was also plenty that was new like the expanded roles of this current series' versions of both Q and Moneypenny in their helping of Mr. Bond on his mission. It also marked the return of the organization of SPECTRE and the main head of that, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, played here by Christoph Waltz though he's not initially ID'd as such. There are two Bond women here, Monica Bellucci and Lea Seydoux, that provide just enough heat to make one like them immediately and also care for them when their backgrounds are revealed. And Craig seems more comfortable in the role than ever now! Great action scenes abound, as always! So on that note, both of us highly recommend Spectre.It's time to shake up the franchise and add some FUN! 007 is back, hunting for the head of sinister criminal organisation SPECTRE, which plans to use an international intelligence network to further its nefarious activities. Spectre opens in fine form with a thrilling pre-credits action sequence that sees James Bond (Daniel Craig) narrowly escaping death when a building collapses around his ears before leaping on board a helicopter to do battle with a baddie above the crowded streets of Mexico City; then Sam Smith begins his godawful caterwauling, and the film never recovers. This latest instalment in the long running British spy series is another overly sombre adventure that once again lacks the excitement and thrills that I remember from the Bond films of my childhood. People love to scoff at the Roger Moore movies, but at least they were hugely enjoyable slabs of blockbuster entertainment, full of exotic locations and colourful characters; in contrast, Sam Mendes' movies are drab and largely boring. I don't blame Craig—he actually makes for a great Bond—it's the overall tone, overly elaborate plots, and the film-makers' absolute refusal to have any fun that are to blame.What else there is there to do. 007? Sam Mendes returns to direct SPECTRE, and if SKYFALL was not enough...the thrill meter will sway back and forth with this one. Blue-eyed Daniel Craig returns to prove doubters that he is a genuine 007. Being dismissed by his superiors, a rouge Bond will only prove to excel as he swaggers and saunters with that half-smile in this his supposedly swansong in his James Bond tenure. Slick editing,gorgeous visuals,some haunting moods and maybe a bit too much nostalgia. Enthralling action scenes with 007 annihilating villains, no matter the gender. And probably one of the most grandiose and absorbing opening sequences taking place in Mexico during the Day of The Dead celebration. A crippled chopper and a crumbling building top chase only primes the pump for the viewer's captivation. The not so secret agent bounces from one eye-popping locale to the next to make shift work of his assignment. Christoph Waltz as Blofeld and Dave Bautista playing Hinx are formidable old-school villains. The British Aston Martin driving stud, Bond, will rely on assistance from M (Ralph Fiennes), Q (Ben Whipshaw), Moneypenny (Naomi Harris) and Lea Seydoux as the winsome widow, Madeleine. Also featured are: Monica Bellucci, Andrew Scott, Jesper Christensen, Alessandro Cremona and Rory Kinnear. Is there any doubt of the James Bond 007 franchise continuing?Irritating Mix Of Old And New . Possibly The Weakest Craig Bond Film I'm not much of a Bond fan but the great thing about Craig era Bond is that they're Bond films for people who don't like Bond films . None of this killing a bad guy then turning to camera making a wisecrack . None of this climatic fight sequence on a mode of transport with laughable back projection . With Craig's Bond if he says he's in Mexico the production team make sure the audience know he's in Mexico and not in a Shepperton film studio . If Bond gets hit in the genitals he'd feel it the same as 3.5 billion men . If a woman who he cares about gets killed he gets angst ridden about it . In other words we - the audience - can relate to this . It'd be a step too far to say Craig's Bond is now part of realist cinema but I for one feel this direction has saved a tired and dying franchise . With SPECTRE the series has taken a rather clumsy step backward  !!!! SPOILERS !!!!  It's not all bad . Sam Mendes keeps up the riveting work seen with the brilliant SKYFALL . The film opens with a continues shot where the camera gives the impression it's all done in one take . A female character leaves her house to stand beside a pool where two assassins follow her and again it's a great example of a tracking shot and you do get the impression the technical staff are after those Oscars next year . The film also contains gritty violence such as a Spectre agent being executed in a graphic manner . If you loved the art-house and deadpan tone of the previous three films then it's still sustained . Such a pity it's never sustained enough and we have to endure a few bits of nonsense we'd thought we'd never see again By this I mean we're back to the gadgets era of Connery , Moore and Brosnan . A car with an ejector seat and flame throwers ! Oh dear . Didn't like this much back in the day and don't like it now . In many ways it's even worse now because it jars with the serious tone of much of the film . Another annoying aspect is that Bond is able to endure much physical violence such as a fight on a train and brain drilling and yet seems to physically recover instantly . A million miles away from the Bond seen in CASINO ROYALE  This film's major failing is however contained in the title -SPECTRE . You've seen the trailers with Christoph Waltz telling Bond that he's been the cause of his pain etc but none of the motivation or continuity is ever satisfactorily explained . Spectre ties in with Quantum but why ? and how ? It does give a hint as to its philosophy when a character mentions "weakness" and decries "Democracy" which might indicate the organisation is a literally fascist cult but again this goes totally unexplored There's no reason for this organisation to be called Spectre except to reference earlier Bond films and use nostalgia as a marketing tool . It also has a plot twist of sorts where Waltz character reveals his true identity but again this seems like cynical fan servicing . He never seems like the character he is supposed to and is more in line with Elliot Carver from TNL  I found myself slightly disappointed by this film .SKY FALL had a lot to live up to and had been looking forward to this ever since the trailers came out . To be fair I didn't find myself pining for the Moore and Brosnan movies but SPECTRE feels like a retrograde step where gadgets and set pieces take precedence over plotting and character motivation . If SPECTRE breaks box office records it will be because of the previous Craig films and not because of its own meritsSpectre James Bond (Daniel Craig) has finally made his way to the terrorist organization called Spectre, a uniform group with its members from all over the world, led by Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) who has a personal connection to the 007 agent. After an unsanctioned trip to Mexico City to stop a member of Spectre from using a bomb that would have been set off in a stadium full of people, which is accidentally exploded in a building containing terrorists, James Bond must answer for doing so without authorization from M (Ralph Fiennes), suspended from duty. However, Bond isn't mindful of such a penalty as time off, and instead follows orders from his former boss (Judi Dench) who had sent him a recording prior to her death...this is what initiated Bond's mission to Mexico City, which was only a start to what lied ahead. MoneyPenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) reluctantly align themselves with Bond although their division in the British MI6 is rumored (and eventually are notified) to be shut down by a dangerous idealist, "C" (Max Denbigh, played by Andrew Scott), on the verge of forming an alliance with global powers in an effort to set up a spy network supposedly to "protect us all across the world". Max's agenda, however, could very well be sinister if implanted. Meanwhile, Blofeld has special plans for Bond who is trying to locate and eventually protect the daughter of a former member of Spectre, named Madeleine Snow (Léa Seydoux). Bond wants to find Blofeld and Blofeld has envisioned the opportunity to meet him, and "Spectre" brings them together. As you might expect, eventually their meeting would be rather explosive. The Mexico City sequence opens "Spectre" with an absolute bang, as a building crumbles and collapses which winds up being eerily reminiscent to 9-11, and seeing Bond nearly perishing as his own building is took out by the domino effect is directed so magnificently, I can just hear the oooos and aahhs. Director Mendes' camera follows Bond in what seemed like an extended uninterrupted shot during the Day of the Dead in Mexico City as the locals are all in costume, and 007 walks into a hotel with an attractive woman on his shoulder, in a room that had a window that leads to a ledge he walks directly to a spot which is a direct bead to a room containing the Spectre member he is targeting for termination. This whole opening set piece ends with Bond and his quarry moving through a crowd in the city during the celebration until both are fighting in a chopper over the crowd! The battle between Craig and former pro-wrestler Batista in a train (after the latter leads a car chase after Bond during a high speed affair in Rome which itself is a thrill ride) with Seydoux getting involved, and the headquarters of Blofeld going up in flames thanks to a watch that packs a punch (Q provided to Bond prior to fleeing to Rome despite orders from M to stay in London), as it appears Bond's gig is up (he's bolted to a chair as Blofeld plans to use small drills to torture Bond through commands into a computer), are highlights. Also featured is Bond chasing after Batista and some of Blofeld's henchmen who kidnap Seydoux from her clinic in Austria by way of a plane (they in SUVs) and Bond needing to rescue Snow from the set-to-be-demolished MI6 building in London before it detonates (thanks to Blofeld who suffers a nasty scar on the side of his face, ruining his eye). Waltz, no surprise, knocks it out of the park as Blofeld, the ultimate nemesis of Bond, sociopathic and stone cold when it comes to doing whatever is necessary against 007 and to gain global power. The way Blofeld reminds Bond of how he has killed all those he loves over and over truly emphasizes his cold blooded nature. Waltz is a good casting choice for the villain, confident and smooth, but his Blofeld's obsession with bond ultimately is his downfall. Batista has the right brutish body type perfect for a bruising heel used to give Bond a hard timenot needing to talk, he has this intimidating presence that is important to the role he is cast. Fiennes getting to play hero at the end when facing off with Scott is a treat, as well. Scott is one of those who manipulated his way into a prominent position, using that power as an intentional nuisance to M and his team.The Sceptre And The Rows ... ... and rows of Multiplex seats filled with the popcorn brigade watching this worldwide, How bad is it? Let me count the ways; first off it takes six writers to come up with The Spy Who Went Into The Cold or, to put it another way, to rip off John Le Carre inasmuch as this could just as easily have featured Daniel Craig as Alec Leams, seemingly on the outs with his Masters but in reality under cover on a secret 'mission' and working with the clandestine blessing of 'M'. As if that weren't enough they have no respect for the audience; example 1: Bond and Dr. Swan are in the middle of East Jesus in just the clothes they stand up in, next moment they'b both managed to change and only a little later in what is essentially the same sequence Bond appears in a tuxedo and Swan in an evening dress and a little later STILL, they have acquired luggage. example 2: Swan is kidnapped from under Bond's nose in the middle of a city; the kidnappers make off in three cars and within minutes are being pursued by Bond NOW PILOTING A PLANE. Where did it come from? Where did it take off from in such an urban setting. No doubt the popcorn brigade won't allow reality to spoil their enjoyment.Just follow the movie logic This film tells the story of James Bond trying to stop an underground terrorist organisation from taking over the world's secret intelligence service. "Spectre" opens with an intense scene in Mexico City, where buildings get blown apart and dangerous fights happen in a helicopter. After that, the story is a bit slow but still engages my interest. I recall that "Casino Royale" was so quick paced, scenes were so short that it was like an attention deficit fest. In "Spectre", the director takes time to tell and build the story. However, the story is not so strong, as the villain is a diffuse organisation that is so mysterious, that viewers are often left in the dark. There is a funny and memorable scene that shows James Bond taking a watch from Q, and this scene is used in the watch commercial before the film, which is a nice touch! After watching the whole film, I think "Spectre" is a good film but there are too many illogical moments that makes you wonder how did that just happen. To enjoy it, just follow the movie logic, and don't question anything in the film!This Bond Delivers More Than it DisappointsA Bit Underrated The 24th James Bond Film and Daniel Craig's 4th outing as 007 has plenty of Thrills and Spills but is also not without its Shortcomings.  The Pre-Title Scenes are Full of Flurry and Fury and Impress with some Stunning Camera Work, Visuals and Effects. The Title Sequence is a Washed Out, One Color Yawner, even when the Octopus tries to Upstage and Surprise. The Song...Well those High-Notes are Painful and One Imagines the Singer in a Bond Torture Device forced to the Limits of a Human Vocal Performance. It's Painful. The most Disappointing Thing is the Underwhelming Appearance of the SPECTRE Organization and Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) in particular. The Titular Global Crime Syndicate (whose acronym is never explained) seems Underfunded and generally Boring and Bland. Although it does make sense that in 2015 Their attempt to Take Over the World is Focused on the Surveillance of "Everyone". A Topical Warning. The Action and Chase Scenes, Along with the Hand-to-Hand Unleash the Adrenaline. The Bond Girls are Nothing to get too Excited about though, unless You want Your Bond Girl to be more of a Brilliant, somewhat Plain Home-Spun. The Musical Score can be a bit Repetitive but it can Race the Heart at times. Overall, a Good Entry in the Series. Entertaining as Expected. But one Last Thought on the whole Craig Series. There may be too much Emphasis on the "Personal Bond". It has come to the point of "No More Please", after all, Bond is Better as a Fictional Super-Spy and there really is No Need to Know so much about His Life Outside the Agency. It is Doubly Unnecessary to Make Stuff Up, Biographically, that Isn't from the Ian Fleming Stories.Not As Good As "Skyfall" But Better Than "Casino Royale" The 24th entry in the James Bond film franchise, Oscar-winning "American Beauty" director Sam Mendes's "Spectre," tops "Casino Royale" (2006) and "Quantum of Solace" (2008), but it doesn't surpass "Skyfall" (2012). Ultimately, despite a variety of problems, this globe-trotting 007 outing boasts enough good stuff to offset the bad. If picturesque settings, robust performances, sumptuous production values, and a lavish $250 million plus budget constituted the bottom line for a cinematic blockbuster, "Spectre" would rank as the best ever Bond. Unfortunately, several factors undermine "Spectre,"including Sam Smith's mellow theme song, sophomoric scripting, lackluster villains, and a sluggish 148 minute running time. The above-average but formulaic screenplay by "Gladiator's" John Logan, regular Bond scribes Neal Purvis &amp; Robert Wade, and "Edge of Tomorrow's" Jez Butterworth generates occasional spontaneity. The scenes depicting a brawl aboard a helicopter and later on an aircraft crashing into a convoy of vehicles amount to exciting milestones for the series. The car chase through Rome is thoroughly routine, and the fistfight above the train is more noisy than dangerous. Furthermore, the basic plot recalls the Tom Cruise espionage epic "Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation" where the CIA sought to disband the IMF. One of Bond's secondary opponents dreams and schemes about dismantling the double-O section, putting our protagonist out to pasture, and relying on a global satellite surveillance network to thwart terrorism. Despite these drawbacks and letdowns, "Spectre" benefits from an incomparable supporting cast. Ralph Fiennes distinguishes himself as Bond's new boss, M, while Ben Whishaw as Bond's quartermaster extraordinaire, Q, has more time to display his skills. Former wrestler David Bautista acquits himself admirably as Blofeld's chief thug, while Jesper Christensen is a hold-over from "Casino Royale" and "Quantum of Solace." If you're a Bond fan, you'll appreciate the homages to "From Russia with Love," "You Only Live Twice," "On Her Majesty's Secret Service," "The Spy Who Loved Me," "For Your Eyes Only," and "License to Kill." Naturally, Daniel Craig returns as pugnacious 007, and he guns down a score of hooligans, beds a couple of babes, and swaps blows with the biggest hulk of a henchman since Roger Moore's Bond grappled with Richard Kiel's humongous Jaws.  "Spectre" unfolds in Mexico City during the annual Day of the Dead festivities. James Bond has been shadowing Marco Sciarra (Alessandro Cremona of "Malèna"), and he discovers Sciarra and his cronies plan to explode a bomb in a crowded nearby stadium. Mind you, the new M (Ralph Fiennes of "Skyfall") didn't send Bond to pursue this dastard. Instead, 007 received a posthumous video from the former M (Judi Dench of "GoldenEye") about Sciarra. In the event of her death, M instructs Bond to kill Sciarra and attend his funeral. Bond tails Sciarra to Mexico City and eavesdrops on a conversation before Sciarra's conspirators spot him. A harrowing shoot-out ensues. One of Bond's bullets ignites the bomb, and the explosion collapses half a city block, with 007 narrowly escaping death. Predictably, M is furious about the international incident that Bond has precipitated. Of course, Bond says little about his reasons for killing Sciarra. Later, Bond sneaks off to Rome against orders to confabulate with Sciarra's widow Lucia (Monica Bellucci of "Shoot'em Up"), and he gate crashes a gangster summit. He runs afoul of the nefarious Mr. Hinx (David Bautista of "Guardians of the Galaxy") who pursues him. Simultaneously, M tangles with the new head of the Joint Intelligence Service, smarmy Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott of the BBC's "Sherlock"), who has merged MI5 and MI6. Denbigh wants to scrap the double-0 section and replace it with a Babel-like global satellite surveillance system codenamed "Nine Eyes." Although Denbigh has the ear of the Home Secretary, something about the mysterious conglomeration of private backers who financed his project bothers M. Meantime, Bond races off to rescue another damsel, Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux of "Blue Is the Warmest Color"), who identifies the criminal organization that Bond has been investigating as 'Spectre.'  If you haven't seen Daniel Craig's earlier James Bond escapades, you may be baffled by some of the events and characters. Not only does "Spectre" bring a sense of closure to Craig's previous Bonds, but it also reunites our redoubtable hero with his career-long nemesis—Ernst Stavro Blofeld. For the record, James Bond has been contending with Blofeld as far back as the original Sean Connery 007 epics in the 1960s. Although we didn't see Blofeld in "Dr. No," we caught glimpses of him with his white cat in "From Russia with Love" and "Thunderball." Finally, Blofeld appeared in plain sight in "You Only Live Twice," "On Her Majesty's Secret Service," "Diamonds Are Forever," and "Never Say Never Again." We got a glimpse of him again in "For Your Eyes Only," but "Spectre" represents the first time since "Never Say Never Again" that Blofeld has stepped into the limelight. Oscar-winning character actor Christoph Waltz of "Inglourious Basterds" comes out of the shadows and confronts Bond late in the third quarter of "Spectre." Waltz makes a terrific villain, but Mendes and his scripters have short-changed him on screen time. Blofeld's final infamy sends Bond scrambling frantically in search of the plucky heroine at the old MI 6 building poised to be blown to smithereens. This ticking time bomb scene recalls the finale of the Sylvester Stallone movie "Expendables 3." Sadly, unlike a traditional James Bond movie, "Spectre" furnishes 007 with few ingenious gadgets. He is reduced to wearing a wristwatch that comes with an alarm clock bomb. Most of Blofeld's staff consists of executives or clerical staff, and Blofeld's gunmen are terrible shots. It is only when the end credits roll that we learn the name of Blofeld's chief henchman that David Bautista portrays. Mr. Hinx should have lasted longer than he does. Indeed, he should have shown up for the finale in the MI 6 building, so he could prevent Bond from escaping with Madeleine Swann.  Altogether, "Spectre" lacks sufficient spectacle to overshadow "Skyfall."Craig continues to prosper as James Bond (in possibly his swan song turn as 007 if rumor has it) and does so with a bang SPECTRE (2015) ***1/2 Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ralph Fiennes, Monica Bellucci, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Dave Bautista, Andrew Scott, Jasper Christensen, Alessandro Cremona, Stephanie Sigman (cameo: Judi Densch) Craig continues to prosper as James Bond (in possibly his swan song turn as 007 if rumor has it) and does so with a bang: out to avenge the recently departed M as well as confront the nefarious leader of the titular conspiracy group hellbent on sabotaging international security at any cost. Waltz is slimily evil as the notorious Blofeld and a continuing supporting crew for Bond including aces-up-his-sleeve Fiennes as the new M, spunky and sexy Harris as Moneypenny and crafty Whishaw as Q. Bautista's near mute turn as a brute echoing Robert Shaw's blond Russian thug of "From Russia With Love" and Richard Kiel's Jaws from Roger Moore's pair of flicks is indeed formidable and chilling. While there is little believable chemistry between Craig and new Bond gal Seydoux there is the little-used but always welcome sultry Bellucci to spice things up. Director Sam Mendes returns to the franchise pulling out all the stops including a one-take non-cut opening salvo pre-credit trek thru Mexico City's Day of the Dead ceremony with Bond tracking an assassin that involves a crumbling hotel and one helluva vertigo inducing chopper sequence. Fast, fun and fierce and by all means make sure to see it in a big-screen/IMAX venue just to invision an 80 foot high Bellucci :DNot Skyfall but Still Electrifying. Spectre (2015): Dir: Sam Mendes / Cast: Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ralph Finnes, Monica Bellucci: Sam Mendes scores again although not quite up to the level of his previous Bond outing Skyfall. This one regards the organization called Spectre that is responsible for terrible events but also has ties with agent 007 James Bond himself when he learns that the mastermind is related to him. Daniel Craig once again portrays Bond who is terminated by M when he undergoes a mission in Mexico on his own that results in an opening action scene that has him narrowly avoiding a collapsing building. Christolph Waltz plays the villain whose father helped raise Bond, and due to jealousy he killed his parents. This is one of Bond's most vicious enemies as he uses a machine to torture him that involves drilling needles into the skin. Lea Seydoux plays Dr. Madeleine Swann whom Bond swore to protect after her father commits suicide. Her father gave information to Bond beforehand that involved his former union with Spectre. Swann is a psychologist whom Bond will obviously fall for and race the clock in hopes of saving. Ralph Finnes as Bond's superior M realizes his mistake in terminating Bond and attempts to correct corruption within his own ranks. Monica Bellucci plays the sexy widow of an assassin whom Bond had brought down in the film's opening. With over the top yet blazing action sequences, this outing employs entertainment at its highest with an ending that could followup a sequel idea. In the meantime Bond gets the girl and the nifty sports car. Score: 8 / 10Poor plot. It seems like an Austin Powers movie Really poor plot!!! Just like an Austin Powers movie: 1) Bond discovers the villain is his brother  2) This bad guy decides to kick the table Bond is siting to announce his arrival, rather than just kill him. That becomes a huge fight in which Bond wins, of course.  3) The villain (his brother) decides to drill Bond's head just for fun rather than kill him.  4) The villain decides to detonate a building with Bond inside, what gives him 3 minutes to run, instead of putting a bullet in his head.  5) And, of course, he is always shagging the lady's before, during and after action.Leaves a lot to be desired My 6 out of 10 rating is solely due to the entertaining action and location shots- but even that felt short of what you'd expect. How could they spend so much money on a movie and come up with something so... lacking? The main issues arise from the lack of plot development, there wasn't a good flow and it felt disjointed at times, they never fully explored themes/back stories/relationships with any of the characters/implications of what was happening, it all seemed too condensed and contrived to work. I was willing to overlook the laughable script because it's only Bond, right? so a camp script is meant to be allowed.  Most of the time I forgot there was any plot line, I don't think there has been an effectively stylised (Daniel Craig's) 'Bond' film since Casino Royale, the ingredients of that film worked, perhaps Martin Campbell actually had a vision that he implemented flawlessly, whereas one could easily peg this as Sam Mendes' worst piece of work, almost as if they gave him too much money to care.  Give it a miss in the cinemas, (unless you are up for an action and there's nothing else decent on) I'd wait for it to come on sky movies, they don't deserve a penny more than they've already made!A marvellous piece of film! 10/10 - Bond IS back! If I was to review this movie properly, I'd be here for a long time! I'll shorten it down though... WHAT A MOVIE!  When SPECTRE was announced back in December of 2014, I was incredibly excited! All the hype and drama of my inner self when films like Skyfall and Quantum of Solace (although we won't discuss that film any further) had come back! However, I was worried it would not live up to its predecessor. Well I can tell you all now, it has!  SPECTRE brings the humour from the Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore days back; along with the glamorous locations and the exquisite cast! All the elements of a classic Bond film seem to have made it in this one! The humour, the locations, the women, the crazy gadgets, the top- secret villain lair, the villain himself (and must I say that Christoph Waltz' performance in this one was brilliant!) and of course, James Bond himself. I think this is one of Daniel's best performances as 007. Honestly, if you haven't seen this film, you need to!  But what about comparing it to the previous 3, I hear you ask? Well, aside from QoS, for me this is my new favourite Bond movie. Above Casino Royale... That's saying something. All the elements we want from a Bond movie are in this one; something Skyfall and Casino Royale lacked. 10/10! Don't know how they'll beat it... Well done Sam Mendes!Better than Skyfall, sorry critics! I really don't understand what the critics were smoking, in my opinion Skyfall was a good Bond film but very overrated and basically The Dark Knight with James Bond. Spectre in my opinion is far superior and finishes the overall arc of Daniel Craig's James Bond, depending on if he wants to make another or not. The music was great (apart from the Sam Smith theme), Acting, Action and story.  See it in IMAX, it's worth it even for the Mexico City opening scene alone!We are Living in GOOD TIMES (with regards to BOND) I'm a huge James Bond fan and there has NEVER been a truly bad 007 film. Big Thank-You to Barbara Broccoli (whose father Cubby would be truly proud) she helped bring 007 back with Dalton's superb two outings and then picked Brosnan (a popular choice and his first two films as Bond are a delight) and then she went for Daniel Craig...what??? who???  Well i was clearly wrong. Daniel Craig as James Bond has now proved to be a true match for Sean Connery (Wow! i never ever thought i would say that) and i hope should Daniel ever read this it will bring a smile to his face. If this is his final outing? then i can only say way to go Daniel, you nailed it and your place in 007 history is assured and cemented in pure 24 carat Gold. Thanks Daniel 4 GREAT Bond Films . I was wrong right from the very start with 'Casino Royale' (Barbara knew exactly what she was doing and the films have gone to a different level through these choices) From the Opening Sequence thru the Title Sequence (wonderfully imposing) and all the way to that ending!!! well if you gotta go? then better go out in style. This is a wonderfully stylish directed picture (Thanks for coming back Sam) and the script, story, origins :-) is again a little different to the normal Bond outings and i enjoyed it very much. The rumoured script from a number of years ago (which didn't make the screen) is accessed and makes for a tense edge of your seat thriller that has a lot going for it with some nice nods to previous bond films. There is a nice little in-joke with the 'Hasselblad' safe house (look the name up and you'll see it's relevance to the film) In my review of 'Skyfall' i said i hoped... 'We get the gadgets &amp; Bond girls back with some unusual locations &amp; some out-there villains &amp; plots to destroy the world again! We get those (i especially liked Blofeld's place) Monica Bellucci had been rumoured as a 'Bond Girl' for years and i'm glad she got the chance to finally appear, it's more of a cameo role really but it's a nice touch to have her here after all the rumours, a little older but still a truly beautiful woman. Lea Seydoux is the main Bond Girl, she does a terrific job, a lady that knows a few of Spectre's secrets and can handle herself (when needs be) and WOW! that shot of her in THAT dress on the train...stunning. Naomie Harris is already a favourite with me as Moneypenny and she's terrific here helping Bond's circle of rogues out, oh and yes another beauty. Ralph Fiennes as 'M' They sure can pick well and they got the right man to take over the reigns from Dame Judi. Ben Whishaw as 'Q' well it's a whole new world these days &amp; he's about as different from Desmond Llewelyn as you can get but it all works. (i still miss Desmond's Q though) Dave Bautista as 'Hinx' is one hell of a tough guy and massive with it but if i'm being honest this was a missed opportunity with him, he was imposing but it just didn't quiet work for me. Christoph Waltz as...well it says it in the cast credits here so i guess it's no surprise anymore (Blofeld) is i think very good, Blofeld was never a physical character and not very imposing (although the scar and bald head was a good look for a Bond villain) no Blofeld has always been more of a thinker and just simply a cruel man and so he is here, i liked him...and who knows? Every pound that was spent on this movie is right up there on the screen, the action sequences are thrilling as you'd expect but it's the tense storyline that takes us into nostalgic bond territory and it's all the better for it. JAMES BOND FANS can 'REJOICE' as it probably does not get much better than this! yes it's that good, everything you'd expect and hope from a 007 outing and more (Roger Moore...sorry couldn't resist :) i used to love those old cheesy Moore Bond trailers) BEST BOND Film EVER? Yes, No, Maybe, I need to see it again but upon this first viewing i was as thrilled watching it as i was seeing 'GOLDFINGER' (my favourite all-time Bond) for the first time. It's really good and I am simply fed up reading about those that rate this film a 1 and then try to justify it (just SAD) what in the world were they expecting? i know what i was expecting...and i got it and a lot more. Even the main music title track works better here than when i first heard it, it simply works with these credits! One thing i didn't like was the main poster design showing Bond in a white tux and him in the death mask behind, i honestly feel i could have done better (i do miss the old ARTWORK Poster designs of the 1960's/70's &amp; 80's) this having been said i must say the Advance poster version showing Daniel in his Live &amp; Let Die look with Black Polo Neck standing centre stage is rather COOL. It's GOOD TIMES for we James Bond Fans right now. 'SPECTRE' is a THRILLING film from START to FINISH and is every bit as good as SKYFALL (that one was wonderfully dark &amp; different from the normal Bond films) and this is different again to that one in that it's a RETURN to FUN and reminds me a little of the Connery &amp; early Moore era films. Get the POPCORN in &amp; ENJOY...BOND is BACK!Absolutely loved it! Skyfall, Casino Royale &amp; Spectre are my favorite bond movies! Daniel Craig is my absolute favorite bond. I love his presence, so modest, yet classy. He is 'James Bond'. I feel Sam Mendes has found his perfect subject with the bond movies. They together deliver such integrated bond story lines with such fluidity that it is amazing. The action scenes are mind-blowing. from the opening Mexico bombing &amp; helicopter maneuvers to the London finale is all explosive stuff throughout, and it gets better towards the end of the movie, in the last half an hour. Christoph Waltz as Obenhauser stands out, and is my favorite bond villain yet, only matched by Javier Bardem. When you meet him towards the end of the movie, you experience some magical moments between him and Daniel Craig. They are yin and yang. The perfect villain confronted by the perfect protagonist. Daniel Craig finally meets his match. Lea Seydoux was such a surprise as well. Beautiful, modest and so perfectly sorted for the role. Laudable performance by her. And Dave Bautista as the heavyweight side villain adds the perfect brute touch reminiscent of classic bond fare. An absolute must watch for all bond fans. Skyfall, Casino Royale and Spectre shall always be my favorite Bond Movies. You will be dearly missed Daniel Craig. I just hope I'll be as excited to watch future bond movies as I am when I watch him as Bond. But I am also very hopeful. After all these Bond movies just keep getting better, and that makes me a very happy person. SPOILER: The scene where bond escapes from the Spectre desert lair after the torture is spectacular, explosive stuff. One of the best action sequences I have witnessed, matched only in the explosive action scenes from 'The Dark Knight'Quintessential Bond. An excellent follow up to Skyfall. This is the polish, where Skyfall's blemishes of missing elements were fully covered. SPECTRE emitted the "Bond" feel, where Skyfall seemed to lack in some areas. Watching SPECTRE throughout, there was no doubt at any moment that there was any break in the "gentleman spy" character. In terms of other characters, Madeleine Swann was a great portrayal of a strong Bond girl, where she is an easy contender as a life partner for 007. Christoph Waltz played a very menacing villain, and given some time in British custody, his character would make for a great return with an even greater vengeance. Dave Bautista as Mr. Hinx was an incredible henchman; while not competing with the iconic characters of Oddjob and Jaws, he stands on the pedestal alongside the close second place candidate, Xenia Onatopp. Monica Bellucci delivered as an enigmatic and passionate widow, and even in a short amount of screen time. Andrew Scott played as a fine weasel of a character, as the head of the CNS. Overall, the action was satisfying, and I was never bored at any given time. Granted I am a very big Bond fan, I still find it more entertaining than some of the old films of the 60s, where some parts of those films were dragged out in unnecessary ways. I loved this film. Saw it two days back-to-back, and enjoyed it both times. There was an aura of elegance, high society and danger that ate through my Bond-loving heart throughout (Can't help but imagine how Pierce Brosnan or Sean Connery would do with this script). This film, however, makes me hold a VERY high expectation for Bond 25, even more so than I did following Skyfall. However the fate of Bond falls in the next two or so years, the story nonetheless ought to be good, casting flawless, and cinematography near perfect. Whether or not Daniel Craig returns, or let alone Sony continues to have the rights of distribution, 007 should have enough leeway to do what he does best.An excellent Bond movie I will explain to You why I liked this movie so much. Actually, except Casino Royale, I never cared about the restart of the franchise. But I can tell You one thing - Craig is the best Bond. Now, when this movie returned to the Formula of the Franchise, it is 10 out of 10, because everything is here: the Bond villain is now the classic one, the secondary villain like Jaws or Oddjob, the girls, the cars, the unbelievable explosions and shooting in an unimaginable way. But it is also a Craig movie. He is continuing his journey - the story, that begun in Casino is now at some point that we could call a great ending. But something tells me this is not an end... It's only a stop for a while...Just to make us take a breath...A Masterpiece A lot of people were worried about Spectre, and a lot of people disliked it.  After seeing it, I must say it has to be added to the classics along with Goldfinger, From Russia with Love, Octopussy, etc. Everything that James Bond is about and everything that a James Bond movie can be about: intrigue, gadgets, women, explosions, fights are in this incredible picture.  It is an absolute must see of our generation. Christoph Waltz again delivers on an incredible level and Daniel Craig is at his best James Bond. The leading ladies we find in Monica Bellucci and Lea Seydoux are all we could ask for in James Bond Girls.  The clichés that people worry about seeing in every other movie are perfectly added to Spectre and do not overpower the incredible plot.  There is a reason James Bond has had 24 movies to date and Spectre gives plenty of reasons to keep on having many more, hopefully directed by Sam Mendes and with music by Tom Newman.Superb Entertainment I'm not a lifelong James Bond fan by any means and didn't come to the franchise until Daniel Craig took over the title role. I've enjoyed all four of the Craig interpretations since. From the opening titles of Spectre with its creepy tentacle sex to the spectacular Day of the Dead in Mexico City, to the final scenes in London, this movie was just pure entertainment. It's not deep. It's not something I'm going to over-analyse. Craig is great: funny (if you like the British curled lip type of humour), fit as hell, vicious, credible. The action is almost non-stop. There a very strong retro feel to the movie: Bond's suits are incredibly 1960s, the interior of the villain's lair filled with G-Plan and Ercol if I'm not mistaken. The final shot of the whole movie is a nod to the franchise's iconic history. Personally I hope Craig does stay for another film. He is Bond for me. Great job.Spectre It was the best James bond Movie ever. All the sets were built amazing and the locations were amazing. All the actors were really amazing. The car was the most amazing car in James bond ever. The best film with Daniel Craig. The parade in Mexico city was also amazing with all the costumes. The best Bond movie Sam Mendes has directed. I loved the movie, its my favorite. No other Bond film can be this good. And only Sam Mendes can make an amazing movie like this. And only Daniel Craig can do such an amazing acting as he did. And the girls were also the best Bond girls. Beautiful and wonderful. Amazing actresses.Solid Contribution to the James Bond Films As a long time bond fan, as many of us are, I find this film paid a good homage to the earlier works and adds good quality lore to the story line of the whole series. This had good psychological elements to the story which underscores to be a spy one needs to not only be deadly but brilliant. The film fits well into what makes for a good bond film, tongue in cheek humor, colorful and insidious villains, high tech gadgets, and masterful action scenes among other things.Not quite Skyfall but that aside easily the best Bond in YEARS Excellent pacing, Great car chases, Great action sequences, Good drama, Not too much cheese, Brilliant nods to Bonds of old, Ties the Daniel Craig era up nicely. Did not feel like a 2.5hr film either. I would recommend any Bond fan see this film or any Bourne fan for that matter. The Bond girls in this film are also a lot better and more fleshed out than in previous Bonds. I just cannot fault Spectre! GO SEE!One of the Best Bond Movie Ever! I am a huge fan of James Bond movies. I loved this movie and truly enjoyed a lot. The movie is full of suspense action, drama and excellent stunts. This Bond movie is one of the best bond movie of all time and Director Sam Mendes did another masterpiece in his carrier.  Daniel Craig action sequences are astonished and he did a great job in his carrier. Lea Seydoux looks gorgeous and Christoph Waltz Villain Role is impressive. All the characters did their part very well ( Ralph Fiennes, Dave Bautista, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Monica Bellucci etc...) This movie is nicely connected all the previous Craig's Bond movies.The locations of the movie is visually superb and outstanding. The movie start to end is marvelous.  Finally the movie is worth watching movie for James Bond fans and others also...Not just one of the best bond films but one of the best films of all time Look at any franchise on the internet and you'll find, as soon as you hit the comment section, a war between keyboard warriors over what the "correct" interpretation of the main characters are. Unfortunately they are often listened to meaning they have, in a way, been responsible for the failures of some recent installations of various franchises. This is not a film that panders to those keyboard warriors, it's a film that has a story to tell and tells it perfectly. Spectre is clearly everything bond has been over the years; globe trotting, action packed, witty, cool, sexy with enough incredible outfits to make your own wardrobe look like a charity shop display and enough escapism to push the £10 ticket price to the back of your mind. However it also takes the best aspects of the previous three films and allows it to take ownership of James Bond. I'm talking, of course, about Daniel Craig's performance. After this film I find it hard to imagine that anyone (bar Connery) came before him. He's wounded but dangerous, vulnerable but guarded, ancient yet charismatic his interpretation of the character has become an iconic in this franchise. I would hate to spoil any part of this film for anyone reading this. Therefore all I'll say is the film seamlessly ties together the plot of the last three films and ends it with the feeling that Daniel Craig's Tenure is complete (if he wants it to be). The supporting players are fantastic; Rory Kinnear, Ralph Finnes, Naomi Harris and Ben Wishaw have all really grown into their roles and all have parts to play fitting to their talent. It's impossible to keep your eyes of the gorgeous Monica Belucci however her character's presence does make Bond's relationship with Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) seem inappropriate "come on James stick with the lady your own age!" Yet Seydoux is very convincing in the choice she gives Bond and I was completely with him in his reasons to consider it. Unfortunately Andrew Scott is fairly under used yet when on screen he perfectly depicts his Character C, as M put it "..a cocky little b*****d." Then we have Christoph Waltz who is so beautifully menacing you just want kiss him and then run a mile from him. Credit has to be given to the beauty in the execution of this film, how Sam Mendes has taken this far fetched theatrical plot and the nefarious villains and bought it to the 21st century is beyond me. He is a master of his craft and he clearly loves Bond as much as we all do. Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is a beautiful wonder partnered perfectly with Thomas Newman's Score. Even the most modern of films owes Bond. Look at the roof top chase in Bourne Ultimatum and tell me The Living Daylights hadn't beat them to it twenty years earlier. Where else, other than Inception, have we seen a man ski away from a Hi-Tech clinic with armed guards in chase? Does On her Majesties Secret Service spring to mind? Also any superhero film that has a disfigured villain with a mad ploy of world domination, 007 has been there and done that 24 times over. So if you're fan rejoice it's a superb addition to the franchise and a perfect fit for Craig. If you're not a fan you'll likely still love it because it's such an Amazing film. However if you're keyboard warrior stop typing and go watch this film, because it will make you realise that when it comes to the Bond franchise...nobody does it better.Spectre - One Of The Best Bond Films Ever In My Opinion [ warning contains a few spoilers ] . I'm relatively new to Daniel Craig's Bond , having watched the brilliant ' Skyfall ' I went and bought each of the recent 007 films . From beginning to end ' Spectre ' is...well , spectacular - possibly one of the best Bond movies ever , Sam Mendes has delivered his most stylish Bond film to date , I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it . The action sequences , the score [ the big band which accompanies the opening scenes is just wonderful and never misses a beat ] , the locations , the characterisation , everything is perfect . Daniel Craig has taken over the mantle of ' Best Bond actor ' for me , he is the quintessential assassin , he blends perfectly with Ben Wishaw's ' Q' with Ralph Fiennes doing an excellent job as Judi Dench's replacement . The humour is wonderful - notice the timing of Q and Bill Tanner's laughter coming to an end with just one glance from our hero when he is being mocked for ' bringing home one piece ' [ the steering wheel of the DB5 ] - ' Can you make any other bird calls ' Bond manages to let out before Blofeld pierces his skull with a needle - ' And now we know what C stands for - Careless ' [ my favourite line from Spectre ! ] . Spectre isn't without a small amount of criticism - Andrew Scott's ' Max Denbigh ' may be a little too similar to his ' Moriarty ' from ' Sherlock but nevertheless he still comes across as an adequate adversary for ' M ' - Dave Bautista's ' Mr Hinx ' may have forgotten his orders when he tries to kill Bond on the train [ if Blofeld did indeed want his half brother back alive ] but , so what , Bond Movies have always been about suspending our beliefs for little while , it's part of their charm . I personally would have liked to have seen more development of the underused Noami Harris as ' Moneypenny ' and Rory Kinnear's ' Bill Tanner ' .  Lea Seydoux as Dr Madeleine Swann provides the glamour and a sometimes unbelievable change of clothing [ suspend those beliefs now ] , she plays her part nicely eventually winning the heart and falling for our favourite agent - Christoph Waltz provides enough menace and psychotic charm as the ubiquitous Ernst Stavro Blofeld ' my mother's maiden name ' , hopefully it won't be long before he escapes from prison to haunt poor James once more [ the ending was set up nicely ] . This latest Bond film is over two hours in length but we are swept along at such a pace that it seems to be a much shorter offering - I'm truly hoping that the rumours of this being Daniel Craig's farewell to the Bond Franchise are just that , rumours - I simply cannot imagine Bond being played by anyone else - Daniel Craig is just getting into his stride , I'm certain Sam Mendes will get another two movies out of him yet , we can but hope - Spectre , for me has set the bar in Bond Movies , if it is to be bettered then Craig has to play James Bond - again [ please ] .Best James Bond Film Yet I know not many agree that this is the best Bond film but I think it is. I was very excited for this film from the moment I heard the title, I couldn't wait to see SPECTRE make a return. It is a perfect blend of ideas from old films with new ides. I loved how it linked all of the other Daniel Craig films together. It definitely made for an intriguing plot. Hearing how SPECTRE and Blofeld influenced everything that happened kept me glued to the screen. It made SPECTRE seem very powerful and threatening. I think Christoph Waltz put in an amazing performance as Ernst Stavro Blofeld. I thought he was menacing and mysterious. The torture scene he was involved in was incredibly tense and scary and worked very well. He was well backed up by his henchman (Dave Bautista) who was very much based on other famous henchman from previous Bond films. This film provides a satisfying end to the Daniel Craig era but does leave one more film as an option if he wants to do another. For the record I'd love to see one more with Craig going against Waltz. Overall I think this is a great film with some great action scenes, a great Bond villain and a great story line. Any long time James Bond fan should love the references to old films but that doesn't mean it can't appeal to new fans. I would recommend this film to anyone but it shouldn't be watched without watching Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall first.Excellent movie! What a great movie! The best Bond movie ever. The casting was so good and all actors acted well in their roles. Daniel Craig was awesome. I'll miss him as James Bond. The car used in the movie was also pretty cool. In the movie you can see the real meaning of the word 'SPECTRE'. The direction and screenplay both are awesome. Monica Belluci's stunning beauty pleased me and I enjoyed the full movie well. Along side with my friends. all James Bond movies has a class apart. Now I've watched all James Bond movies but this one is the best I watched. The James Bond looked more real in this movie. Everyone should watch the movie. Have Fun.I really enjoyed this movie I don't get all the hate of this movie. I understand if someone liked Skyfall or Casino Royale better, but I very much enjoyed this movie. I saw a lot of characters that I recognized from other places (BBC's Sherlock Holmes Moriarty and that awesome villain from Inglorious Basterds) I enjoyed the action. It wasn't perfect, and had weaker moments, but it was well worth the money watching it. Also, the scene in Mexico was awesome (if not realistic). It's worth the watch :)With Spectre and Craig, the real 007 finally returns I saw Spectre tonight and I only need one word ... MAGNIFICENT!!! James Bond is back. After the disastrous Brosnan era which nearly meant the end of the franchise, the reanimation of James Bond of course began with Daniel Craig as the new 007 in Casino Royal. What an entrance he made. The sequel Quantum of Solace unfortunately was a bit of a letdown but still way better then Brosnan. With Skyfall the producers made a tremendous comeback and now with Spectre the return is complete, 007 at his very best. Finally again a male M, Q, Moneypenny, gadgets but not too, shaken not stirred, humour, Spectre (of course) and the all time super villain ... Ernst Stavro Blofeld. In retrospect, the previous 3 Bond movies have been a gradual build up to this climax. Spectre is really old school James Bond but at the same time with a very 21st century twist. The very strong opening begins with a few minutes long single shot scene in Mexico City. Through out the movie, at certain points, Spectre really breathed the old JB atmosphere from the Connery and Lazenby era. Especially the scenes at the Hoffler Clinic in the Alpes, on the train and at the Blofeld HQ inside the crater strongly reminded me of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, From Russia With Love and You Only Live Twice. Also the title song scene with the specific references to Casino Royal, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall is something we already saw in OHMSS. I really have to compliment Sam Mendes on that. First with Skyfall and now with Spectre, he made 2 excellent Bond movies we had not seen in a few decades. And what about the different characters? Christopher Waltz plays a very strong Blofeld. A creepy, sadistic, megalomaniac madman. Very Blofeld worthy so to say. Dave Bautista is the good old bad muscles, a crossing between Robert Shaw (Major Grant in FRWL) and Jaws. Monica Bellucci and Léa Sedoux are two gorgeous Bond women. The only little disappointment I had, if there was one, is the really small part that La Bellucci has in the movie. I expected her to have a bigger role. Ralph Fiennes portrays a very convincing M in his first appearance and Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw are very satisfying as Moneypenny and Q. And for Daniel Craig's performance? That's quite simple. With these 4 Bond movies under his belt, he has definitely proved to be the one and only true successor of Sean Connery, still the best 007 ever. I really hope he's going to do a 5th Bond movie because I really can't think of any other actor (not Hugh Jackman, not Idris Elba, not Damian Lewis) who is able to play this part.best story in bond franchise This is a true vintage bond film that will be applauded by not just bond fans but all movie fans, the action is not as much as it was in skyfall but thats because this bond film focuses more on the story. You get the custom epic opening scene which in some way pays homage to the bond film "live and let die" True bond fans will understand, daniel craig shows a more vulnerable bond in this outing by doing something bond rarely does and thats trust people. thrown in some clever one liners this is by far craigs best bond film and with the 007 franchise finally got the rights back to use spectre and its interested party's there is never a better time for a new bond to take the reigns if daniel craig is leaving.the only complaint i have is there is too many light hearted comedy moments but overall its a must see. The past will always catch up with you and in spectre it catches up with bondBest action movie Daniel Craig once again prove it, that he is the best james bond than others. I know many people will not agree with me, but yet this is my perception and I think the next 007 star will be more better than daniel craig but the efforts and hard work of daniel craig will always be remembered. He is and always be my james bond in future also. Now about the movie is the scene which i like the most was the last one in which daniel craig and the best in the business BATISTA fight. Both stars had given there 100% in this movie. The bond girl was so sexy and why not every women wheather she is young or old always look damn hot with james bond.The Best Bond Movie of all time Watched Spectre Starring Daniel Craig(Cowboys &amp; Aliens) as James Bond/007, Ralph Fiennes(The Grand Budapest Hotel) as M Bond's New Boss , Dave Bautista(Guardians Of The Galaxy) as Mr.Hinx Oberhuasers Muscle ,Ben Winshaw(Paddington ) as Q Bond's Armorer an Assistant, Rory Kinnear(Quantum Of Solace) as Bill Tanner, Lea Seydoux(Mission:Impossible- Ghost Protocol) as Madeleine Swann my favorite Bond Girl. Naomie Harris(Pirates Of The Caribbean) as Eve MoneyPenny,Monica Bellucci(The Matrix Reloaded) as Luica Sicarra and Christoph Waltz(Inglorious Basterds,Django Unchained) as Franz Oberhauser/Ernst Blofield The films Main Villain. also the film is high octane thriller and it shows Why Global Surveillance is Wrong it also Linked The Previous 4 Bond Films Le Chiffre,Dominic Greene,Mr.White And Silva were all Part Of Spectre also I enjoyed That The Film Had Humor and wasn't Super Serious also amazing Production design from Dennis Gassner(Waterworld), Costumes Design by Jany Temime(Children Of Men),Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema(Interstellar),Score By Thomas Newman(Serenity), Screenplay By John Logan(Gladiator), Neal Purvis(Quantum Of Solace), Jez Butterworth(Live.Die.Repeat:Edge Of Tomorrow) and Direction from Sam Mendes(Skyfall ) 10/10British Wit and Charm, Excellent Cast, Delivers Enough to be Bond A lot of fun, confusing at times, but worth the ride. I love the characters, the bond series, and the plot formula. That said, the general themes and factors in the movie (such as the origin story, corrupt government officials, the evil shadow organization, and technology vs. manual labor) were conceived quite poorly. Very little character or story development. It left me with the feeling that a lot of explanatory scenes were cut out. The scene-to-scene transitions, the logical progression, the weaving of parallel sequences, et cetera, was also terrible.  Monica Bellucci, incomparable goddess, was given an utterly useless role, no arch and no drama. Her romantic scene made no sense and was as passionate as two mannequins being knocked over in a Black Friday mob; her character was superficial, unnecessary, and obviously the product of a lazy writer needing to push the story along. Her whole 3 minutes of the film was a disjunction and distraction.  Christoph Waltz, another brilliant and talented actor, was one- dimensional, predictable, and generic. The artificial hype of Waltz's power never rang true; his devices illogical and confusing, his dialogue wooden, his action scenes boring. None of this was his fault, bear in mind. He did his job well, but it was an "odd job", pardon the pun. Léa Seydoux seemed just as confused as we were. Her emotions fit the scenes like a foot trying to fit into a leather glove. Angry one minute, for no reason, then absolutely calm, for no reason. It's as if months passed between cuts in the same scene.  I feel sorry for everyone in this movie, except for Daniel Craig. He was solid, and he was Bond James Bond. The movie was worth seeing, 'cause everybody's gotta love 007, but go in with low expectations.  Jeffrey Rosenspan Daniel Craig and Sam Mendes Return to Give Us One More Excellent James Bond Film Let me say it. I want Daniel Craig to stay in this age and forever only play Jamed Bond every couple of years. I want that, please, give me that. For starters, I loved this movie. Spectre is intense, it has an awesome score, it is definitely one of the best looking movies of all time, all the set-pieces, oceans, places, all great. The cinematography is absolutely Oscar-worthy. Daniel Craig is once again so great as James Bond, so is everyone else in the movie... all-in-all, I'm pretty sure I'll be watching this another 20 times very very soon. (Though probably skipping the intro song... Bored out my mind throughout that one, bring back Adele!) Having said all that... if you are a fan of James Bond and you want to be simply entertained when one of his films comes around, I don't want to say anything that could possibly make you upset or worried about Spectre. Seriously, the film is great. The opening scene alone is one of the best intro's in a James Bond film ever.  I just had a couple of thoughts and 2 days after watching the film I want to share things that cross my mind.  See, the thing is that the previous movie was Skyfall. And Skyfall was for the most people the best James Bond film ever. So how do you try to top that? You don't. You go to a different direction. Spectre tried to do that, it actually worked for the most part, but unfortunately a lot of moments felt abrupt. Daniel Craig proved in all his previous movies (even in Quantum) he deserves the name of "James Bond". The new way he and Martin Campbell handled the journey of him becoming James Bond in Casino Royale was done extremely well. Then you walked into Skyfall, a much more personal movie, dealing with the past and serving a lot of nostalgic moments, both indoors and outdoors of the Bond franchise.  And then enter Spectre. It does try to change a couple of things (particularly bringing back some of the silliness and funny moments of previous Bonds), allowing Craig to have a bit more fun and less stress throughout a mission (also enter Mrs. Monica Belluchi at this point). But what is the problem? Well, it's not one, so to sum it up, while hoping not to spoil anything, I'll list them.  1) The villain. Spectre tries to deliver this unbelievably greatest villain of all time with this guy named Blofeld (played by the underused I felt Cristoph Waltz)... well, in the end it just felt like trying to top other villains.  2) The running time. Man, I just feel like it could have been so much better if it was like 20 minutes shorter. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind watching Daniel Craig wearing suits and jackets even for 20 hours, but the story didn't need it. Which brings me to my final point...  3) The Story. Spectre unfolds like the last page of a very good book that was completely rushed when it had to be finished. While it doesn't have to, it tries to piece together everything in this weird, supposedly smart and complicated way... I didn't get it. At least, not all of it. Perhaps it's just nitpicking. The sure thing is that I'm proud of Spectre. It comes at a time where most blockbusters try to blow everything up and only use superheroes and superpowers to bring excitement. Spectre is proof that you can still have all that fun and seriousness without anything being "super". Sam Mendes is a director definitely worth remaining in the action genre. I don't know if Daniel Craig makes another movie or not (I think one more is in his contract), I want as much as I can get. He knows the character, he has studied the character, he wears those suits so fine, he IS James Bond. I feel like whoever they choose to fill his shoes, will be a disappointment. Spectre is one more excellent movie in his Bond agenda and I'm sure I'll be forgetting most of its flaws pretty soon.  That's why it deserves a 9/10. Love you, Danny!A mind blowing movie. I have always used the impressive database on IMDb, but after seeing Spectre I had to sign up just to try and put into words what I think about this movie. I am not putting the spoilers as you may not have seen this. Better then Casino Royale and 100 times better then Quantum of Solace, it is perhaps not better then Skyfall, but it is equally as good. The beginning of the movie is incredible, scenes like that don't belong in average movies, only blockbusters. As a life long fan of the James Bond movies this is an excellent addition. It may be the last one for Daniel Craig, it felt like, but I hope for more. Star of the show is Q, he stole the scenes he appeared in. The best Bond villain for a long time.This ain't a bad movie! I watched this movie on DVD today &amp; i'm going to tell this: This movie ISN'T bad at all! Geddit? And yes, this IS the 1st Bond movie i've seen in my life, &amp; it was such a good movie. Buying the DVD for Php 550 is worth my money since i didn't see the movie during it's theatrical run. The action, plot, opening scene &amp; Bond's adventure are also good. If this is Craig's last time to play James Bond 007, i will miss him. :,( This movie is a blast, i think all Bond fans should watch this, even with ur family &amp; friends. Rating: 10/10 P.S.: If you hate Sam Smith's Bond song i respect your opinion. :)Where have all the Roger Moore s gone? There was a time where the bastion of comic book readers were they're intended audience of children and weird, overweight, problem dandruff sufferers with food in their beards. At some point, however, we have elevated these fun, simple characters to high art, thus advancing this new conspiracy to invent something which was never there.  It began with the post Burton Batman movies, carried on through a hundred other super hero movies which relaunched Robert Downey Jr's career, and have culminated with the destruction of our beloved vacuous misogynist, James Bond.  James Bond is a comic book, actually even less deep than that. His beauty is you never have to think about anything going on in any of his movies. Half naked girls, big explosions, stunts, and fast cars. Wonderfully honest and unapologetically shallow.  We loved James Bond. But this movie is not James Bond. I mean the Daniel Craig fits the role perfectly, no acting and a tight, tailored suit. Our Bond girl also fits the mole, kind of. She's pretty, doesn't talk too much, doesn't really do anything.  I guess when James Bond, such a simple formula, can go so completely off the rails, you have to wonder what this world is coming to. Do people in Asia watch these and take them seriously? Do they actually think there was ever any political or social commentary? This film would seem to indicate that people have thirsted for more, they have wanted to get to know the real James Bond. I am scrating my head wondering though, as I thought James Bond having no real basis was the whole point. What a horrible film.
More of the same This is the Mission Impossible format: Intro. Tom Cruise in the middle of a mission in some far away country fighting bad guys while doing unbelievable physical feats. 2. Tom Cruise receives a new mission he always accepts, 3. He then gets attacked by bad guys or framed by the organization who wants to destroy the world, 4. He meets hot interracial girl who always tries to kill him but he ends falling in love for her, 5. He sets up a team to find out the bad guy and usually to get what bad guy needs, 6. He trespasses some impossible place were humans cannot access and finds a way to get what the bad guy wants. 6. He finds bad guy with what he needs and never gives it to him and gets tortured in exchange(he can also get tortured at the beginning mission too). 7. He beats bad guy. 8. Team is happy and end of story. Facts Tom Cruise never dies and never gets badly injured. He always disables self destructing devices at the last millisecond. He is a genius who can crack any code, memorize anything and figure out any puzzle. He never rides motorcycles with a helmet. At least once in every MI movie he disguises as the bad guy or semi-bad guy.Christopher McQuarrie makes this the best entry in the series yet! Having seen the previous four 'Mission Impossible' films, I have to admit that none of them impressed me to the degree that I had hoped. I guess my expectations for action thrillers centering on secret agents were set too high because I saw the 'Bourne' trilogy and Daniel Craig's James Bond films first. The first three 'MI' films all seemed a little too slow, cheesy or convoluted on my first viewing. The fourth one was pretty good, even if the story does feel a little forgettable So, where does that bring me for the fifth entry of the franchise? My expectations were set at average around this time, despite all the good word-of-mouth I've been hearing. However, it wouldn't have mattered if my expectations were set around the same level for the latest 'Bourne' or James Bond film (very high) – 'MI:5' blew everything I'd expected from it and then some!  Where to begin? The film possible contains the biggest, and possibly best, story out if all the other installments. It is fascinatingly complex and dynamic – moving from country to country, dealing with characters who have questionable allegiances – all on top of Ethan Hunt trying to outrun the CIA while trying to get to the bottom of what the Syndicate really wants. It may seem like a lot, but the script is really well structured and paced. Even though the film does take a few liberties with how some of its characters will ultimately act in the end, the plot isn't nearly as predictable as one would make it out to be. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie also manages to squeeze in some surprisingly silly moments at the most random of moments. The action scenes in this film are also some of the best in this franchise. Soon after showing Ethan Hunt take off on the side of an airbus, the film kicks it into overdrive and delivers an adrenaline rush packed with REALLY well done car chases, okay hand-to-hand combat scenes (they're kind of choppy), and ONE very suspenseful, pulse-pounding scene involving multiple snipers. McQuarrie's direction over the editing of these sequences is incredibly nuanced – so much so that I found myself repeatedly leaning over the edge of my seat with excitement. People who weren't fans of the cheese factor (forced romances, convenient gadgets, and the overuse of face masks) of the previous films would be glad to know that it's been done away with in this film. And for people fearing that this is a film that takes itself too seriously, let me be one of the first to say: it doesn't. One may draw parallels between the events that have happened in this film to some of the recent events in our world, but I see it as a clever way for the franchise to keep up with our times. 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' is without a doubt one of the most exciting films I've had the pleasure of experiencing this year. It completely took me by surprise with how well-done it was, and should just about take anyone else to the same conclusion.Thank You! A Must See! All I can say is Thank You!!! This is what I want to see when I go to the movies looking to enjoy a good summer blockbuster!!! Man, talk about a fun ride. It was humorous, exciting, thrilling, suspenseful, and well worth the price of admission. Tom Cruise really gets it when it comes to entertaining your average moviegoer and he doesn't disappoint. But the truth is, no one disappoints in this summer flick. All parties brought their 'A' game and played their part perfectly. The female lead (Rebecca Ferguson) really held her own alongside Ethan Hunt and the crew and hopefully we'll see her in future installments, if there is more. Based on this current installment, there should definitely be more. MI:1 is a classic in my eyes and I've watched it countless times, but I must say, Rogue Nation...well, it's a lot more fun and I do feel it is a better film overall. I will be watching this one again and again. And don't wait for it to come to video...this is a movie you must see in theaters for the full experience. Also, let me just say the stunt sequences are thrilling...thrilling I say!! Very limited CGI in this film, which made the action scenes even more exciting and dare I say it again...thrilling! Lots of gasp worthy moments. I won't give away any spoilers as that would ruin the exciting action sequences and fun twists. This is enjoyable from beginning to end. So just go see it!!!Seen it all before I'm a fan of Tom Cruise and really like the last movie in the franchise but I couldn't get over the feeling that I'd seen it all before. Every hair raising stunt, every corner Ethan Hunt is backed into you just know he's going to win. The movie itself was good but for me it seemed a little stale. The action sequences were huge and impressive but it just seems that Hunt is indestructible. He can ride one of the fastest super-bikes in the world and crash without a helmet and the guy doesn't even get a gravel rash! I know other people are loving it so don't let my lack of enthusiasm put you off going to the cinema to see it. It's certainly worth the ticked price.Decent but not one of the best MI movies This is another decent addition to the Mission Impossible series but it wasn't one of the best. It's missing the two most important ingredients: 1. Interesting characters, especially bad guys (think Vanessa Redgrave in MI or Philip Seymour Hoffman in MI3). I hate to say it but Tom Cruise is easily the best actor in Rogue Nation. 2. Thrilling set-pieces (the break-in scene from MI, or the skyscraper scene from Ghost Protocol). Rogue Nation's underwater security hack just didn't quite cut it for me. Aside from that, it is a perfectly good spy/action flick. The fights are good. Ethan Hunt and Lane (the bad guy) keep outwitting each other in a pretty decent plot. But it didn't grip me like some of the other MI movies have.This franchise just keeps getting better and better! You would think that after five films this would have become a tired premise, but the way that it takes on the spy genre as both an intelligent espionage thriller as well as a big-budget blockbuster makes it even better than the new James Bond films.  It's exciting, slick, cool and fun, but this series, most of all in this film, has got an amazingly inexhaustible energy to it that makes it so brilliant. Let's start, then, with the main attraction of this film: the action. Simply, it's stunning. There are five separate big action sequences here, each lasting around ten minutes more or less, and they are all high-octane thrill-rides that never let up and make this such an entertaining film. Tom Cruise proves once again that he's a blockbuster star like no other, giving his all in the action here, whether it's attaching himself to a plane, jumping in a chasm of water or riding a superbike through the desert (in what was, in my opinion, the greatest, most exhilarating car chase ever). On that note, actually, the incredible bike chase is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the great action, but credit has to go to director Christopher McQuarrie for excellently turning this into a good-looking and intense action thriller, using great camera work (avoiding shaky cam) to make it so brilliantly entertaining. Away from the stunts, this film has still got a very good plot to it. There are few blockbusters that couple great action and intelligent storytelling nowadays, but this really bucks that trend, because it's absolutely enthralling to follow from start to finish. There are betrayals and deceptions galore in this spy thriller, as well as a genuinely exciting climax, which is so unpredictable that it makes you forget about the generic plots of the less successful films and be properly engrossed in the current story. Finally, this is also a very nice film to look at, thanks both to McQuarrie's direction, as well as the beautiful sets and landscapes that this is set in all over the world.  From the mesmerising desert of Morocco to the foggy alleys of London, this is a global journey that goes even further than the previous films, and comes out with a stunning result, the best of the series in my opinion! www.themadmovieman.comHighly Entertaining After another operation breaking the protocol, CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) decides to shutdown the IMF. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is trying to prove the existence of the evil organization The Syndicate but he captured by his agents. However he succeeds to escape with the help of mysterious Syndicate agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). Trapped in London, Ethan requests support from William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) that tells him that can not do anything to help him since the IMF does not exist anymore. The lonely Ethan decides to follow his only lead, the rogue Syndicate agent Lane (Sean Harris). A couple of months later, Ethan summons his friend and former colleague Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) to go to Austria to help him since he believes the Syndicate will try to assassin the Austrian Chancellor during the opera Turandot. Ethan saves the Chancellor from three snipers but he is killed by a bomb in his car. One of the snipers is Ilsa that gives a lead of Lane's scheme to Ethan. Who is the agent Ilsa Faust? Will Ethan be capable to prove that the Syndicate does exist?  "Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation" is a highly entertaining action film. The fast-paced development of the plot does not give time to think and the viewer sees a very enjoyable film. The unknown Rebecca Ferguson has a beautiful face and performs a key character that will be on the next movie of this franchise. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "Missão: Impossível - Nação Secreta" ("Mission: Impossible - Secret Nation")Mission ACCOMPOLISHED! Me and a friend again had the opportunity to see an early screening of the movie 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation'. One word. Excellent. Everything about that movie was just perfect! It had the right amount of every element that would make a movie simply brilliant! This sequel for me, was definitely the best Mission movie yet. And at the same time it recalls so many details from the first mission impossible movie. And most of all the action. WOW. Every action scene in this movie was breath taking and there will be moments when you would just want to get up and start clapping. They did a good amount of the stunts without CGI and that will make you appreciate the action even more. Oh and if you thought that plane scene in the trailer was crazy, then you are in for a treat! When it comes to acting, Tom Cruise easily convinces us that he is a top notch agent of IMF(Impossible Mission Force). This time every member of the team has something to give in comparison to Ghost Protocol. Kudos to Simon Pegg for his impeccable timing for humor. And the villain was perfect! They made the villain perfect for the IMF and the ending of this movie is so satisfying. One of the few movies where the ending just pleases you so much. On the whole, Don't miss this movie!! Seriously.. Don't! It is a movie mean't to be watched by everyone!This Is What An Action Film Should Be I saw this film on an IMAX screen and I'm glad I did. Although IMAX cameras were not used in the filming, I think the larger screen creates a more immersive experience and the sound was spectacular. But this film would be great in any format. "Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation" is one of the best action films I have ever seen. The story is clever and action packed. The photography is amazing and the music is fantastic. Much has been made of the stunt work, especially that done by Tom Cruise himself. It did not disappoint. And the action and chase sequences are as exciting as any I have seen. We can thank the writing for the well-defined and engaging characters. Some Bond films have villains that are rather cartoonish, but in MI:RN the danger feels real, helping to drive the suspense. The female lead, Rebecca Ferguson, deserves special mention. Her portrayal of Ilsa Faust is a wonderful blend of intelligence, beauty and strength and definitely one of the best in any action film. I can only hope she shows up in the next installment. some of the credit goes to the writers who created the character. In all, this film offers everything you want in an action film and deserves a "10" for its place in the genre.Quite predictable, pretty unrealistic and still very enjoyable. Quite predictable, pretty unrealistic and still very enjoyable. That being said, this movie is everything you can expect it to be. Quick and interesting action and even if you can predict what's gonna happen next (sometimes precisely to a second) you still will enjoy seeing how they made it happen. As for acting: Rebecca Ferguson's lovely, Simon Pegg'g good, Ving Rhames Jeremy Renner and Simon McBurney are adequate for their characters, and Tom Cruise... well he's the way he is, if you love him you'll love him here and if he annoys you... ;) All in all it's an action movie and if that's what you expect than you surely won't be disappointed.Entertaining without being over the top! TL;DR: Visually stunning, action filled and down to earth action sequences (no over the top BS). Storyline with nice twists and pretty good for an action movie, though watching Ghost Protocol helps getting to know the IMF crew (there's no introduction this time around). **spoiler-free** Rogue Nation, like the latest movies in the franchise and others in the spy/action genre, starts with a small crew, with little support, against huge odds, having to deal with challenges that seem impossible (no pun intended).  What makes Rogue Nation better than most is that it makes it all plausible without super-human characters, crazy gizmos (except one that I shaw not mention, but it is not overused like in M:I II), and brilliantly made down-to-earth action sequences. The latest 007 movies are following the same ideals, but M:I has made a solid choice of supporting actors (specially Simon Pegg) that add a subtle layer of comedy and improvisation, which helps a lot into building some suspense in the audience - it feels like as if they are as clueless as we are of what is going to happen. Another great aspect that sets this moving apart are the terrific action sequences which are paired with outstanding sound effects and music score (without spoiling, there is an entire action sequence that plays with this very aspect). Was lucky enough to watch a pre-screening on IMAX, and strongly recommend watching it on IMAX or a theater with a good audio setup.  The storyline, while not hard to follow, benefits from having watched at least Ghost Protocol, since key characters are back and lack some introduction, and the story somewhat picks from what took place in the last instance. Much like Ghost Protocol, the storyline packs some interesting twists and doesn't seem obvious - even though we all know that the good guys win, Rogue Nation adds some shady characters which are not as black and white, making for some interesting development. Overall a highly entertaining movie, packed with stunning action sequences and a storyline that is well thought-out and manages to keep the audience hooked until the end. A solid addition to the franchise that keeps one-upping itself on every new release.Most Explosive MI, Yet. Even two hours won't be enough for "Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation'" to be able to unravel all its exhilaratingly high-octane action and drama. This fifth installment in the franchise surges with death-defying action proceedings, riveting and pulsing with the relentlessness and explosiveness of its spiking adrenaline, to deliver the franchise's most thrilling outing, yet. That relentlessness is true and screaming right at the opening sequence of the film, where IMF agent, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), is seen dangling from the door of an airbus, already adrift in the air as it ascends even further to the skies. That's the first of too many, and you wouldn't care less of the logic behind such impossible knockout stunt demonstrations, because once the momentum crashes past the speedometer's limit, there's no other choice left but to get consumed by the electrifying influx of near-impossible action setpieces. This doesn't mean there's barely any sense to take in, in fact you would be awed to realize that in spite of its speed and strength-defying physicalities, characterizations are still working along the explosive chaos, and the behavior of the characters, and the emotional aspect of the narrative, still follows acceptable reasoning. The whole of 'Rogue Nation' can be seen as Hunt's team desperate attempt to keep IMF running, and save it, and the world it intends to protect, from extinction. This time, the major figure of terror, is the mysterious organization, 'The Syndicate', headed by the despicably steel-fisted Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) . Ethan is joined by co-IMF agent, William Brandt (Jeremmy Renner), and suspicious British agent, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). The comic effort comes mostly from Hunt's sidekick, Benji (Simon Pegg), and Brandt, who spends most of the time running and chasing after the shadow-terrorist group, The Syndicate. Much of the movie's strength emanates from its seemingly unstoppable delivery of edge-of-your-seat action, but you can't ignore the grandeur of its camera shots and the palatable efforts of its lead characters and supports. There's much to say about how inconsistent and illogical some of the narrative choices that the screenwritersn took are, but they get overshadowed by the more relevant, and on this case, more effectively utilized, high-tension action extravaganza. One can inevitably notice how Cruise has aged through the franchise's almost two-decade history. He's more tired-looking here, but you can't question his commitment to the franchise. In 'Rogue Nation', he's definitely back, running after, and wrestling against, the equally desperate claws of 'The Syndicate'. He hops across the world to trump the enemy, and in every city, he inevitably gets himself involved in deadly strangulations. At such moments, cinematography is top notch, and the breathtaking panorama becomes an exquisite backdrop for the ever-imminent rumbles. This is where this installment is strongest and most engaging, a strength that should warrant a sixth outing.Superb experience &amp; 2nd best movie in the franchise Almost a masterpiece. It contains everything you love about the movies. Suspense, mystery, drama, intelligent action &amp; plot. I did not expect the experience I got. A start to finish thrill ride which also contained intelligent characters &amp; plot. Christopher McQuarrie has crafted a superb movie which moves at a fast pace but also slows down when it has to for some intelligent character interaction. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances &amp; is in almost the entire movie. The rest of the cast are all great. Rebecca Ferguson is a strong character &amp; female equivalent of Ethan Hunt. Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner &amp; Alec Baldwin all give great performances &amp; have about the same screen time. The villains lead by Sean Harris are effective &amp; chilling &amp; also a little mysterious. Music is superb with many subtle bursts of the MI theme. The film does not contain hardly any CGI its nearly all practical real stunt FX. Overall it just works from start to finish &amp; Christopher McQuarrie has created a superb film experience which does not fail to entertain &amp; deserves repeat viewings to enjoy the experience again &amp; again. This mission should you chose to accept it is to enjoy the movie &amp; watch it at least once more at the cinema the way its intended to be seen on a massive screen with loud sound.Don't believe the hype, the worst sequel by far Saw it in the theater yesterday, couldn't wait for it to finish. Became very boring half way through, the plot is just childish and lacks any credibility or seriousness. I know this should be a no-brain summer flick, but M:I films always go for the shocks and suspense. It was non-existent here, the lack of any seriousness meant that nothing really moved me. Even the high-profile figure being assassinated didn't really mean anything because it seems that the whole world forgot about it the second after it happened.  The first film had a somewhat complicated plot, a few really breathtaking scenes and Tom Cruise young enough to deliver a fresh performance. The second film had a really silly plot, but the no- CGI motorcycle chase scene and Limp Bizkit soundtrack at least created some legacy. The third installment had a forgettable plot, but a really convincing bad guy played by the late Mr. Hoffman. The fourth film was silly enough, but the Burj Khalifa stunts made by Tom Cruise really stood out. This sequel has none of that. It relies purely on CGI and no plot development, it seems like characters jump from place to place without any motive or any explanation. I am aware of the fact that this lazy approach sells tickets these days, but in order to have a mission impossible really be a mission impossible it needs to have a context where it really seems serious and impossible. People who watched the first sequel remember that the Langley heist was introduced to the audience, planning was made and execution was slow, but exciting. This director could not deliver any of that.  I hope they stop now, I guess in the next sequel they could go into space or make Tom Cruise might fight a tiger in a cage. Even if he does it will be a CGI tiger, or a CGI Tom Cruise. In a CGI cage, with CGI blood. Big disappointment, really.liars on IMDb I went last night 8/7. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because chase credit card has a buy one get one free movie ticket on Fridays. Why everyone is raving about this bore shows people are paid to write reviews. How can anyone say 10 out of 10. MI 1 was and still is the best one of the franchise. The airplane scene? Big frigging deal why is that everyone's high point. It was 2 hours and 10 mins too long should of been a 1 hour 25 min movie. Was so drawn out. There was laughable scenes when cruise gets out of the car that had just flipped 10 times at 100mph. When he crashed the motorcycle with no helmet at 120mph he gets up with no damage like the terminator after being shot 20 times.  Save your money unless you get a buy one get one movie pass like I did. My chick and I walked out 1hr and 35 mins in. We couldn't take it anymore. The audience actually laughed a few times during this. Why? There was no comedy in this. A monotone bore. The first hour not 1 action scene after the stupid plane one in the beginning. I went out to a rock concert after that was more entertaining than this drivel. Some others walked out as well. The only good thing was the sour cream and chive popcorn and the fact the theater sells alcohol to numb the pain of this movie. San Andreas was better. On that note I'm off to play Xbox 360. It's more entertaining than this lame flickHere we go again... again I remember when I first saw this film in theaters and the lights dimmed the first thought that ran through my head was "Here we go again" as I released an involuntary sigh of apathy. Somewhere along the line, before seeing this latest installment, I had decided to re-watch the original four films and realized that the character of Ethan Hunt really has no defining characteristics beyond just basically being Tom Cruise. This bothered me for some reason. Jason Bourne was a fully fleshed out character and even the new Bond films had added newer elements to give a traditionally stereotypical character more depth and complexity, but Ethan Hunt is just...bland. He has no personality. What seemed even stranger to me was the fact that Mission Impossible was supposed to revolve around a team, yet Tom Cruise is seemingly always the only one who ever does anything. So basically these films boil down to watching Tom Cruise perform his own stunts, which I will admit are extremely impressive, especially in this latest escapade. However the plots of all five films are basically nonsense to try and connect each elaborate stunt to the next. Then I realized that all 5 films have remarkably similar story lines as well. Tom Cruise has a mission, something goes wrong, he goes rouge, needs to find some kind of MacGuffin, the villain is some kind of terrorist arms dealer, insert random forgettable love interest here, big stunts, the end. that being said, the film's action scenes are amazing, and really make you question the sanity of Cruise, who needlessly continues to insist on doing all of his stunts. Basically it's another Tom Cruise Hollywood blockbuster, which at the end of the day made me finally realize, "Why was I ever expecting anything else in the first place?"Best MI yet. Mission impossible Rouge Nation is directed by Christopher McQuarrie and stars Tom Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson, Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg. Most of the time when a series gets to its fifth movie, they ether have to reboot it some way or its just very bad but the mission impossible is not doing that, it is improving and getting better and better. Rouge nation might be the best MI movie yet, what makes it so great is that it takes parts of the other movies and puts them together. Rouge Nation adds more humor, more gadgets, more suspense, more everything. The acting was fantastic by everyone. Tom Cruise was amazing and the fact that he does all his stunts, just makes him one of the best action stars today. Simon Pegg stands out a lot in this one, they gave him more screen time, which is great because the chemistry between Cruise and Pegg is also great. The action was incredible and you could tell the actors were very doing it. Overall Rouge Nation was amazing and improved in everything. The action and acting was fantastic. Definitely needs to be seen in IMAX.Mission mediocrity - Ho hum; seen it all before. I don't understand why people seem so enamoured by this. It's like a made for TV James Bond on a bad day. Ethan Hunt isn't interesting. IMF isn't interesting. The first half was okay, but it soon degenerated into mediocrity. Too many characters, too many locations; no central focus or essential core. It wasn't really about anything. And the end; what a cop out. The writers just had to find a way to finish it; it felt rushed. I was bored with this film; it really wasn't great. And like MI:3 the music sucked; just noise pollution. Were any of the Mission Impossible movies ever that good? I don't think so. Just another movie to soon be forgotten about. Watch James Bond instead. Mission mediocrity.A Waste of Time and Money Saw the movie last Saturday, we both fell asleep during parts of the film. The length was too long and the dialog nearly incomprehensible. A terrible end to what was a good set of sequels. The opening scene was too staged and no clearly defined plot. Was that goof ball trying to open the doors did he not know Russian and on a mission inside of Russia! Unbelievable to say the least and not suspenseful or exciting in any form. The dialog between actors was so stilted as to be boring which causes us to nod off more than once during the film. MI in the past were not only exciting but kept you in suspense until nearly the very end, none of that this time around.Your mission should you choose to accept it... is try and not to fall asleep! Went to see it last night, after looking forward to it, but unfortunately I have to say that it is probably one of the worst MI films to date! The film virtually has no storyline that you can follow or make any sense from, relies on ludicrous stunts and action sequences and seem to full of more technobabble than an ST:TNG episode! Acting, whatever there was, was wooden and one dimensional. Even Tom Cruise/Ethan Hunt's bright shiny teeth couldn't save this film, you would have thought all he to do was smile and the villains would have been stunned, job done! Simon Pegg tried pull of a straight role, but seemed to look blank as confused as much as the audience. The film's main villain, was typically one dimensional, all he needed was a cloak and evil laugh then he was set. Unfortunately I cannot delete the film from my memory as easy they did with the stolen data. Also looks like we have another MI film to look forward to, looks like Tom Cruise is trying to beat Hugh Jackman's &amp; Robert Downey Jnr's record for playing the same character in film series, unlike them he has to rely sacrificing a decent storyline to do it. Just another excuse to get as much blood out of the stone while they can.How is MI5 not rated a zero? This is the first review I have ever done on IMDb...not because I don't like watching films..in fact, I adore films. Rather, I normally don't review just because I put a premium on my time, and don't want to spend time repeating what others may have already said about a given film; until today, that is. In my inaugural review, I was very motivated (I mean incensed) to write this review now having come back for the cinema, freshly infuriated in the realization that I can't get 2.5 hours of my life back after watching MI-5. I read glowing reviews before going to the film, to which I am now wondering if I saw the same film others who reviewed this film as "highly enjoyable". I am beyond puzzled how this film got good reviews, unless it is from reviewers who get easily bamboozled by special effects to forgive the need for a plot, or work for the makers of the film, or who are not of this earth. The planet to which these people who did liked this poor excuse for a "film" I do not know. Yes, I knew it would be an action film, and yes I knew one has to suspend disbelief to enjoy a film like this, but despite these prerequisites being in place in my mind going into the theater, this film content was so vacant and vapid it boggles my mind that I sat through its entirety and didn't walk out mid-film. The plot was not in the slightest way possible to follow, and the reviewers shouldn't confuse plot complexity (which a good story can have)with the nonsensical incongruity of this film. Tom Cruise--who was truly outstanding in Jerry Mcquire,the Firm, Vanilla Sky and Eyes Wide Shut-- was hardly that as an international spy. Mr Baldwin--another outstanding actor and wonderful in the Royal Tannenbaums and Blue Jasmine--but his role in this film was completely under-utilized. The other actors were alright, but its just that the plot and its presentation was just insulting to any intelligence. Endless product placements for BMW, and then when the locale of different places were indicated when they showed in an areal pan shot its a bit much to say show the US Congress and Washington Monument, combined with the need to type in the upper right corner..."Washington D.C.", just to make it look official and inform us that we are in Washington D.C. just in case one didn't know..I can't remember if the pan shot of Big Ben was accompanied by the words "London, England". If you are looking for a similar action/conspiracy spy film with slick international intrigue with believable characters, I highly recommend "The International" out a few years back. In sum, please, save your time, stay at home and watch paint dry for a more redeeming experience.Action Overkill, holed up plot, mediocre script...all in all felt like they should have given it more time. When it comes to entertainment, Tom Cruise is the one guy you can count on. His last release, Edge of Tomorrow, is a spectacular example of intelligent entertainment, with not a dull or lifeless moment in it. The last MI was the best action flick of the year. The reason it worked so well was that none of the action was forced and everything seemed to be in a flow.  Not so much in this one. Even the most publicized stunt, with Cruise hanging on the airplane in mid-air seemed too hurried and poorly executed. The plot seemed repeated and predictable.IMF in trouble, Ethan is the lone wolf..the one man army, throw a sexy female agent and a villain who talks funny, too many Beemers, multiple intelligence agencies with secrets of their own, and there you have it ! The only thing constant in the film was its flaws. Hunt running down a narrow pathway while a guy shoots him from behind with a machine gun from point blank range and ...guess what. Misses! The same with the bike chase scene. Too forced and too clichéd. The casting was pretty much the same. New women, same guys, a villain so big that he controls major international happenings and disasters, can start wars with his actions, yet personally goes to murder a movie store clerk cum IMF sub agent while exposing himself to the 'living manifestation of destiny' ( cant believe that was an actual piece of dialog, uttered by the wasted Alec Baldwin). The only standout was Simon Pegg as Benji ' when the cuss am i gonna get to wear a mask' Dunn. The action in some scenes was mindblowing. The underwater scene was done well. Rest all ranged from mediocre to rubbish. McQuarrie and Cruise have had some fruitful collaborations in the past. Edge of tomorrow, Valkyrie, Jack Reacher all good movies. MI5 is the odd one out i guess.  Hope they come up with something new next time, not like this recycled James Bond wannabe mediocre-fest.Familiar Franchise Fare, but Flashily Ordinary Rogue Nation delivers set piece action and thrills to satisfy most of the intended audience, but basically they are rather hackneyed and fourth rate. They do not make up for the acres of empty space at the heart of the movie's plot and characterisation. Let alone the script and direction which are utterly predictable and gone through strictly by numbers. A just about good enough film that does not try too hard. After all, predictability is the key to a franchise success, or a dreadful bore to the uncommitted and unenthusiastic - there really is only an hour's TV episode material here. True, it carries it all off with gloss and panache, but then the Chinese backers would want to be sure on a return for their investment! Tom Cruise (looking older) gives his all-American, polished, believable performance we come to expect in his action genre films, while the support cast do their thing like moving wallpaper. Rebecca Ferguson flaunting her slightly heavy thighs at almost every opportunity is an interesting choice as the femme fatale (good or bad?), but Swedish/UK cool does not add a lot to a very clichéd role. Sean Harris (unrecognisable) tries to method act the chief villain and still manages to make no impression. Just like Philip Seymour Hoffman in an earlier MI, you have to chew a bit of scenery rather than stay cold at a very great distance! Can we have a franchise-free (particularly comic-based ones) and Matt Damon not lost in space year of movies, please, and get back to some straightforward, effects-free entertainment that Hollywood used to do so well!?An awesome experience! My most anticipated movie of this year and luckily enough, I had the pleasure... the utmost pleasure of watching it at an advance screening! Loving Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol so much that I'd given it a near perfect rating, I was skeptical and expecting at least a bit of a letdown as I simply couldn't see how they'd top that. Also, I had only limited myself to 2 trailers as I already felt I knew far too much, which only increased my anxiety. Still, I couldn't help but have expectations; my excitement level had peaked before even going into the cinema! And the movie surpassed my expectations; just blew me away... multiple times. The best elements from all the previous four films are adapted and have been vastly improved upon. Sean Harris is the antagonist and he does a fantastic job of it. Cruel, mysterious, calculating, manipulating, menacing... just evil to the point that Hunt is at the end of his wits, feeling helpless. His luck seems to be running out... his skills, his way of operating, all his usual tricks and methods - they've all been exhausted and you are actually scared for him! The way this movie is presented to us, the audience, we aren't just viewing it; it's made to feel just as much of an experience. That's how the whole film is and I am in awe of the ingenuity. Just when you think you've got it all figured out - how the scene and then the movie are gonna play out, it twists &amp; turns and throws you off. And then, in the back of your mind, whilst taking in all of this unexpected awesomeness, you're off again... trying to figure out where that shot and the entire film is headed. It just takes you on an exhilarating ride. For the most part, the movie feels so perfectly realistic even with all the crazy awesomeness going on. And I love how unpredictable it was. In regards to the characters in general - actions taken by them, the pieces of dialogue they speak with everything occurring in the background and taking into consideration everything that has happened so far you find yourself being uncertain what their motivations and intentions are, what they're thinking, what they are going to do next, what's going to happen, what's the plan, etcetera etcetera – every character; not just the new ones but even the previously established ones. That is how exceptional the performances are, in tune with the direction of the story... the entire cast has their A game on! Also, there's a lot of humour, scattered all over the movie and that makes the movie more fun. There is development, too, with most of the characters - especially Hunt. The action in the movie is just insane... they went all out! From stunts to fight sequences and chases - absolutely sensational; it's like you're feeling every hit and every move. The whole scene where Tom Cruise actually clings onto the door of a plane while it's taking off - my heart was racing so fast. It was very well shot and the fact that he actually performed the insane stunt adds to the feeling; CGI just cannot compare. This intensity and excitement is constant throughout the movie, on some level. Also, Tom Cruise is riding a motorcycle once again and it is sweeeeeeeeeeeet! There's a scene of him running, as well, as usual. The cinematography is just spectacular and quite literally breathtaking throughout the film. Be it action sequences, landscape, anything... there's amazing wide-angle shots, there's POV shots that feel like you're really there, the whole lot. The movie looks and feels so great. The gadgets and gear in this movie are unreal! I don't mean they are unrealistic; they are believable in a very plausible-in-the-future way, creative and incredible.  There's more than a few things going on in the movie, yet none of it feels forced or unnecessary and it all works together very well. It runs at a tense, thrilling and suspenseful pace - in an enjoyable way. Not a single moment is wasted; every scene on the screen is essential and every shot is impeccably acted, directed and delivered. I could go on &amp; on about how every little aspect of the film was awesome, but to conclude, I loved it all. Also, TOM CRUISE IS A GODDAMN LEGEND!Boring I really enjoy MI series, however this one felt like it was missing all the things that make it interesting. I miss the comedic scenes, the suspense that is mixed with humour, the interesting gadgets that help get you into an impossible place also the interaction between the team members also absent. In the end I felt I could have watched the British woman all day, and had no interest in anything else, the rest was irksome. Do NOT waste your money to buy or go to the cinema just wait until its on TV and the adverts/commercials will give you more suspense!! Bottom line: Its the worst in the series!An ActionFest Flick - Shame The Story Wasn't As Good As The Stunts... This is an all-out actionfest. Right from the opening you've got Cruise (Ethan Hunt) holding onto the side of an aeroplane as it takes off - Bloody Nutter! This in most films would be the top stunt; this, of course, is MI so it's just your opening salvo of insaneness. It's the story which kinda lets it down. These have now become secondary to the stunts, which I have to say are superb - and not too much CGI (except for the tech stuff, that is). Here you have a secret organisation called The Syndicate (nope they don't rig the lottery). But as "syndicate" describes a group working towards an aim, then the name is wrong as it turns out to be one man controlling his own mercenary army. I think there would have been great scope had it actually been a syndicate with many heads like the hydra. There are a couple of holes in the story though they are minor... except for the ending... just how did the bad guy NOT think the scenario would turn out this way. Bit of a let down as he'd been ahead of Hunt and his team all through the film. In fact, the way Lane (Sean Harris) manipulates people is pretty awesome and is a good plot builder and twist creator. It's this element that keeps the story interesting. But in the end, Hunt has to overcome... it's just a shame that the ending wasn't as twist orientated as the rest of the story. I cannot fault the direction or the pace of the film, as McQuarrie, gives the audience an atmospheric and excitement filled rollercoaster ride of a movie. He is great at filming the fight scenes and chases as well as the drama set-up acting scenes. For example the car and bike chase between Hunt and Ilsa Faust (Ferguson). When Hunt's car crashes he slows down the action to build tension... and then to build to a comical end to that scene, before revving up the torque to near maximum for the rest of the chase. In fact, it's Rebecca Ferguson (Faust) that adds Kudos to the cast. She gives a fantastic performance as a strong-minded and deadly woman who happens to be beautiful and sexy to boot. She even has an air of secrecy and mystery to her. You are never too sure about her or her motives. This in some way is told by the story but a lot of it comes from Ferguson's portrayal of Faust. This is one actress to watch. She and her character really made this film for me. It's nice to have a new strong character as we've gotten used to the others. And to be honest when I see Cruise, Penn, Rhames, Renner and Baldwin I actually see them and not their characters as throughout the years they've become partially stereotyped. Which is a shame as it's this that lets the film down slightly. At least in MI III, the writers tried to give Ethan Hunt a deeper character, one with issues and problems - shame they didn't progress down that line. I would happily recommend this to all lovers of Mission Impossible and action films alike. There's not much you have to do as a viewer except sit back and enjoy... hopefully you'll make it to the edge of your seat a couple of times.Laughable and unapologetic Was this film laughable? Oh, yes. But while every recent comic book and spy movie desperately wants to be dark/serious (Hi, DC comics!) or meta (Hello, Deadpool!), the MI movies are a rare franchise: they are unapologetic. They are silly and ridiculous and excessive. No apologies. While Bond gets gritty, MI gets - well - fun. And suddenly we all remember that predictably comic thrill rides are worth the price of admission. Eventually, the Tom Cruise run will become the Jeremy Renner run. But the franchise will live. It just needs to remember that masks and twists are not a bad formula.Has Now Surpassed Bond In Terms Of Rollicking Action Fun I'm not usually the type that gets all too excited about action/adventure romp, but for the past, oh, 20 years of my life I've always been excited for the next James Bond movie to come out. My one indulgence in the genre. In recent years, however, that franchise has gone a bit stale, allowing the Mission Impossible franchise, including this "Rogue Nation" installment, to take the crown of best action movie. For a basic plot summary, "Rogue Nation" sees the IMF being shut down by the CIA Director (Alec Baldwin) right as they are on the verge of taking down the shadowy Syndicate, a network of crime baddies run by the mysterious Lane (Sean Harris). Now more off the books than ever before, the IMF team of Hunt (Tom Cruise), Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Luther (Ving Rhames) must track down Lane before they are out of time and resources. Lending a helping hand (or is it?) is British double-agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who seems to be playing all sides at once. Obviously, any "Mission Impossible" movie (especially those still under the helm of JJ Abrams' Bad Robot productions) is going to be judged on how riveting and pulse-pounding the action scenes are. "Rogue Nation" doesn't fail in that category one bit! From the opening scene of the film, which sees Tom Cruise perform one of the craziest stunts I've ever seen in a movie, the action scenes will blow you to the back of your chair. They are slick, have a great backing soundtrack, but also don't go on forever and ever. It never feels like the film is just a few extended action scenes cobbled together. Each action montage has a purpose. Along those lines, "Rogue Nation" manages to good from "okay action romp" to "really entertaining flick" due to the fact that it's able to weave an actual story into the proceedings. Not only that, but it's a story that will legitimately have you intrigued and guessing as to how everything will turn out. This is where the franchise really separates itself from the recent Bond efforts. Those films haven't had a great story since "Casino Royale", and before that it was "Goldeneye". That's two in about 20 years. Every since Bad Robot took the helm of the MI series, the three films have gotten progressively better. One final quick note about the MI/Bond comparison: These movies are far better at using female protagonists as well. Whereas the concept of "Bond Girls" is now at odds with the culture at large (unlike the franchise's heyday in the 60s and 70s), the MI films are able to utilize a sexy female lead who, at the same time, isn't just eye candy waiting to be bedded by the hero. So, despite the fact that Bond movies might still have more name recognition and gravitas behind them, the MI flicks have slowly crept up and taken their place as kind of the action/adventure romp. "Rogue Nation" is slick, smart, funny, a spectacle to watch, and even has a story that will keep you engaged. Hey, isn't that what the Bond franchise used to be able to do?An Excellent Addition To The Mission: Impossible franchise Tom Cruise returns to the role of IMF agent Ethan Hunt in this exciting, wonderful new installment. There are plenty of intense set pieces, including the opening plane scene and the wonderfully choreographed opera scene. The characters in this movie are okay, and Rebecca Ferguson delivers plenty of excitement and anticipation as Ilsa Faust, the mysterious new femme fatale whose motivations are never clear to the audience. The movie's main antagonist, however, is horrible and underdeveloped, and his motivations are never exactly clear. Why does he want to destroy the IMF? Is it because of the money? However, don't let this bloke spoil your enjoyment of the movie. My personal favourite set piece is the opera scene, which is ruined considerably by a twist at the end of the same scene. Nevertheless, this film is a wonderful addition to an already wonderful franchise.Must watch :) OK, guys, something's wrong with me. I am amazed by MI movie. Me who hates action movies and Tom Cruise... I could watch it again straight away. Cruise is bit older and much less irritating than usual, the rest of the crew is awesome, action scenes are adrenaline feast but the movie itself is not action movie any more. It's more of a spy thriller, and good one too. Movie starts fast and rushes faster and faster till the perfect ending. I could not find any weak spots in this sequel and it definitely is the best one so far. I gave it 9/10 only because 10/10 is reserved for the best movies of all times, classics of cinematography that will never grow old, and I could not go that far to put MI in same box with them. Although, if they continue to make every new MI better than previous I am afraid it might reach perfect 10 soon enough.  9/10Twists &amp; turns galore The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is that the overall emotional concept is a bit scattered. It's such a big team that the central character's personal stakes are not all that riveting. It's sort of a romantic tease for things to possibly come for Ethan though, so the fun factor overrides any lack of emotional angst. The theme is very interesting &amp; very clear, though words are seldom used to convey it: loyalty can be fickle. Such a theme lends to great twists &amp; turns. EVERY single character (except one minor bad guy) flipflops at least once in their loyalties (or seems to). It's a very complex roller-coaster that provides a really fun, knucklebiting ride as betrayals are followed by victories which are then undone by more betrayals, etc.  After several viewing it never gets boring. This is how an action film should be. Well done. Definitely my favorite in an ever improving series, which is rare. The biggest dud in the series is the first film, which in its time was a wonderful breakthrough &amp; still very watchable despite a very slower pacing. The trademark alternative realities given in flashforwards &amp; flashbacks continue to stand out as a fun element that keeps the mind engaged. Not sure how they'll top this one without getting formulaic.Its about time actions went back to being action films I could write a ten page report on this movie so keeping under a 1,000 words is super difficult for me. Thank you for getting back to what action movies are suppose to be. Car chase, fine women, violence, guns, and moves that make you go "wow that was original". This film set its own expectations for fight scenes. And it took Tom Cruise to do it. This man has been acting for well over 30 years. And still brings it in films. As I've said in other movie reviews I updated my blu ray collection and picked the 5 set of movies in a box set. I had to watch this one first. I've seen all the other ones except mission impossible one. And I was a huge fan of mission impossible two. I know some people might view this never have seen any mission impossibles wondering if this good. Don't ask your friends, just watch the movie. You also have to like action movies. If you like what everybody else likes and non original ideas based around comics you already have heard about or simply cartoons that you knew were coming out, this movie is not for you. If you are thinking you are going to see top gun or risky business (which by the way are my favorite, i own both on blu ray as well) then this isn't for you. Tom Cruise is a great actor and his sarcasm is easily a throw back to the james bond days. All characters in this movie were great actors. What more can I say about alec bladwin. Hes authority character he has done is so underrated in the filming industry its really sad. He played an authority character in The Departed and that was a 5 star movie. He just has a knack for drama and acting. Which he was the only person who added drama to this movie. And it was needed for making the plot come together. You can't really teach that. That was all alec baldwin.  As original as some things were, they were not original on the idea. Seriously this is your typical spy movie, james bond and jason bourne have made a killing on that. Have a target you are looking for, bring back all the people who help the spy out as the same characters you know and love, throw in a woman you can't tell at first if she is working with the enemy but turns out to double cross the bad guy. And yes I have seen the whole working for the other good guys think plenty of times too. Its nothing new. The car scenes as well were nothing new. You can tell BMW was part of this film, every car made you wish you had it. And yes some of the engine sounds were made up by a voice over of some kind. But if you have the 5.1 surround that comes with the disc you wont complain. And unlike those first bond movies, I can hear bullets whizzing by at 5.1 surround sound. I'm not expert of bullets whizzing around so Ill just except that as a good quality sound. And unlike other action movies. They lose you in the movie. Right to where you get to climax you just fall off. Like a date that just isn't going well anymore. You just want to get dropped off and go home or drop the person off and go home.  To many of these female characters don't play the part. I don't know if its the director telling them stick to their script or what. But they sound so stiff and simply predictable. This woman did not. She sounds sexy, gorgeous and she knows how to handle herself. Exactly how I expect a female agent to act. I think katie holmes was in the 3rd one. I almost passed out from boredom of her character.  I was going to list everything I liked about this movie in this review cause their were a lot but one of my favorite things was that it was set in a foreign place. Not sure how a lot of movies got away from that. It just has a certain feel to it. I enjoy the spy's who have a damn visa or create themselves one even if they are rogue. How the heck are you going to convince me you are trained killer or simply a covert specialist when you can't even get across your own border? And the end of the day this was a great movie. There was some things to take away from the movie. The bad guy didn't bring the film down. But I could have put john travolta in their and got much better results with a lot better lines. The girl was was definitely great. The part where she is in her bikini bottom was wonderful. Reminded you of the old bond movies where you were waiting for that character to show up like that. Its a must watch movie and honestly probably the best action movie I've seen in a while.I really liked "Rogue Nation". Tom Cruise still knows how to get down like them youngsters! Welcome back to the wonderland where impossible things happen nine times out of ten, and human bodies don't break down as they use to in the real world, even if one happens to crash with a superbike! Yes, it's the fifth "Mission: Impossible", aiming for the same throne as "Fast and Furious" and 007 series, among many others.  This is the genre colloquially known as "competence p*rn", which means usually drama or action movies full of skillful and powerful people doing tricky stuff which you should not try at home. And watching them do their thang, all confident and sh*t, is a big part of the viewing pleasure. "M:I" is all about action and big setpieces, starting strong with the airplane-infiltration and never letting us down later either. Quality job all around. As usual, action relies heavily on orchestrated movement, so, don't expect much realism. I would say that "Rogue Nation" doesn't try to be as massive action movie as two of the previous ones, or most of the "Fast and Furious", or 007 with Daniel Craig. But the result works well, everything is in its right place and there's always enough entertainment. The plot and the characters are really thin, to make room for the big set-pieces. So there's not much to remember afterwards to call it a real classic. After all, there are so many epic action movies these days, even fairy-tales go this way now.  But I really liked "Rogue Nation". Tom Cruise still knows how to get down like them youngsters!This is where Cruise belongs Tom Cruise currently has two movie series of which he is the star. There's the 'Mission: Impossible' series and there's the 'Jack Reacher' series. In the 'Jack Reacher' series he's about the only thing holding the whole show back. He's completely unsuited to the role and has destroyed a terrific character created by Lee Child in the books. However, in 'Mission: Impossible' it's quite the opposite. He's perfect for the lead role of 'Ethan Hunt' and plays him excellently. The suave, cocky, arrogant and intelligent character he's perfect for. The tough, large, physical, blunt and hulking one, not so much. 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' is another fine addition to the series. Much like the 'James Bond' series, I find you have to keep your brain switched on the entire movie, otherwise you're likely to become completely lost to the plot and just what exactly they're trying to achieve in each scene. I did find this one was well explained throughout and therefore easier just to sit back and enjoy the action, which is a major plus. I liked the villain enough (nothing to stand-out, but he did the trick) and the support cast did their thing around Cruise adequately. Ultimately though, it was his show and did what he usually does in this series and carried things. There's still plenty of life left in this series I feel.I know I'm supposed to hate this kind of a movie ...and often, I do. But I have to say I've enjoyed the Mission: Impossible films - first, the music and whole setup of the secretary disavowing etc. brings me back to my days watching the series. Secondly, these films are nonstop action with no let up. Third, you can pack your troubles away and just be entertained. What I hate is the fact that this is all Hollywood can do now - these CGI blockbusters with explosions, car chases, bungee jumps and the like - while it's left to independent filmmakers to give us stories with real people, real relationships, and real drama. After a review of the IMF missions, the IMF is disbanded and absorbed into the CIA.  Ethan Hunt goes rogue to stop a shadow syndicate from its path of destruction, and gets help from his old team: Willam Brandt, Benji Dunn, and Luther Stickell (Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames). He has to second-guess everything his nemesis, Solomon Lane, (Sean Harris) will do, asking himself, did he mean me to find this, am I supposed to react this way...in order to beat Lane at his own game.  In the mix is a double agent (Rebecca Ferguson) who, while trying to help Hunt, is answering to the syndicate. This is a perfect type of film for Tom Cruise. I've never thought much of his acting and have always preferred him in an action setting or playing someone like a hit man that requires him to be cold and calculating.  The IMF team was great, with Simon Pegg in the showiest role, and Sean Harris as Lane was one of the most frightening characters with the deadest eyes I've ever seen. Best for me was seeing the Vienna Staatsoper again during a performance of "Turandot" - the scenes there were particularly exciting, the music was beautiful, and it was great to see the opera house again.  This film is very well made, suspenseful, and exciting. Highly recommended.Hopefully There Will Be More Missions To Come! One thing I can say about these "Mission: Impossible" films, there's never a bad one. One or two might not be as good as the others but there's never a bad one, but "Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation", I would say, is the better out of the bunch. As one IMDb user put it, "This is what an action film should be." The fight scenes were fantastic, the chase scenes were flawless, even the part with the cargo jet, if you would consider that a chase scene, and the story-line and plot were good too. I read one review that said, "Seen it all before", which that might be the case a little but it's a "Mission: Impossible" film. They're agents dealing with the bad guys who are trying to take them out. Still this "Mission Impossible" film, so far, is the best and I'm waiting for the next one to come out.Just another great impossible mission. Loved every moment of this movie! Best actors, best plot, and so glad to see Jeremy Renner, and Simon Pegg.. They kept all the great actors for this movie and I am more than happy about it. Pegg is just a great actor, and Renner is one of my favorites! Hope to see him in more movies, including more Mission Impossibles. Never, ever ever kill off Ving Rhames, Jeremy Renners, or Simon Pegg.. obviously don't kill off Tom Cruise!!  I own every Mission Impossible movie, and HOPE to keep buying more! THANK YOU for making yet another badass Mission Impossible... You rock! I rate 10/10 and cannot wait for yet another Imossible Mission!!!An incredibly exciting mission! Part five in the Mission Impossible trilogy is a fast-paced and incredibly exciting mission. Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt of the IMF (Impossible Mission Force), who join forces with hi-tech friend Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and British spy Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) to take down the Syndicate, an International rogue organization - all the while trying to elude the CIA, who wants the IMF disbanded. This is a no-nonsense action thriller from start to finish, providing you with edge-of-your-seat entertainment; Hunt trying to expose those behind the Syndicate while he himself tries to be one step ahead of the CIA is double the suspense!  The stunts were amazing, especially Hunt's impossible mission of switching the computer identity cards in the underwater sequence, and his high-speed motorcycle case. Top kudos on the special effects and stunt teams for their remarkable work on this movie, especially their complete non-reliance on CGI!  The acting was pretty good - Tom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson make a great crime-fighting duo and had great on-screen chemistry. Ving Rhames and Jeremy Renner were decent, and Simon Pegg's was OK. They did most of the humor in the film which, I thought, was a little forced in certain points of the movie. But overall, it's an exciting action thriller that is pure fun and enjoyment!  Grade A-franchise getting better than ever Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) retrieves stolen nerve weapons in a daring operation. CIA director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) gets the IMF disbanded. William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) is forced to work under him. Hunt is captured by Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) and the murky Syndicate organization. Mysterious Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) helps him escape but is also working for the Syndicate. With the help of Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Hunt works to take down Lane and the Syndicate. This is a franchise that is getting better and better. The story works well. It's pretty simple with prerequisite twists. This is basically the new Bond franchise. Everybody works great in this one. Cruise is terrific and Pegg is funny. Renner has settled into the second banana spot. Rhames could be given more to do. Baldwin is a good addition but the best is Rebecca Ferguson. She kicks and acts too. She plays a compelling character and has great chemistry with Cruise. One can't wait for the next one.Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation flawlessly combines action with story! The Mission Impossible franchise is distinct in the fact that it only seems to improve with time. Ghost Protocol was absolutely amazing, but Rogue Nation manages to out perform its predecessor in every way possible. Whether its the over-the-top stunts, perfectly shot action sequences, or intriguing story lines, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation delivers another amazing action movie for 2016 Major props go to director/screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. McQuarrie was able to compose an extremely compelling story, which isn't customary to the Mission Impossible franchise. Interesting characters coupled with a number of plot twists and some tense dialogue help keep the movie fresh from start to finish. If the amazing story wasn't enough to keep viewers attached, then some awesome action sequences should suffice. In what seems to be a trend in 2016, McQuarrie uses practical stunts that lead to some of the most visually-striking action sequences every constructed. Then of course there is Tom Cruise who once again shows us why his is the undisputed King Of Action. His dedication towards the character of Ethan Hunt, as well as his role as a producer and willingness to perform his own stunts are just the icing on the cake!The most satisfying movie I've seen in a long time I probably saw the first film of the franchise back in the day, but then I never paid attention to what came afterwards. Until a couple weeks ago when I watched Ghost Protocol (which was really great!), and just recently I got to see Rogue Nation. My God, it's even better than the previous one! It is a well directed, suspenseful, great looking, action-packed, exciting action movie. I honestly didn't think that big studios are still able to produce such awesomeness, but thank God I was wrong. I know these words might sound over the top, but I am genuinely enthusiastic about this film, because it was so much fun to watch, and I haven't had an experience like it for a long time! Tom Cruise is amazing, just like the rest of the cast. The plot is okay, there are some good twists, there's good humour and really- really good action sequences. It is not a perfect movie (for example, there's a pretty bad cgi car flip, and when I saw that I was like: I hope the rest of the film will not be like that; and thankfully it wasn't), it will not transform your world (at the end of the day it's an action movie), but it was exactly what you want to see when you sit down for a blockbuster action flick: pure excitement and fun!Mark Twain once said that, "A NIGHT AT THE OPERA . . . " " . . . is a good walk spoiled." In this loose remake of director Alfred Hitchcock's THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH II (1956), the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (episode 24 or so) people quadruple the number gun-wielding assassins Hitchcock had prowling around in an opera hall, and switch the program to Puccini's TURANDOT (which was just used for similar dramatic purposes by another action blockbuster a few months back, but I'm not any better than Twain in keeping my opera cameos straight). Tom Cruise also retraces Jimmy Stewart's footsteps to Morocco from TOO MUCH (though since kidnapped children would raise the suspense stakes far too high for today's squeamish movie audiences, only Cruise's comic relief sidekick gets snatched here). Anyone expecting a big musical hit to emerge from MISSION 24, such as Doris Day singing her young son to Freedom with "Que, Sera, Sera," will be sorely disappointed. So too will the folks dying to know what happens in TURANDOT. (SPOILER ALERT: Ping, Pong, and Pang cannot persuade the Mystery Prince to tell Turandot his name, but after Liu's tortured and kills herself, Turandot decides to live happily-ever-after with the Prince, anyway). But for fans of implausible chases, bad guys who cannot shoot the broad side of a palace, and imaginary Higher Tech, MISSION 24 won't disappoint.The quintessential action film Full disclosure: I have never seen any of the previous Mission Impossible films. Not sure how I have avoided it, but it's true. I do vaguely recall the original TV series. This is the quintessential action film. It has chases, explosions, danger, tension, extreme stunts, an evil conspiratorial cabal led by an implacable foe, everything. It is unsullied by much in the way of romance, no shoehorned-in sex scenes with the obligatory female character, which was excellently portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson, a Swedish actress with whom I was unfamiliar. Cruise was Cruise, a successful, if unlikely action hero. Good work by also by Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames. I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.The Mission Impossible Series:Part 5-Rogue Nation. Walking past a local DVD shop,I was shocked to find that they were selling the limited edition 2 disc Blu-Ray of the latest Mission Impossible title at a cheaper price than everyone else is selling the one disc edition for.Since having greatly enjoyed the 4th film in the series,I felt that it was the perfect time to accept the latest mission. The plot: Learning about an international criminal consortium called the Syndicate,IMF agent Ethan Hunt goes to stop the group from selling nerve gas to terrorists.Destroying the nerve gas,Hunt gets caught by surprise,and knocked out.Waking up,Hunt finds himself being tortured by members of the Syndicate,which includes a rogue British agent called Ilsa Faust.Working undercover,Faust knocks out her fellow gang members and helps Hunt to escape. 6 Months later:  With there being no sign of Hunt for months,CIA head Alan Hunley gets the IMF shut down over the "destructive" methods which it has solved cases with.Remaining undercover,Hunt gets fellow (former) agent Benjamín "Benji" Dunn to attend an opera which the Austrian Chancellor. Arriving at the opera,Hunt and Dunn begin to fear that they are about to see a symphony composed by the Syndicate. View on the film: Reuniting with Cruise after Jack Reacher,co-writer/(along with Drew Pearce) director Christopher McQuarrie &amp; cinematographer Robert Elswit give the globe-trotting locations a stylish elegance,as an assassination attempt at an opera house is lit in icy blue,and a breakneck motorbike chase grinds dusty yellows into the screen.Keeping up with the gripping stunts being (largely) performed by the cast, McQuarrie releases crisp tracking shots,which along with giving the title an urgent atmosphere,also allows the viewer to clearly see every punch and dive delivered. Standing out from the other films in the series,the screenplay by McQuarrie &amp; Pearce make this the first Mission movie to have a strong connection to the previous films,with the writers transferring The Syndicate group from the TV series (where they were the main baddies) to the film universe.Whilst the action gets off to a flying start with a dazzling sequence filmed on the outside of a plane, (which was filmed in real time!)the writers keep the action entwined with the plot,with the Syndicate's activities pushing Hunt and his fellow spies to take drastic measures. Dipping into the espionage origins of Mission Impossible,the writers surprisingly allow the Syndicate to strike some heavy blows,as Hunt (played by a terrific Tom Cruise) meets his match in the icy,femme fatale Ilsa Faust, (played by the alluringly whip-smart Rebecca Ferguson) who gives Hunt his own mission impossible.Don't just leave a guy hanging'. Tom Cruise is back again for the fifth time as undercover agent Ethan Hunt of the Impossible Mission Force. Intense and full of action as Hunt pushes himself to his mental and physical capabilities. This, I think, is the best of the franchise. The CIA, led by an animate chief Hunley (Alec Baldwin), is wanting the IMF to be permanently shutdown. Ethan believes with all his worth that he can bring down the mysterious Syndicate raging to seize global control. Hunt will go rogue in his self-assigned ridiculously dangerous mission to prove the IMF is still needed. Hunt enlists teammates Benji(Simon Pegg), Luther (Ving Rhames) and special agent Brandt (Jeremy Renner) in a world-trotting undercover chore...that doesn't actually stays undercover. One of the best parts of the film is when Hunt gets the aid of a fetching British double-agent Ilsa Faust(Rebecca Ferguson). Rounding out the cast: Jens Hulten, Sean Harris, Simon McBurney and Tom Hollander.5th film. -Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation is a 2015 American action spy film co-written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. It is the fifth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. The film stars Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris, and Alec Baldwin with Cruise, Renner, Pegg, and Rhames reprising their roles from previous films. Rogue Nation is produced by Cruise, J. J. Abrams, and David Ellison of Skydance Productions. In the film, IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is on the run from the CIA, following the IMF's disbandment as he tries to prove the existence of the Syndicate, an international mysterious terrorist consortium. --Critical response: -On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation has a rating of 93% positive reviews, based on 261 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation continues the franchise's thrilling resurgence — and proves that Tom Cruise remains an action star without equal." Metacritic gives the film a rating of 75 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a grade of "A-" on an A+ to F scale. --Sequel: -By May 2015, Paramount was developing a sixth Mission: Impossible film, with Cruise, Abrams, Ellison, and Goldberg returning to produce, along with Don Granger and Matt Grimm executive producing, and Elizabeth Raposo overseeing development. Shortly before the release of Rogue Nation, Cruise announced he would return for a sixth film, asserting that it could begin production in 2016. Following Cruise's statement, Paramount also confirmed that a sixth film was in development. By December 2015, McQuarrie announced that he will be returning to direct the sixth film and Ferguson will be reprising her role as Ilsa Faust as well.The 'Mission: Impossible' franchise is aging like wine Maybe it wasn't impossible, but in 2011 it seemed highly likely that the aging Tom Cruise and the "Mission: Impossible" series could keep going after three films spanning 10 years (and all earning merely "decent" marks). Then "Ghost Protocol" hit theaters and made doubters bite their tongues. That being the case, "Rogue Nation" keeps those teeth firmly clamped down. Despite losing the "Ghost Protocol" screenwriters as well as director Brad Bird, "Rogue Nation" doesn't slip under the watch of Oscar winner Christopher McQuarrie ("The Usual Suspects") who directed Cruise in 2012's franchise-starting action thriller "Jack Reacher" and wrote his 2014 star vehicle "Edge of Tomorrow." Needless to say, their marriage is working. McQuarrie's screenplay elevates the thriller and espionage elements of the franchise. The weakest aspect of "Ghost Protocol" was its plot, but "Rogue Nation" keeps the mystery tight and its terrorism-focused conflict is less outrageous than some past "M:I" evil schemes.  In the fifth installment, the IMF finds itself disbanded by an angry CIA honcho (Alec Baldwin) just as Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has uncovered the existence of the Syndicate, a global network of disavowed, missing and presumed dead secret service agents conducting widespread terrorism. Resourceless and with the CIA breathing down their necks, Hunt must secretly coordinate with Benji (Simon Pegg), Luther (Ving Rhames) and Brandt (Jeremy Renner) to find the man behind the Syndicate and stop them. Along the way, Hunt comes across a former British Intelligence agent in deep cover with the Syndicate named Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who is in every way his equal yet whose allegiances make their relationship complicated. Ferguson explodes into Hollywood in this role as a young but mature-looking field agent with acrobatic takedown moves like Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow from the Marvel film universe. Ferguson really shares the spotlight with Cruise instead of playing his arm candy. Whereas "Ghost Protocol" was more about suspense and innovative action (the Burj Khalifa sequence is still among the best of the decade), but "Rogue Nation" takes a more visceral approach. Aside from the "James Bond"-like opening sequence that sees Cruise holding on to an airplane door as it takes off, the stunt work isn't larger- than-life so much as tight, gritty and explosive. Actually, "Rogue Nation" shares a lot of DNA with the modern "Bond" films in terms of action and globe-trotting. Robert Elswit's cinematography in this film and "Ghost Protocol" have really helped the franchise up the visual ante in a way that has dramatically increased its esteem. There are still lots of formulaic tendencies and things that keep the franchise light, but it's more fun than it's ever been. So after 10 years of languishing, the "Mission: Impossible" franchise has earned its way into the echelon of the best active action film franchises, and it better hurry before its 53-year-old action star decides to "take it easy for awhile." ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for moreAnother Mission Accomplished - Rogue Nation Rules I loved MI Rogue Nation. This franchise keeps delivering what the audience wants - Tom Cruise, an unbeatable bad guy, beautiful smart tough women, controversy, car/plane/bike chases, and an impossible mission.  The usual cast of supporting characters are back to support Ethan Hunt who is somewhere in the world doing something to save us. The plane chase scene at the start is like the fuse lit at the beginning of all MI movies. You know then that you are in for action.  The bad guy is this mysterious Syndicate leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). He is the cool bad guy who never seems to get riled, is always one step or more ahead, and has every detail planned with vicious cold- heartedness - the picture of the modern day terrorist. The beautiful spy is Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). She was pretty good, making you wonder throughout which side she really belongs to. Then there is the intrigue about the whole Syndicate - who is the leader? why are they doing these things? The story works really well I think. Can the MI team come back even though they are now (again?) unsanctioned? How can they stop a gang of ex-agents, bad guys, and all around terrible folks? How can they catch up to a guy who is always one step ahead? It's an impossible mission. Tom Cruise delivers another great performance, but you can only wonder how many more of these he has in him - at 53, he's getting a bit old for the physicality these roles require. But hey, what with the Expendables, and the Taken series, and Kevin Costner rejuvenating himself as a spy, you never know.  If you like action movies, go see MI-Rogue Nation. Enjoy.Now that's a movie! I for one am a fan of MI movies so I may be biased. But this was a non stop action thrill ride, filled with great action sequences, plausible story lines and comedy to boot! This movie gets right to it the first scene we are right in the action. What I love about this movie is that, even though it's complicated, it makes sense. The way it unfolds is excellent, and you can follow it. This action movie does not make the mistakes of others. It has no pointless scenes, it does not have impossible tech, does not take itself too seriously and is not sexist as fu(&amp;. I really really really enjoyed that the woman who helped Ethan out was not treated like a physical object and simply 'the love interest'. You know simply a toy for our hero to play with....no. She was an actual human being! Amazing! Sure she is attractive but so is the rest of the cast. I really liked how she was treated equally, very refreshing considering how sexist most movies tend to be. The movie keeps you guessing, NOT confused. There is a BIG difference there. So if you wanna see top of the line special effects and have a whole lot of fun this is the film for you! I highly recommend it! They keep the film current with some nods to the past films. It's just perfect. I like how the movie does not lose itself in the bs trends most movies do. This one will be a classic that you could enjoy for many years to come.I thoroughly enjoyed this epic action movie! 8/10 Review: I really enjoyed this movie! It's full of drama right from the get go and the action scenes are really impressive. I also liked the fact that they all pulled together for this mission and that it wasn't just Tom Cruise being a one man army. Anyway, after there many successful missions, which saved many life's, the IMF are under investigation because of there underarm tactics and the money that they have cost the US government, so Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) shuts down the elite squad which means that they have to tackle crime without there backing. When the IMF come under attack by the syndicate, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) gathers his team to take down the ruthless Lane (Sean Harris) who has killed many innocent people, without remorse. After being saved by IIsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who is working for Lane, he digs into her past, only to find out that she is also an agent, working undercover and they soon join forces to stop Lane from getting an priceless disk which contains information about the syndicate. Whilst battling against Lane's henchmen, Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), help Ethan to protect the disk and to stop Lane from killing more innocent people, while William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) tackles the political side of there operation. After saving many life's and finally taking down Lane and the syndicate, the US government decide to carry on backing the IMF, now that Alan Hunley has seen, first hand, what they are capable of. This fast paced movie has a very detailed storyline with some amazing stunts, especially the outrageous stunt on the plane at the beginning and it was good to see everyone finally pull there weight in the organisation. Alec Baldwin will definitely make a great addition to the team, which means that we might actually see more of Jeremy Renner in the field alongside Tom Cruise. Anyway, like many of the other Mission Impossible movies, Cruise really does give this movie his all and the many twists in the storyline made this a joy to watch. All of the different members of the IMF, bring something unique to the team and the chemistry between each member is felt on screen, especially between Pegg &amp; Cruise. Basically, I really enjoyed it and I can't wait to see another movie from this franchise. Great Watch! Round-Up: Tom Cruise is still doing these death defying stunts at 53 years old and with Top Gun 2 in development alongside Jack Reacher 2 and Mission Impossible 6, he really isn't showing any signs of slowing down. As he produced Rogue Nation, alongside J.J. Abrams, he had a lot of input when it came to the action scenes and the storyline, so he really did put a lot of effort into bringing something original to audiences. I wasn't a big fan of Jack Reacher, Oblivion, Knight &amp; Day and Rock of Ages but I did enjoy Edge Of Tomorrow and the funny Tropic Thunder, were he played a role which is completely out of his comfort zone but it earned him an Golden Globe nomination. For 2015, Rogue Nation came in 11th place in box office earning, which isn't bad because a lot of big movies came out this year. It really is what it says on the tin so if your into your action films with a "goodie vs. baddie" concept, then you will definitely enjoy this movie. Budget: $150million Worldwide Gross: $682.3million I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/thrillers starring Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin, Sean Harris and Simon McBurney. 8/10Of Thinly Disguised Identities. These fracnhises have replaced the weejkkly adventure series on televvision. It doesn't matter who the stars are or what the plot is. Everything and everyone are replaceable. Okay, Connery and Stallone are out, but Damon and Cruise are now in. No more SMERSH but then we have "The Syndicate." If there are any consistent themes, they are advanced technology and the superior combat skills of the protagonist.  Well, I suppose there are other iterated shots at a more molecular level -- an armed man is fighting an unarmed man and there is a shot of the weapon skidding across the floor; one combatant slams his forehead against that of the other and disables him, and to hell with Newton; a shoe stomps on the accelerator cut to a tire burning rubber and raising a cloud of dust. This film as at least one example of each cliché. It's just added evidence that the fall of civilization is at hand. Here's another I'll throw in for the cognocenti among us. An assassination attempt -- mostly out of Hitchcock's "The Man Who Knew Too Much" -- takes place during an opera. It's "Madam Butterfly." Now guess which aria you're going to hear. At least no one will sleep during the bullets and acrobatics.  The villainous organization here has no particular plan in mind. It's not an underground nest of rich Nazis or rabid drug dealers. It's only purpose, we're told, is to "destroy the system that created it." Right.  You can watch it if you like. Personally, these sequels drain me of energy in the way that Hollywood has been drained of imagination.Another fun M:I movie I'm really glad the franchise is still going. This was yet another action-packed movie from the series. There are some fantastic, creative scenes shot inside the Vienna Opera House, and an awesome underwater scene later on in the movie. Great to see some returning cast members as well.THANKS TOM! This is one of the best 'thrillers' of all time in the true sense of the word, and the best written story in the series. Thanks Tom and company for showing that teamwork can work wonders!The 5th Installment in the Series is a Must See!!! Ethan and team take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF. With the beautiful addition of the talented Mrs. Rebecca Ferguson and the menacing Mr. Sean Harris Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is a thrilling, fast paced and incredible New Installment in the MI Series and one that needs to be seen. Plus that Opening Airplane Scene is Freaking Incredible!!!! (A+)Time for a Rethnk? "Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation" is the fifth instalment in the long-running "Mission: Impossible" series. It shows the obvious influence of the even-longer-running Bond series. All the films in these two franchises involve Our Hero, named either James Bond or Ethan Hunt, travelling around the world with a glamorous female sidekick to various exotic foreign locations, performing various feats of improbable (not to say impossible) derring-do in an attempt to thwart the evil schemes of some dastardly individual or organisation.  "Rogue Nation" fits this template more or less exactly. Hunt, accompanied by his glamorous female sidekick Ilsa Faust, travels to Minsk, Vienna, Havana, Morocco and London, performing various feats of derring-do along the way, in an attempt to thwart the evil schemes of the Syndicate, a mysterious terrorist group. Those schemes include the assassination of various world leaders, including the Austrian Chancellor and the British Prime Minister. As the "Mission Impossible" franchise is an American one, London counts as an exotic foreign location in a way in which it does not in the Bond series.  In some respects "Rogue Nation" parallels recent developments in the Bond cycle. In early Bonds it was generally easy to tell who was on what side- Bond, his MI6 colleagues and the lovely Bond Girl were all on the side of right and justice whereas the villains (Dr No, Blofeld, Goldfinger, etc.) and their henchmen were first into bat for Satan's kingdom. Occasionally, as with Pussy Galore in "Goldfinger", the Bond Girl started off working for the baddies, but inevitably changed sides (aided by Bond's powers of seduction) when she realised just what a bastard her employer really was.  In more recent episodes, however, Bond has had to cope with inter-service rivalry between MI5 and MI6, former British agents going over to the dark side and colleagues who prove untrustworthy. So it proves in "Rogue Nation". Hunt has to do battle not only against the Syndicate but also against the CIA, who want to shut down the IMF whose agents are regarded as unreliable. (In this context "IMF" stands not for "International Monetary Fund" but "Impossible Mission Force"). The head of the Syndicate, Solomon Lane, turns out to be a rogue British agent (just like the characters played by Sean Bean in "Goldeneye" and Javier Bardem in "Skyfall"). And Hunt never knows whom he can trust- not even the lovely Ilsa and his friend colleague Benji Dunn. (Ilsa, despite her German-sounding name, is also an MI6 agent).  One difference between the "Mission: Impossible" series and the Bonds is that, although the series has been going for over twenty years, the main character has been played by the same actor throughout. Tom Cruise was 53 when "Rogue Nation" was made and I understand that he will return in a sixth instalment later this year, making him, at 56, older than either Sean Connery or Roger Moore when they made their final Bonds. In 2015, however, Cruise still looked youthful enough to be plausible as the hero of an action thriller, and I doubt if the intervening three years will have made much difference in this respect when "Mission: Impossible" emerges. Rebecca Ferguson makes a lovely heroine and there is a good cameo from Alec Baldwin as the CIA boss, although Sean Harris as Lane never seems very threatening, more like a provincial bank manager than a rogue spy or international terrorist. As a thriller, in fact, "Rogue Nation" is quite a decent one with some good special effects and well-handled action scenes. It does, however, have two problems, which it shares with a number of recent spy films involving betrayal or double-dealing. The first is that the plot at times becomes so complex it can be difficult to understand. The second is that plots of this nature are starting to become over-familiar; increasing complexity seems to increase, rather than decrease, the feeling of "seen-it-all=before". Perhaps it is time for a rethink of the modern spy genre. 6/10 A goof. The Austrian Chancellor is referred to as a "European head of state". In fact, the Austrian Chancellor, like the British Prime Minister, is Head of Government but not Head of State. The Head of Sate of Austria is the President.Cruise and McQuarrie make a good team. *no spoilers* Let me start with Jack Reacher, that film was good but didn't live up to the book. However McQuarrie made Cruise work in the role by adding a new flavour to his own kinda take on the 'Reacher' books, this is what he has done again with this film. He made this Mission Impossible feel different. It was not only a new kind of take on the previous films, it also felt just as isolated as Ghost Protocol, which in my opinion is a smart move with these films - much like what the Bond films do. It returns to the original things you loved about the original films, but extracts all the cheesy campy 'Cruise-liners' and actually gives the character more of Ethan Hunt an emotional state with more realistic intentions and motives. Almost like someone you can relate to, or wish to be. Cruise once again plays the character more extremely and heightens his predeceasing film by far. This film drags at times within story wise, but the expert on screen chemistry between Pegg and Cruise keeps you distracted, as well as the amazing action and car chase scenes. Overall I would go watch this in cinema to experience the full scale of how big and noisy the action is, and it would be worth pre-ordering on Blu-Ray DVD too.An Absolute Blast! Mind Blowing Stunts and Gadgets! A roller coaster of non-stop excitement! Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) faces a new threat called the Syndicate, a network dedicated to establish a new world order via terrorist attacks. Ethan has another problem - his agency, IMF, is shut down. Now, his team consists of rogue agents with the most impossible mission yet. I'm just going to be frank, this is my first Mission Impossible film and Rogue Nation makes me want to see more. As a movie lover, I get excited when I'm introduced to new film franchises and boy was this an introduction. Having no history with the franchise, it did not damage my extreme enjoyment.  The film itself is an absolute blast. When the credits rolled, I felt as if I'd just come off an amusement park ride. This film has incredible car chases, mind blowing stunts and gadgets that even James Bond would beg for. Every scene is better than the last. Action is not the only thing that fuels this movie. It also has tremendous actors. Some of the feats pulled in this film are absurd and stretch your belief system. Performers like Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg successfully help you buy into these impossible situations. Even the characters they play are aware of the insanity but they treat it like an everyday occurrence because it's their job. Like magicians, there is a charm and elegance from the performer, so you don't catch the strings and mirrors.  Even if you haven't seen other Mission Impossible films, I bet you recognize the iconic music. Many films and TV Shows have satirized it and who can blame them? The theme is grand! Many composers have added their own touch to it like Danny Elfman and even Hans Zimmer. This film's track is composed by Joe Kraemer and is one of the best versions, if not the best. The music starts out with two notes and then grows. As the music got louder, my pulse rose until the title came up and the Mission Impossible theme burst through the speakers. The music really gets you into the mood.  My favorite character is Benji (Simon Pegg). I love the characters that have the gadgets and technology to help our hero. Benji is not only a loyal friend to Ethan, but their history makes the interactions between them funnier and sincere.  My favorite scene is when Cruise is under water switching the security codes. When you hear about actors doing their own stunts, one man comes to mind - Tom Cruise. Cruise is known for his authenticity with stunts. (That's really him hanging on to the outside of the plane - with safety precautions of course) You'd think he's at his limit. Well, according to the director (Christopher McQuarrie), in this scene Cruise held his breath for six minutes. I looked it up! Even McQuarrie thought it was, "too real." While you're watching the scene, you're holding your breath as well.  The moral of the story is, "Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer." Ethan has teamed up with Lisa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), an agent who may or may not be part of the Syndicate. Ethan is unsure if he can trust her, but he knows if he stays with her, the closer he is to stopping the Syndicate. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to ages 10 through 18. There is, of course, violence and language but nothing you wouldn't expect in a PG-13 film. Your mission is to see Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. It is in theaters July 31. Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst dot org.Good Movie! Ethan Hunt did it again! Overall it's a good movie, full with a twisted plot as well as the action that Tom's tradition to do the real stunt by himself. This time is quite insane as he hanging outside a flying airplane! However, I have several "complaints" such as Ethan could use carbon fiber diving equipment to make the job easier hehehe :P And one more "complaint" that I have: Alibaba Picture has invested to this movie, but why not involved Jack Ma to be the villain?! I am sure it would be more interesting isn't it? XD In summary it is worth to watch! :)No Signs That the Series is Slowing Down Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015)  *** 1/2 (out of 4)  Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his group must try and locate the Syndacate and prove that they are real as well as stop their latest mission. I'm not going to spoil too much of the plot to MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION because it's really best that you go into the film with as little knowledge of the plot as possible. Yes, you heard me correct. Even though this is a summer action movie full of spectacular stunts, it also features a plot and a very good one at that. The film starts off with a terrific stunt with Cruise hanging from an airplane and after seeing this you can't help but wonder how the rest of the film is going to top it. It starts off a bit slow after this as we get a subplot dealing with the CIA but the final hour of this movie is one terrific experience after another. There are several reasons this film works so well but we can start off with the obvious, which are the terrific stunts. Most people have seen portions of the airplane during the television spots and the trailers and this here is certainly eye-opening but there's so much terrific stuff that follows. There's a breath-taking sequence that takes place in the water that will have you holding your breathe. There's a terrific bait-and-switch inside a political powerhouse. There's the fantastic chase on motorcycles through winding streets. There's also a beautifully orchestrated sequence inside an opera house, which certainly seems like a wink to Hitchcock and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. Another thing that makes this series stand apart from so many others is the fact that we do get actual stories. Again, I'm not going to ruin all the twists and turns here but you're constantly caught up in it and wondering where the next mystery is going to come from. Then there are the performances with Cruise once again shining in the title role. I still remember watching the first film in the theater and it's hard to believe that all these years later Cruise is still going strong. Jeremy Renner, Alec Baldwin, Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg are all in fine form and Rebecca Ferguson is terrific in her part. MISSION: IMPOSSIBE - ROGUE NATION pretty much packs everything into one film and in the end it's certainly one of the best of the summer and proves that the series shows no signs of slowing down.One must see mission Found the first three films ones that had a lot to like (namely the action, the visuals, good casting on the whole and Philip Seymour Hoffmann's superb villain in the third) but also their faults (plot convolution in the first and third and the characters could have been written better in the second and third). 'Ghost Protocool' to me was a great film and the best of the series since the original, and actually better than it, mainly because the story even though somewhat familiar seemed more focused and far less convoluted. The latest instalment 'Rogue Nation' is on 'Ghost Protocool's' very high level. Sure, there is a little bit of familiarity and the basic structure is somewhat formulaic, but 'Rogue Nation' has enough freshness and so much fast and furious excitement and thrills it doesn't feel like an issue. Visually, 'Rogue Nation' is even slicker and even more stylish than 'Ghost Protocool', perhaps the most audacious of all five films put together. The locations, from sinister drabness to stunningly colourful, are a feast for the eye and the effect dazzle. The music doesn't overbear the action and such at all while making a pulsating impact thanks to the thrillingly authentic sound. With the exception of a few choppy combat scenes, big emphasis on the few, the action is bigger, bolder and more dynamic than any other action scenes seen before in the previous four instalments. Many are breath-taking in their excitement and also nuances. Christopher McQuarrie's directing is some of the best he's ever done, with a great sense of visual style and a real grasp of the storytelling. 'Rogue Nation's' script is sharp, knowingly sophisticated with the humour (not cheesy or out of place) and intrigue superbly balanced. The story is told at a breakneck pace without being rushed and grips one right in and never lets go. There is an appealing light-heartedness, tongue-in-cheek and suspense of superior tension and elegance (as far as the 'Mission Impossible' films go) worthy of Alfred Hitchcock, a big claim and to some hyperbolic but it felt that way to me and it is grand praise indeed. Tom Cruise is very impressive, handling the stunts with effortless and enviable ease and acting with steely charisma. Rebecca Ferguson shows a knack for scene-stealing, with her in ersatz breath-of-fresh-air form. Sean Harris is an intimidatingly menacing villain, one of the best written villains of the series, while Simon Pegg's comic relief in no way jars and is actually very funny and Jeremy Renner's presence is more than welcome. It is a shame however that Ving Rhames, though charismatic, is underused. Overall, a sheer delight and one mission that is a must see. 9/10 Bethany CoxNot bad, but a big step down in quality from the last two ROGUE NATION is the latest MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE and by my count the fifth in the series. Sadly I was hoping it would be as good as the previous instalment in the franchise, GHOST PROTOCOL, and it doesn't come anywhere close to that film's quality; too much of it is filled with unrealistic scenes and humour which really starts to grate after a while. The film has much in common with SPECTRE in that it sees Tom Cruise and his team going after a mysterious organisation set on controlling the world, although the organisation here seems to consist of one guy, master villain Sean Harris, who is incidentally on autopilot throughout. We get the usual template film, featuring massive action chase spectacle sequences, a heist or two, plot twists and betrayals, and lots of sparky dialogue between the lead characters. Superficially the film is entertaining; a movie with tons of action like this would be hard pressed not to entertain. The motorbike chase in Morocco is a highlight, and the early plane stunt is great fun, especially as it was filmed close to home. But the script is below par and makes odd choices, like making Simon Pegg a secondary lead when he's not been around much previously other than playing the token geek. Cruise goes through the motions with aplomb, but Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames have so little to do that you wonder why they bothered showing up. Worst of all is Rebecca Ferguson as one of those irritatingly perfect action women who comes out on top time and time again; she has one stock expression on her face from beginning to end and really got up my nose. ROGUE NATION comes third in my list of favourite MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE films, better than the first two but behind the fourth and third ones.Good flick but disbelief creeps in with the motorcycle chase I've written and sold screenplays, love movies and am very easy to please. I quite enjoyed the new MI film. I can also suspend my disbelief with the best of them. But please  I love a good chase scene but they are just too unrealistic. I have owned two of the BMW S1000RR motorcycles featured in the film and there is no way any car is going to keep up with a modern sport bike for even a moment. Come on screenwriters, come up with something new. Make me and Steve McQueen believers again. The film worked well, was well paced and Elsa stole the show. Last quip, at the end, they need our hero alive, and then start shooting at him? Another instance where the writers just ante up a clichéd shoot-out chase that gets a bit boring if it doesn't support the story.This Was So Much FUN! Well played Alec Baldwin! I had no idea what your mission impossible was until the middle of the movie *LOL*  I haven't had this much fun in 2 hours, in such a LONG time. No matter how predictable the ending - Tom Cruise is always such a delight to watch - what an exhilarating ride. As always it would not be Mission Impossible without the legendary Mission Impossible musical score and now 3-D printed masks. They even threw in a few extra heart-stopping, pulse racing stunt action. The motorcycle chase was even better than the Mini Cooper thrill ride of The Italian Job.  Simon Pegg &amp; Ving Rhames are truly Cruise's Yin n Yang.

OK, so I loved mission impossible: ghost protocol, I told myself they cannot do better than that, that's just the best it gets, it's impossible to do any better! Well, something you learn from these movies is NOTHING is impossible! Oh my goodness this film was incredible! Great action sequences! Impeccable performances by every single actor, including the newbie Alec Baldwin! The plot was so well put together, along with the script and dialogue between characters. The camera shots and even the scenery was well done also. The mission impossible movies just get it right! I don't know what it is, they just do!! Of course Tom Cruise was just amazing as Tom always is in every movie! My expectations were SURPASSED here, the best MI movie ever!! I also especially enjoyed the main actresses role and performance in the film. 10/10.Worst in the franchise Baffled by all the positive reviews, as this is dull as ditch water.  The series peaked with Brad Bird's wonderful 'Ghost Protocol', and this latest one is just a rehash of every previous film. You can make a check- list of what to expect and tick them off one by one: Good guy turns out to be bad guy, the IMF have to operate outside the law, they have to wear masks, etc, etc, except done without any of the flair of previous entries and with a rubbish villain. The only saving grace is Rebecca Ferguson, as she offers a breath of fresh air to the stale atmosphere.Apart from her, there's nothing else to recommend it. It's definitely time that Tom Cruise laid this to rest, but since it's his only consistent cash-cow, I doubt that will happen any time soon.It's flashy and slick, but boring and soulless.For The Love of God Literally the worst movie i have ever seen. I could not bare to watch one more moment of this film. The dialogue was terrible, the acting was terrible, pretty much everything was terrible except for the hot chick in it. I would not advise anyone to see such a movie. Please save your money and buy some food or some crap. That would be way more enjoyable. I have never left a review for a movie before this but this one deserved my opinion. I literally had to walk out of the theater because I couldn't take it anymore.  Not only did the movie contain the most obvious and constantly overused movie tropes, but it assumes it's audience is literally brain-dead. Furthermore, the CGI actions scenes were worse than the quality seen in Jurassic World, except the CGI in the original Jurassic Park was somehow better than the two combined. 75% of the 150 Million dollar budget was probably used to coax Simon Pegg and Alec Baldwin to star in such a train-wreck, I mean seriously, Pegg was in Hot-fuzz and Shaun of The Dead. SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Simon Peggs career is just as over as Alec Baldwins, matter of fact, the next thing you're probably going to see Simon Pegg in is a Travelocity commercial. Also, I want to discuss Tom Cruise. Scientology probably had a hand in this piece of garbage, there's no way they didn't. They must be all up in Hollywood pulling strings because otherwise this piece of filth would never have made it to theaters for people to be tortured by. Tom Cruise has never, in his entire career made a good film. Top Gun might be the only debatable film because of the Kenny Loggins song. Please, please, please, for the love of God, if you respect yourself or those that you love, DO NOT take them to this film. Tom is lucky the Geneva Conventions hasn't learned of this films existence otherwise he would be on trial for war crimes against the greater good. I put this film on the same level as, that feeling you get when you eat too much spicy Mexican food. You know you messed up really bad, and now you can do nothing but sit and cry about the terrible mistakes you have made and just pray for it to be over. I have never been much of a praying man, but at this point I would like to say one thing to whatever God may, or may not be up there: I don't ask you for much, but please for the love of Christ, make this movie go away, arguably before world hunger because it is truly that bad.
A movie that qualifies as strong meat a.k.a. be ready to digest a lot of reality and face the true face of a world unknown to people living in a happy bubble. This movie undid something inside of me. It's that part of you that holds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for humanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the catholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that. Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. "Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us." Indeed. When we witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it, that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, "You can join the millions talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the night." So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedication of the actors to their roles, to the script, the director and the cinematography. The score? Fantastic. Howard Shore did it again!It Could've Been You I've rated almost a hundred movies and I've only ever given out six 10s on this website. I don't rave about many movies and I am tough to please when it comes to film, but this film is absolute brilliance. It is flawless. This one earns its 10 and it is one of the best films I have ever seen.  Everything about this film is brilliant. The camera work is great and the score is underrated. However, what makes this film is an absolutely genius screenplay that is acted to perfection. This script will rock your world. I am not Catholic. I didn't grow up in a deeply Catholic area, but this film still affected me greatly. Everyone should see this movie for that reason. That is something that you have to see for yourself.  However, I'd like to focus a little more on the technical aspects. Beyond the fact that the subject matter is heavy and extremely important to American and world culture, this movie does everything else right. The acting is absolutely phenomenal. This is particularly true for Ruffalo and McAdams. I adore the subtlety with which they both act. It is brilliant. There isn't much more to say. This film is pure brilliance from its opening frame to its closing moment. For both cinematic and cultural reasons, this is a film that every person should see.Priests Secretly Committing Pederasty. An Award Winner Reality Movie. Spotlight is a 2015 American biographical drama film directed by Tom McCarthy and written by McCarthy and Josh Singer. The film follows The Boston Globe's "Spotlight" team, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit in the United States, and its investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests. It is based on a series of stories by the real Spotlight Team that earned The Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. The film stars Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, and Billy Crudup. Spotlight was shown in the Out of Competition section of the 72nd Venice International Film Festival. It was also shown at the Telluride Film Festival and the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was released on November 6, 2015, by Open Road Films. It won numerous guilds and critics' association awards, and was named one of the finest films of 2015 by various publications. It is nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Film Editing, Best Supporting Actor: Mark Ruffalo, Best Supporting Actress: Rachel McAdams, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture. In 2001, The Boston Globe hires a new editor, Marty Baron. Baron meets Walter "Robby" Robinson, the editor of the Spotlight team, a small group of journalists writing investigative articles that take months to research and publish. After Baron reads a Globe column about a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, who says that Cardinal Law (the Archbishop of Boston) knew that the priest John Geoghan was sexually abusing children and did nothing to stop him, he urges the Spotlight team to investigate. Journalist Michael Rezendes contacts Garabedian, who initially declines interview. Though he is told not to, Rezendes reveals that he is on the Spotlight team, persuading Garabedian to talk. Initially believing that they are following the story of one priest who was moved around several times, the Spotlight team begin to uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in Massachusetts, and an ongoing cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese. Through a man who heads a victim's rights organization, they widen their search to thirteen priests. They learn through an ex-priest who worked trying to rehabilitate pedophile priests that there should be approximately ninety abusive priests in Boston. Through their research, they develop a list of eighty-seven names, and begin to find their victims to back up their suspicions. When the September 11 attacks occur, the team is forced to deprioritize the story. They regain momentum when Rezendes learns from Garabedian that there are publicly available documents that confirm Cardinal Law was aware of the problem and ignored it. After The Boston Globe wins a case to have even more legal documents unsealed, the Spotlight Team finally begins to write the story, and plan to publish their findings in early 2002. As they are about to go to print, Robinson confesses to the team that he was sent a list of twenty pedophile priests in 1993 in a story he never followed up on. Baron, nevertheless, tells Robinson and the team that the work they are doing is important. The story goes to print with a link leading to the documents that expose Cardinal Law, and a phone number requesting victims of pedophile priests to come forward. The following morning, the Spotlight team is inundated with phone calls from victims coming forward to tell their stories. The film closes with a list of places in the United States and around the world where the Catholic Church has been involved in concealing abuse by priests.Fantastic Movie Filled with Sadness Going into the theater to see Spotlight, I had read the rave reviews and knew I was in for something special. This movie did not disappoint! Being from Boston, this movie really made me think about my life growing up, as a lot of "what ifs" came to mind. "What if" I went to church every Sunday..."what if" I was gullible enough to have a priest lure me into his lair. Spotlight goes straight to the heart of this amazingly sad (and apparently never-ending) saga of the Catholic church and the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims. The acting is all-around fantastic, from Mr. Keaton to some actors that I am not familiar with, which is an aspect of this fine movie that makes it so profound. Tense throughout, I was saddened to hear that this abuse is an epidemic and probably will never be stopped. The exclamation point was when a member of the audience stood up and told the rest of us "...I am a survivor..." WOW...Catholic Church in the Spotlight. Relevant, powerful and astonishing. Shocking, criminal and true. These are the only words to describe this film as it has literally put the 'spotlight' on the systematic cover-up by the Catholic Church of mass molestation and sexual assault acts performed by the priests in the Boston archdiocese that were trusted in the communities they represented. These 'men of God' preyed on the weak and vulnerable for years and the most powerful religious sect in the world did nothing but sweep it under the proverbial carpet. 'Spotlight's' dramatic importance has immediately drawn the attention of film lovers who crave a riveting production that dives deep into a very real circumstance that has impacted every corner of the globe. Tom McCarthy could not have been at the helm of a better film and what he has been able to achieve in terms of wrestling the attentions of the audience is worthy of the highest praise. McCarthy, along with Josh Singer have written a gritty story that pulls no punches and it isn't afraid to get right into the heart of the required subject. For 'Spotlight' to have been received by the critics as well as it has it had to stride unapologetically into this unbelievable and sordid affair. It needed to expose the sensitive and controversial information that some people may find confronting but in the context of this outstanding production, absolutely essential. It destroyed lives and revealed the blatant arrogance of this pious organisation. The all star cast jumps right out at you even before the opening scenes are shot up onto the screen. Based on true events, 'Spotlight' pushes all the right buttons from the beginning. As the name implies, 'Spotlight' refers to the investigative journalism team who report for the Boston Globe newspaper. They are thorough, relentless and will stop at nothing to expose headline stories that affect the everyday lives of normal American's. When the new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), drops a potentially explosive story in the lap of Spotlight chief, Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), about allegations of sexual abuse involving the Catholic Church, Robinson and his loyal crew go about uncovering one of the greatest criminal cover-ups in human history. The deeper their investigation goes the more sadistic and shocking the outcome becomes. Fingers are pointed, people are accused and the list of clergy involved becomes larger and larger. The whole situation ceases to become a Boston problem and grows to a worldwide exposure. Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo are part of the investigative team as young committed journalists Sacha Pfeiffer and Mike Rezendes respectively. McAdams performance is award worthy and Ruffalo is fully engaged in a role that matches his talents. Michael Keaton has found his niche in Hollywood as a sort after mentor showcasing another strong performance as the tenacious and hard hitting Robinson. The real 'cherry' in the cast is the presence of the magnificent Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian who represents the victims in the whole saga. Tucci adds the class that takes 'Spotlight' to another level with an engrossingly accomplished performance. This is the best journalistic drama since 1976's 'All the President's Men'. Tom McCarthy has centred his narrative within the confines of the Boston Globe's newsroom as it should have been. 'Spotlight' doesn't shy away from the true nature of newspaper drama and the audience benefits from such an authentic setting. Top shelf acting from some of the very best young talent sparks the fire that captivates the viewer. Throw in some true icons in Keaton and Tucci and 'Spotlight' has the perfect balance. This film will be classified as the very best in its category and has set a benchmark in terms of confronting realism. Sit back and enjoy.Super film It won best film, deservedly so. This is a film that resonated with me long after I watched it. The complicated tale of the investigation of paedophile priests in Boston and the publication of it is told in riveting fashion by Tom Macarthy who does not waste a frame or a scene to anything less than the plot or character development. I never felt the running time or in any way disbelieved any of the actors in their portrayals. Keaton seems to be on a total roll at the moment and he is excellent as the head of Spotlight but the whole ensemble seemed to put in a real shift. This felt like a documentary at times and I could feel the audience around me leaning forward as each new revelation is uttered.  Just brilliant.I Remembered Why I love Movies Throughout the year I watched many movies and by the middle of the year I was finding it hard to watch a movie. I really had to force my self. I thought my love for movies is dying and I'm more of a TV person now.  I was wrong.  This movie (and the big short) proved to me that it wasn't me, it was actually the movies I've seen this year. This movie has it's flaws for sure. But the acting, script, direction, design and pace of the movie adds a lot to an already strong and heart breaking story. I was on the edge of my seat and even after the movie ended I couldn't move for a while.  A well made film that I recommend to any drama fan. It certainly helped me find my love for movies again. Even with it's flaws I give it a 9.5One of the greatest horror films of all time ... because by the time the credits roll and you start to breathe normally again, you will suddenly realize that this was not a horror film as such, this was a re-enactment of events that actually happened, with real victims and real perpetrators and real well-meaning third parties covering up the whole thing as fast as the body count kept piling up. And then you will once again have difficulty catching your breath. As a film it is superb. McCarthy who did double duty as writer and director deserves acknowledgement. The cast is universally excellent. Ruffalo gives the performance of his career, Keaton is solid as a rock, and McAdams reaps overdue dividends from her decision to broaden her career into non-glamorous roles at a time when the only scripts they were sending her were for Diva parts. Smart lady. A reviewer is not supposed to interject personal feelings in a review but I will say without apology that I miss films like these -- films that speak for the injustice in society and offer solutions -- and wish there were more of them. It seems that when I was younger there was a lot more interest in doing the right thing merely because it was the right thing. This no longer seems to be the societal meme, and that troubles me. A must-see.If there were 90 of these bastards, people would know. It is no secret that I left the Church for many years after they failed to deal with the abuse scandal. Like the Globe personnel, I had no idea of the scope of the problem. I was just angry that those responsible had gotten away with it. The Globe thought this story was worthwhile when they had uncovered 13 priests that abused children. When they discovered it was closer to 90, they were shocked. The eventual number in Boston was 186! This is not surprising when it is estimated that 50% of all priests are not celibate. Mark Ruffalo was amazing in this film, and Rachel McAdams was superb. Neither will likely win awards in a year of fantastic performances, but there is a chance the film may steal an Oscar. It would be a great thing. The film was very difficult for a Catholic to watch, but it was definitely worth it. Unlike the recent documentary, Mea Maxima Culpa, it focused on the Globe and the story, and not the abuse.Flat Out Remarkable! Possibly the Year's Best! Seconds after the credits for Tom McCarthy's "Spotlight" roll, an overwhelming feeling of changing your career takes over. Is film criticism really where I belong? What important, life-changing story am I not writing about? Truth is, quite a bit of classic films give off that same feeling. "Rocky" made a bunch of our fathers and older brothers go for a morning run and drink raw eggs. "Rudy" made us want to go out and play Notre Dame football. "Spotlight" makes you want to go down to your local courthouse and search the public records for clues. Then, get on the phone, with a pen and a pad, and start asking some really tough questions. Honestly speaking, "Spotlight" is the best investigative news drama this century. Matter of fact, behind "All the President's Men" and maybe "The Insider," it's among the best ever made. "Spotlight" tells the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core. Where you must begin, with any praise for the film, is the audacious and fortifying script by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer. The two create cinematic magic in their articulation of words, characters, and narrative storytelling. Each person feels authentic. Each scene feels rich and equally important as the last. And most of all, its the tightest, most satisfying film from beginning to end, seen this year. From minute one, you're hooked, up until the last second, where they decide the last words spoken should be, "Spotlight" is astonishingly crafted. I'm still in shock and awe that Tom McCarthy is the one who made this. This is a writer/director who I've appreciated but didn't have the "love" factor surrounding any of his films. Paired with an outstanding cast, co-writer Josh Singer, editor Tom McArdle, cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi and composer Howard Shore, Tom McCarthy gets a chance to create his masterpieceand succeeds. He makes brilliant artistic choices, such as letting a Mark Ruffalo letter reading play over a 2-minute taxi car ride back to the newspaper. McCarthy's direction is one of the best directorial efforts from any filmmaker this year thus far. All the players performing are top-notch but walking away, best-in- show, is the performance of Academy Award nominee Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo exhibits his best screen performance to date, and makes a stake in his claim for the Oscar this year. Weirdly reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's work in "The Master," Ruffalo builds his 'Mike' from the feet up, giving him his own characteristics that I'm not sure McCarthy and Singer set out to do. His expressions in words, mannerisms, all encapsulate the magnitude of his work, bookended by an explosive scene that brought tears to my eyes. Think back to Emma Stone's acclaimed work in "Birdman," and the scene that made everyone notice. I wanted to simply applaud. Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams, who play "Robbie" and "Sacha" respectively, are attune with their characters and destinations. Each bring strong sensibilities and sensitivity to their roles that desperately call for them. Hotly worked into the story is Liev Schreiber as a newly appointed Editor, that in the little screen time he's given, makes a long-lasting impression. Stanley Tucci is also afforded the same opportunity, and gives one of the film's best monologues. If there's a film this year that feels like an Oscar-winner, "Spotlight" sure does make a compelling case. Dramatic, heart- pounding, and necessarily made. It's one of the most important films this year and probably THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR. The Telluride tradition may continue.All the Vatican's Men in Outstanding Investigative Journalism Film Revealing the Skeletons in the Boston Archdiocese's Closet In "All the President's Men", young reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered a national political scandal when they, through their investigative journalism, revealed the White House under then President Richard Nixon was using campaign funding to finance dirty tricks of political enemies, nicknamed Watergate. In "Spotlight", a similar team of investigative reporters reveal a scandal of epic proportions which makes much of the Watergate scandal seem tame by comparison. They uncovered widespread sexual abuse of minors committed by priests of the Roman Catholic Church who, in turn, hid the crimes. Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Walter V. Robinson (Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Martin "Marty" Baron (Leiv Schreiber), Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) work for a group of investigative reporters within the Boston Globe called "Spotlight" who succeed in finding the skeletons in the Boston Diocese proverbial closet. For many years prior to the sexual abuse scandal, Spotlight had investigated and reported on many other ground-breaking stories. The story begins with a quick flash-back to 1976 when a priest is jailed for sexual abusing a minor. The film then cuts to 2001. Marty Baron (Schreiber), a Jewish Floridian, becomes the main editor for the Boston Globe. He meets the different editors and journalists, and learns of work by Spotlight. A Globe column reveals a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, claims Cardinal Law, then Archbishop of Boston, knew Father John Geoghan, a priest within Law's diocese, was sexually abusing children, and the bishop did not bring him to the attention of authorities. Baron urges the Spotlight team to investigate further to see whether the claim is true and an isolated incident, or if there is more to the story. The "seed" is similar to the break-in of the democratic headquarters at the Watergate Complex which eventually revealed the Nixon White House had been engaging in multiple plots against perceived political enemies. The Spotlight team is headed by Walter "Robby" Robinson (Keaton), a no-nonsense fair but tough reporter/editor. They agree to Baron's wishes and begin researching deeper to see if there is a larger story. Their first lead is the attorney mentioned in the article, Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci). Rezendes (Ruffalo) peruses Garabedian who acted as negotiator between the Boston Archdiocese and victims of Father Geoghan. The reporter wishes the attorney to reveal names of the victims, but at first Garabedian declines. Eventually, Garabedian agrees to contact victims, who are now much older, and ask them if they are willing to speak with Rezendes without revealing their names. Eventually, interviews are set up at the attorney's offices. The question then becomes whether there were other priests who engaged in similar criminal behavior against minors. On another front, other members of the team, including Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams), begin discovering the unspeakable reality of other victims possibly at the hands of more priests, aside from Geoghan. Then a tip from a former rehabilitation counselor for priests informs the team that, based on statistics, there may be as many as 90 priests involved with sexual abuse of children in the Boston Area alone. The team then appropriates volumes of an American guide book of Roman Catholic priests, published once a year, which lists the whereabouts of every clergyman in the church in terms of dioceses and parishes. The investigators make a startling discovery. Certain names in the book over several years are listed as "on leave due to illness", "on administrative leave", or other designations of inactivity after only one to three years at a particular parish, leading the team to consider these may be priests who engaged in sexual misconduct with minors. If true, it would place blame not only on Cardinal Law as possibly covering up the church's indiscretions but the entire Roman Catholic Church, all the way to the Vatican. This is a stunning film about the power of a small group of urban reporters to uncover wrongdoing by one of the oldest and far-reaching institutions in the world: The Roman Catholic Church. In particular high marks for Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes, Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer, and Michael Keaton as Robbie Robinson. So much of the story parallels the Watergate Scandal of several decades earlier. As horrible as the actual victimization of minors by the priests, often boys because they were less likely to "squeal" because of the shame, the cover-up by Law was nearly as criminal. Instead of taking the priests to justice, as he should have done, he tried to cover it up by offering settlements to the families, often when the victims were minors. Law and probably other church officials moved the priests to other parishes where they engaged in similar behavior, thus allowing widespread sexual abuse to continue. It was eventually revealed that not only did these sexual predators victimize children in other parts of the country, it was happening internationally.Wonderful drama about the importance of investigative journalism Everything about this movie is outstanding -- the performances, the way the true events are handled, the cinematography. In this day of digital news, this movie makes us stand back and realize what we may lose in the way of investigative journalism as we slowly kill off print media. The lengths the directors go to to achieve a sense of authenticity is remarkable. We are there in Boston in 2001-2002. We get to know enough about each character to make him or her real, but not enough to create side dramas. The focus remains the child abuse scandal in the archdiocese in Boston. That reflects the conflict the characters face and deal with when events make them rethink the focus of their article. The movie is riveting, though we know the outcome.Very relevant and important, but not very good "Spotlight" is an American movie from last year that runs for slightly over 2 hours and was written and directed by Tom McCarthy. It won two Academy Awards earlier this year, including the grand prize for Best Picture. And the reason for this is probably that it is about a really important subject, namely the way it was discovered by a major newspaper that pedophilia was something that existed on a larger scale in the Church, despite many attempts of the latter to keep it disclosed. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams managed Oscar nominations for their supporting performances. I cannot say I agree with either sadly. McAdams played her part well, had a couple good moments, but I don't think it was one of the best of the year in her category. Probably more of a coattail nomination, I remember it was also pretty surprising she got in. Ruffalo's nomination was no surprise, he got in at all the precursors too. But I had sometimes problems with his performance. It seem over-the-top theatrical and it had a touch of one man against the Church at times, which went entirely against the idea of the team collaboratively managing great things. I am usually a fan of Ruffalo and he has good moments here too, but I think a mix of not so good writing and perhaps not the best approach to the role may have hurt the character. Keaton, Tucci, Slattery and Schreiber are pretty much the same, good but not great, but probably on par with the two nominees. It was a team effort and nobody really stood out. In terms of the entire film, I summarized it appropriately in the title I believe. It is a very important subject and it was a strong cast making this subject work with dignity and professionalism, but I personally felt the heart was missing. And this subject certainly would have deserved to make a more emotional impact in the grand scheme of things than it did on me. The attempts by McCarthy to deliver in terms of that were something that felt rather forced than effective to me. They brought in references to the journalists' private lives and how it impacted them to some extent, but it did not feel too compelling to me to watch these and the victims also did not add as much as I hoped they would. The ending with Keaton's "Spotlight" quote was nicely done though. I also liked the way they brought in 9/11 getting in the way of disclosing the events. Overall, I believe this is an important movie that is worth watching mostly because it all happened in reality and because with the Best Picture win, it is probably now the defining film on a very contemporary and tragic occurrence of events. But I still feel it did not make the impact that it could have made and my favorite McCarthy film to this day stays "The Visitor". But I recommend "Spotlight" too of course. I would say it's nowhere near the best or worst Best Picture Academy Award winners.A good docu-drama but nothing more I liked this film, thought it was a well done solid film. But I am afraid I can't say anything more than that, it is very documentary like which can be it's biggest strength (a very fact driven plot heavy film) or it's biggest weakness (characters feel cold and distant and other than the plot nothing really impresses, also quite bland in the visuals department). However the characters do start to show some life nearing the end of the film but by that time damage is done it can be hard if not impossible for viewers to differentiate between the reporters for nearly one and a half hour of the film, they all suffer from different faces but same objective syndrome and inadequate effort is made to separate one from the another. Also speaking of run-time, this film is a wee bit over two hours long, editing especially in the first half could have made this film a bit crispier. However I did like the accuracy level in the film regarding the cellphones, ads, electronics and the cars used in 2001; a lot of films these days are becoming very careless in this regard. I would compare it to last year's Foxcatcher another fact driven docu-drama film, solidly acted, but nothing special in the direction, editing and cinematography department, I would still recommend it but no way this film deserves a second watch, you can absorb everything there is to get in a single viewing. All in all, a solid well written docu-drama which will have it's time in the "spotlight" (pun!) this Oscar season and will become "oh that movie about pedo priests" by next year's Oscar season.A fine film but not worthy of winning Best Picture Going into 'Spotlight' I was aware that it was the front runner to win Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. After having seen it I can't really understand why. That's not to say it wasn't a good film, it simply didn't blow me away at all. It told a story, an admittedly fascinating and true story, in an informative way but it didn't do anything that great films do like inspire me, move me or leave me stunned with the powerful nature it was told with. Best Picture winners of the past, like 'Schindler's List', told true stories but also encompassed all three of those traits and plenty more. That was a film I will never forget, 'Spotlight' will probably be completely out of my mind by this time next week. Frankly, I was a little underwhelmed with the lack of emotion such a serious subject brought out in me. The film just didn't really seem to try to do that. It felt more like a documentary reenactment, simply with very fine actors, than anything else. My disagreement with it likely winning Best Picture aside, there are some very fine filmmaking skills on show here in all departments. Director Tom McCarthy, in only his fifth turn at directing, has been nominated for a Best Directing award. While I don't like the lack of emotion his storytelling brought out in me, he clearly had a vision to tell a story in a certain way, and he got it done. He tells it in a punchy fashion that never allows the audience to drift off. The Best Directing race this year is a tight one with four of the five all being widely in contention. I don't think McCarthy will get the win however, as his film doesn't have the "X-Factor" going for it that a lot of the others do. Having said that, any film that wins Best Picture has to get some real credit for its director, so don't completely rule him out if it does indeed win that. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams have also been nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Actress awards. I have trouble understanding how, to again be frank. Roles based on real life characters always get more attention than others but these two had absolutely nothing to work with in the script. They were almost never given a chance to shine in any scene. Because of this I don't believe either has a chance of winning their respective award. It wasn't a film designed to make actors look good. Having said that, the stand out performance for me was Michael Keaton. He almost won the Best Actor award last year and this year can't even get a nomination. Had his been considered a Supporting Role I'm sure he would have but it was probably considered in that "in between" state, which may have hurt him. There are a lot of true stories at this year's Acadmey Awards and I think 'Spotlight' is benefiting from being the most interesting story of them all. 'The Big Short' is another case of an interesting true story, however that was told in a very unique and clever way. Interestingly, that is the biggest competition 'Spotlight' will have when the winner is read out on the night. My fingers might just be crossed on the seeing the upset.Oscar-Bait Crumbling Under Its Worth Spotlight is based on the true story of a Boston Globe editorial team's efforts to uncover systematic child abuse and abuser protection by the Catholic Church. Hardly fresh news, and a topic that will raise strong emotional reactions, and rightly so. But how does it hold up? Given the weird emotional volatility surrounding this one, allow me to qualify this review (and its writer): the scandal revisited here is unarguably heinous, as are the many people who took part in perpetuating it. My own feelings about organized religion mean I was only mildly surprised, but then perhaps the subject of the clergy's hypocrisy is worth revisiting, as it has been in entertainment since Moliere's Tartuffe. But this is a film website, the medium is narrative film, and so Spotlight should - and shall, in the longer term - be judged. This is a film that owes its success and Oscar nominations to its topic and, to a lesser extent, to its ensemble cast. It is also a throw-back to harder-nosed journalism-based films like All The President's Men - a much better, less self-righteous film. The end result however is a bit awkward: first, the structure is wobbly, throwing us in headfirst and assuming perhaps too much familiarity with the events. The character introductions are very rushed, which means it takes more time to build empathy, especially when it comes to the victims. The climax, such as it is, and ensuing denouement are a bit limp culminating in the obligatory white text on black background to tell you succinctly with words what the filmmakers could not achieve with visuals. It makes you wish, as many reviewers have, that this were a documentary. The cast are uniformly good, with Stanley Tucci and Mark Buffalo the stand-outs, but these are solid, seasoned turns, nothing that cries out "best performance of the year". Technical credits are closer to a TV-movie than a major Hollywood release. I can't give it credit merely for tackling an easy target from such a safe distance, but I would concede more points if it told its story more fluidly and dared to explore some of the more dangerous angles a bit more, such as police collusion, or that one memorable scene where a guilty priest rationalizes what he did in a way that hints at even worse events. Sadly, this chooses to play things way too safe.Spotlight is the Best Film of 2015 "Spotlight" is the best film of 2015 and I will be disappointed if it does not receive the Academy Award for Best Picture. As good as it is, it is just one step short of greatness.  "Spotlight" depicts Boston Globe reporters investigating priest sex abuse of children. "Spotlight" focuses like a laser on what it is to be a journalist, to consider whether or not to cover a story, to select it, to research it, to uncover piece-by-piece, a full narrative, to publish it and to live with the consequences of publication.  You don't learn about the reporter's personal lives except for what you see incidentally as they work at home. There is no romantic subplot; there are no trumped-up action scenes where a reporter punches a priest. There's actually one of those scenes, no doubt a self- conscious salute to classic newspaper films, where you see newspapers being run through one of those giant machines that rapidly prints, folds, and stacks hard copies.  I've never seen a film in which I liked these actors more: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian D'Arcy James, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, Len Cariou. Lesser known actors in minor roles are every bit as good. There is no Hollywood in these performances. There's no sexy costumes or makeup, no grandstanding for the Academy. The actors are dressed in the workaday attire of newspapermen and women. Much of the film takes place in a grubby shared office full of sloppy manila file folders or in cafes and working class neighborhoods where informants are interviewed. Each performer plays a cog in a giant wheel working to uncover evil. None of them knows about world-shaking scandal still to come, or Pulitzer Prizes. They are just, with a pair of tweezers, turning over one leaf and seeing what lies beneath and adding that to the information already gathered. Even though viewers already know how this story played out in real life, the audience gasps when a discovery is made; the audience fears that a rock will be thrown through a window; the audience fears that judicial complicity will keep the story hidden. I began crying half an hour into the film. I was crying at the end. I made audible "Huh!" noises at especially and outrageously ironic moments, as did others in the audience. We applauded at the film's conclusion.  The film opens with a child in a police station, accompanied by his parents and a priest. A lawyer enters. Everyone speaks in hushed tones. "I promise this will never happen again." The police are cynical. The lawyer is smooth. The child is crushed. The parents are heartbroken. The priest appears slickly demonic. The scene is anonymous. Events like this were repeated at least a thousand times.  July, 2001. The Boston Globe acquires its first Jewish editor, Martin Baron. The Spotlight team is considering following up a case of priestly sex abuse. Slowly but surely, they discover that there are far more incidences than suspected. They discover not just one bad apple here and there. Rather, Cardinal Law has reassigned abusive priests to new parishes. Baron meets with Law. Law presents Baron with a copy of the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  "Spotlight" mentions "Good Germans" – people who kept their eyes closed to the disappearance of their Jewish neighbors, and the sudden appearance of ash falling from the sky. Just so, there were many "Good Bostonians." It's sickening to confront the many who had awareness of priestly sex abuse and did nothing. Targeted kids were powerless and without allies. One had a schizophrenic mother. Some had absentee fathers. Some were gay. Many were from the wrong side of the tracks. After they were abused, some became alcoholics, drug addicts, or suicides. When SNAP activist Phil Saviano is invited to the Boston Globe's office, and he talks about a conspiracy to protect abusive priests that stretches all the way to the Vatican, he comes across as a twitchy, obnoxious, conspiracy theorist raving about Area 51 – someone easy to write off.  The most nauseating reason of all given for ignoring clergy sex abuse: money. The Globe could have covered clergy sex abuse earlier, but it didn't. Over fifty percent of the paper's subscribers are Catholics. Boston is a small town, with a lot of insular Irish Catholics who don't want anyone rocking the boat, or risking various money streams, including the church's significant charity work.  Especially poignant are the scenes where abuse survivors are encouraged to detail what happened to them. "It's not enough to say he molested you. You must give me the clinical details of exactly what happened," reporters insist, to sobbing survivors, who must then re- inhabit their worst memories.  The plot churns forward with the single line of a freight train running on schedule. I was never bored.  The priestly sex abuse crisis is not a tragedy because the Catholic Church is corrupt. The priestly sex abuse crisis is a tragedy because the Catholic Church is great. The film could have become better than it is had it included this theme. Show Catholics feeding the homeless. Show Catholics recovering from grief with the support of their faith. Show Cardinal Law for what he once was – a courageous hero in the Civil Rights movement, when that meant receiving death threats and alienating the powerful. That something so beautiful is so sullied, along with individual victims' pain, is the heart of this tragedy.  I am a lifelong, church-going Catholic. I present my reasons for being Catholic, in spite of everything, in my book "Save Send Delete." I salute, not boycott, the Globe's reporting, and films like this. Confession and redemption are gifts we shared with the world.Faith Greetings again from the darkness. Faith. A word that easily could have been the title of this gripping and heart-wrenching film. Faith can be defined as trust and belief. Faith can also be defined as religion and ideology. Few things are more devastating than broken faith  the core of this "based on actual events" story of The Boston Globe's exposure of rampant child molestation by dozens of Catholic priests, and the systematic cover-up by "The Church". It's challenging to name a movie that is as well-made as this one, while also being as difficult to watch. We know the story  we even know how it snow-balled globally  but the raw emotions of disgust and sheer anger permeate much of our being as we watch it unfold on screen. Director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent, The Visitor) co-wrote the script with Josh Singer (The Fifth Estate) and it's worthy of favorable comparison to other investigative newspaper films like The Insider (1999), Zodiac (2007), and even the granddaddy of them all  All The President's Men (1976). The opening scene takes place in a 1976 Boston police station. A priest has been accused of molesting a child. Within a couple of minutes we witness the empty promises, the intimidation, and the cover up. So much is conveyed in this brief opener, not the least of which comes courtesy of the ambivalence of the veteran cop as he shrugs it off as 'just another day' in front of an idealistic rookie cop. This is accompanied by Howard Shore's spot-on score, with the best parts featuring only a piano and bass. Flash forward to 2001 as we meet the investigative journalist team called "Spotlight". It's led by editor Walter "Robby" Robinson (Michael Keaton) and his three reporters: Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfieffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). They report to Ben Bradlee Jr (John Slattery), whose father was the editor of The Washington Post during the Woodward/Bernstein/Watergate era. New to The Globe is managing editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber). Unlike the others, Mr. Baron is neither a Boston local nor a Catholic. In fact, we catch him reading Dan Shaughnessy's book "The Curse of the Bambino", just so he can get a better feel for the community and its people. What is most fascinating about the movie is that it focuses on the investigative aspects – just how diligent the reporters were in putting the story together – and how fluid the process was  the story led them, not vice versa. There was no media agenda to "get" the church. Instead, the reporters experienced natural shock as each piece of the puzzle was discovered. One of their key sources was a priest-turned-psychologist (voiced by Richard Jenkins) who helped them put scope to the numbers. Another was Phil Saviano (Neal Huff), the leader of a victim's group, who had tried before to provide documentation to the press. Saviano is the perfect example of how someone so passionate about a cause can be viewed with such skepticism  right up to the point when they are proved correct. Three attorneys add perspective to the cover-up. Eric Macleish (Billy Crudup) made a career of settling cases (and silencing victims) for the church. Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) is the polar opposite – he fights vigorously to get the victims heard, while Jim Sullivan (Jamey Sheridan) is caught in the middle – settling cases for the church and struggling with his conscience. Other interesting characters include Paul Guilfoyle as Pete Conley, a smooth-talking power-broker for the church, and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law – the man at the top who eventually apologized and was rewarded with a high-ranking position at The Vatican. The film is so well crafted and acted that it features more than a few "best scenes". Sacha has a brief encounter with a former priest on his front door stoop. The priest freely admits to molesting kids and his rationalization will certainly deliver chills to most any viewer. Since this is Boston, it makes perfect sense for the reporters to be so distracted by the story, that it supersedes the Red Sox game they are attending at Fenway Park. Being that the investigation lasted well into 2001, it's quite informative to watch a news agency shift directions for the September 11 tragedy, and along with the nation, put all else on hold. Finally, there is a point in the movie where we as viewers have just about had our fill of extreme emotions – we either need to hit something or throw up – and reporter Rezendes comes through with exactly what is needed: an emotional outburst and release of exasperation rivaling anything previously seen on screen. It's a wonderful moment for Ruffalo as an actor, and a peak moment for viewers. The story hit the front page of The Boston Globe in January 2002. The paper won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for its superlative investigative journalism. The report vindicated so many who had been taken advantage of, and exposed the colossal arrogance of the church. The innocence of a child vs the power of God. The story broke the faith that so many once held, and started a global (as evidenced by the closing credits) reckoning and awakening that was desperately needed. The film offers a line of dialogue, "It takes a village to raise a kid  or abuse one." In other words, it took the often silent actions of so many to allow this despicably evil horror to continue. In a tribute to the newspaper profession, it took a small group of dedicated reporters to pull back a curtain that should never again be shut. Let's have faith in that.Exceptional Movie About Reporters Reporting The awards season may just have found its first forerunner. In a 2015 movie year that has been average at best without any standout films initiating awards conversation, Tom McCarthy's Spotlight rising above the heap to assert itself as one of 2015's best. With an all-star cast including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup, Spotlight shines a light on a 2001 investigation by The Boston Globe's on the sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. Michael Keaton plays Walter Robinson who leads the Globe's investigative unit with Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Sacha (McAdams) and Matt Carrol (Brian d'Arcy James). Under a new editor Marty Baron (Schreiber), the team begins to unfold a horrific pattern of child sexual abuse by the church that was muted and covered up by high priced lawyers and payoffs to victim's families. As Walter probes further and further into the events (the setting is after the events the 9/11) the investigation reveals layers and layers of injustice of Catholic Priests that were aided by the highest powers of the church in an effort to keep the story muted. It all starts with a featured column about Catholic priest John Geoghan who was accused of abusing over 100 boys. A civil suit is filed but the details of the abuse were ordered sealed by the courts. Schrieber's Baron puts the team of reporters on the case and within days the evil that lurked with the sacred rooms of local churches begins to reveal is foul and despicable face. The investigation goes on for months as the team hits roadblock upon roadblock taking one step forward for every two steps back. But the story eventually breaks and the emotionally exhausted team is eventually able to bring to light one of the more depressing and important stories of the early new century. Michael Keaton was really good in last year's Birdman and named himself many awards and an Academy Award nomination for his part. In Spotlight, he may be even better. Under the direction of Tom McCarthy (Win Win, The Station Agent), Keaton shines and carries a performance of determination, frustration and redemption that is delivered with precision. Nods to All the President's Men will be inevitable. But that was a different era. A different movie. Spotlight is fresh and invigorating in its painfully frustrating subject matter. Audiences should leave with a renewed belief that investigative reporting is of monumental importance and that stories such as the one originating in 2001 Massachusetts are still out there clouded in red tape secrecy and muffled whispers. It is painful to watch at times. Trusted bonds between people, children, parents and the institution that promotes the opposite to what it sometimes preaches are disgusting revelations that are brought to the screen with sizzling effects. The entire cast from top to bottom is perfectly cast. And McCarthy doesn't populate his frames with unnecessary spectacular visuals. Spotlight is instead very straight forward. Focused and driven. Spotlight will be nominated for Best Picture and Keaton should get a nod for Actor. Ruffalo may also sneak his way onto ballot sheets. But whether Spotlight wins any hardware is unimportant as long as we recognize the importance of films such as these. A few years ago I would guess that 99% of the population knew nothing about the Iran hostage rescue highlighted in Ben Affleck's Argo. Spotlight should have the same effect acting as a docudrama that is both highly entertaining and educational at the same time. It is both a very good film and an important one. http://theintestinalfortitude.com/The Spotlight of films In the past 5+ years, I've read articles about the decline of cinema and the great successes of Television. There's no denying that there have been some wonderful TV/web series in recent years, but I think a film like Spotlight is the refresh button that moviegoers have been looking for. The story is compelling, the acting is unnoticeable, and the script seems to flow the way a real conversation would. The writers and director of this film are the "Spotlight" of filmmaking, opening up a sensitive story that people acknowledged but probably couldn't imagine on screen, and they brought it to us in a way where I felt all the emotions of someone finding out the truth for the first time. I watched Spotlight at the Zürich Film Festival and after 2 hours, thought it ended too soon. The only negative thing I could think of was that those French &amp; German subtitles were really getting in the way. Maybe next time, the director could remove those ;)Compelling Subject, Average Film The film Spotlight plays like an average Joe type of movie. There is no inspiring cinematography or unique dialogue floating off the screen. It's a clean cut film about a team of reporters who decide to expose Priests molesting children in Boston- and later, we learn, all over the world. It takes place in 2001, right when the internet was just starting to replace print journalism as the new way people read their news. As the story opens, we learn that a section of the Boston Globe- the movie's title- is suffering from low ratings and no readers. The new boss that is hired to direct the team asks the Editor of Spotlight, Michael Keaton, how long it will take for the next story to unfold.  "A few months, maybe more." Keaton says casually. This does not make his boss very enthused. The rest of the team, which includes Mark Ruffalo as an eager reporter, and Rachel McAdams as a bland one - begin digging for clues and interviewing victims of the Priests around town. Other people in town refuse to address the topic. Stanley Tucci, who is very good, eventually lets Ruffalo interview a victim who goes into deep detail on how his molestation took place. It's rather uncomfortable to hear, but necessary. McAdams also has interviews like this, and soon everybody wants the story to release. But then September 11th hits and they decide to wait. And wait longer.  While the subject matter of the movie is very interesting, I found the movie to be an uninspiring showcase of events save some strong performances- Ruffalo and Tucci are the best in show. Keaton is okay but nothing to write home about. And Rachel McAdams has NEVER been so dull. Why she's the only one in Oscar consideration is beyond me; her character lacks any personality other then to speak like a dial tone and be the sole female on the team. She can do better than this. But because the script is dominated by male personalities (and screenwriters), what more do you expect? Is this the Best Picture of 2015? According to many sources, yes. It's the default, safe choice because allegedly voters aren't going to want to crown far more intriguing movies like The Martian, Mad Max, Brooklyn or Room- to name a few titles I found far more exhilarating. It's an okay attempt to tell this important story about a corrupt justice system and of course the Catholic Church in general. But it's stale when it comes to the artistry.  FINAL GRADE: CThis is why modern civilization is based on freedom of press "Spotlight" is one of the best realistic and serious movies of recent years. I don't want to tell the story, as you will watch it soon or later, but I want to admire the movie and the content itself. Instead of falling into the stereotypical hero and anti-hero type of movies, the movie narrates the story with realistic characters, sensual REALISTIC emotions and incredibly depicts the integrity and handwork of the Boston Globe investigation team. The acting of Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton are great. Finally, the movie does not fall into the category of twisty blockbusters but a realistic movie about an important subject that anyone will admire.Solid Film Lacking Dramatic Punch This was a solid drama elevated by superior acting from a top-notch cast but I left the theater somewhat underwhelmed. The movie lacked the sort of drama that makes you wonder how the story will end even when you know how the story will end. The main problem is that the Catholic Church just doesn't come across as a particularly forceful adversary. We're told that the Church is so powerful and has kept the abuse hidden for decades, but when a group of reporters actually goes digging they encounter some roadblocks but nothing that gives you the sense that the Church was something to be feared. While I didn't necessarily need Cardinal Law to dispatch some Opus Dei goons to discourage the reporters and the victims, the movie would have been more rewarding if they'd encountered much stronger resistance from the Church, public officials, and their own family and friends.Good cast, well-acted, but.... As several other reviewers have stated here, Spotlight is a "solid" film. There is absolutely no fault with the actors, who all acquit themselves very well, and the movie itself never drags. However, there's really no character in the movie whom the audience can latch onto. It's a terrific ensemble, but the fault, I think, lies in trying to give everyone in the ensemble an equal part in the story. Without making it about one person (whether a reporter or a victim), the emotional impact falls very, very short. What the viewer is left with is a general notion of, "It's shocking that went on for so long and the church kept covering it up," but zero emotional investment and reaction. Unless you have a personal identification with any of the elements in this story, I think you will remain similarly aloof in regards to this film.Well assembled ensemble As we know Spotlight pulled off something of an upset at the 2015 Oscars by winning for Best Picture. It might have not been my first choice, still it is a good film dealing with a most distasteful subject, molestation by Roman Catholic priests of minors. For centuries the priesthood has been a refuge for closeted gay men who were then never questioned about their lack of interest in women. Then along came Stonewall and gay liberation and chances undreamed of for gays to live openly. So there was no longer a need to enter the priesthood. That caused a lot of vacancies and to this day the Catholic Church has never filled all the openings. Secondly celibacy is just one insane requirement. Back 1000 years ago when it was introduced we never knew about libidos and sex drives. For some with low or no sex drive it's no big deal. But some of us have needs. Put it together you have a recipe for pedophilia. Not that this wasn't known. Back in my younger days I knew a family that numbered a priest among a few brothers. This individual while an ordained priest ran for NYS Assembly. But one day we heard he was transferred to a new parish on an Indian reservation in the southwest. That was a favorite dumping ground for priests from the New York Archdiocese who got caught and were in too many parishes. Cardinal Francis J. Spellman's favorite exile place.  Maybe Cardinal Bernard Law if he knew about what Spellman did he might have put off what happened to his Archdiocese in Boston. This all started with the expose of one Father John Geoghan who was transferred to many parishes in the Archdiocese after it got out he had a taste for young boys.  What the team of investigative reporters from the Boston Globe did was tell the wider story and the film is their search for evidence. The film is always compared with All The President's Men and how the Washington Post broke the Watergate story. One big difference is that a couple of high powered box office names in Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford led the cast. No big names in Spotlight's cast, just a well assembled ensemble.  In fact two of the cast Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams were nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. You might well ask the question, who were they in support of? Spotlight is a good film, not a great one, but it has a few moments. One that is unforgettable for me is Rachel McAdams on the trail of her story going to the house of a former priest. If there were an award for brief significant performances category than Richard O'Rourke as the defrocked priest would have got it for that year. Watch Rachel's reactions as O'Rourke who is so clearly not emotionally developed starts talking of his experiences. Then he's cut off from McAdams by his sister played by Nancy Carroll who is protective of her child like brother and orders her off the premises. That scene told you a lot about many who went into that vocation. I don't think the great film on the subject has yet been made. But Spotlight will do until it is.Great story, underpowered film The story of this film needs no explanation. It is a very powerful subject and sometimes it makes me wonder how these subjects are allowed in Hollywood. Corruption is everywhere. With the internet expanding and our view of the news changing, as depicted in the film, we have been discovering such stories more and more. The film's execution of its serious subject was not as powerful as it needed it to be. There was only subtle criticism of the Church and the subject of sexual abuse. There should have been more vivid and effective ways of criticizing the behaviour and the cover-up. I don't know if this is even possible considering the power of religious institutions; it might not have been possible to do much more, so we can't blame without knowing the truth. This is not the only reason why I found the film underperformed. The acting was weak, excluding Mark Ruffalo. And I couldn't find myself getting into the story as much as I would've expected to. The story and the subject along with Ruffalo's performance saved this film to be above average. Still, I would recommend it for the story.Compelling, Chilling and Cold-Hard Truth. As a Roman Catholic who attends mass weekly I thought I knew all about the child abuse scandal within the RC' Church and well after watching 'Spotlight' it is certainly safe to say I didn't know the half of it. This fantastically compelling, yet chilling, title has really opened my eyes and educated me on the investigation that the journalists of the Boston Globe's Spotlight Team carried out between 2001 &amp; 2002. Putting the fantastic script and acting aside, my credit goes to the real life journalists. The emotional side effects this investigation would have caused them is hard to think about, but exposing the truth must have been very worthwhile.  Watching the film I found it hard at first to understand how this could happen and how a priest could abuse a child within a parish. But the film follows the investigation very carefully and answered every question going around in my head at the time of watching it and revealed everything I wanted to know and more.  I don't want to give away too much in my review, but I will say this. If you are like me and think that you know what had happened in the child abuse scandal I would urge you to think again and watch this film. That's all I will say.  With regards to the actual film? Well its fantastic. The camera work, the acting, the script...everything about this film is compelling and is sure to glue your eyes to that TV screen (or what ever device you happen to watch on). In the end I am happy that I took the time to watch this, it was very informative and has educated me greatly on the situation and made me think about a lot of things, not regarding my faith, it is still as strong as ever, but regarding the Roman Catholic Church and its hierarchy etc.  Anyway, I'm going to stop talking, give it a watch, be informed and enjoy every minute of this chilling, compelling and informative thriller/drama. 10/10Been there, done that. I haven't seen the film. When I was 10, my favorite, Father Eddy died. This joker showed up, all puffed up &amp; told me, "Father Eddy's dead, I'm here NOW." I'm surprised I didn't crack a tooth. I said to myself, "he must DIE!!!!" I smiled as sweetly as I could &amp; asked him, if Jesus was the creator of the universe, why couldn't he create cheeseburgers for the disciples? He turned white as a sheet &amp; ran from the room.  I later learned he had his sorry ass thrown in jail for molesting boys on the football team. Good thing he didn't try it with me. I regularly beat their sorry asses, &amp; he was a little wimp of a thing. I'd of turned him into guacamole dip. So, it's a little too close to home for my comfort. My cousin said that guy molested him.masterpiece In July 2001, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) is the new editor of the Boston Globe. He wants Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton) to investigate lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) who represents victims of Catholic priests. Robby leads Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) in the Globe's investigative journalism group called Spotlight. This is tightly produced procedural of a newspaper investigation like "All the President's Men". I have no problem with anybody putting this in the same league as that iconic classic. It is that good. It is that relevant. The acting is superior. There is not a lot of flash. It is a lot of shoe-leather work and this movie presents it with great tension and integrity. This is a masterpiece.Superbly Executed Film: A New Gold Standard for Films About Investigative Journalists Spotlight is the best film of its kind I have ever seen. All the President's Men was the gold standard for this kind of film about investigative journalism, along with Absence of Malice, but this film was better in several respects: First, it did a superior job talking about the multiple levels at which the story could be presented by the journalists: about the victims, the priest/pedophiles, Cardinal Law, or the Catholic Church cover-up; Second, it laid out the conflict among the journalists about when to run with the story and why better than any film of its kind. Third, it presented the notion that the story could have a very different effect if it ran in one part of the paper than another. The idea that a story could be "buried," even though it was published, because it was presented in the Metropolitan section, instead of the front page was well presented. Fourth, the conflict among the journalists seemed real, not staged, as far as how to proceed with the story. Fifth, the reasons people chose not to cooperate were well presented. People who had genuinely positive feelings about the Catholic Church were well-rounded characters, and the tension about threatening a Catholic high school with allegations about one of its faculty members was great. Stories like this have unintended consequences, and this film did a superb job laying them out. Finally, the visuals were superb. The juxtaposition of the horrific events being presented and the ordinary working and middle class neighborhoods in which they were happening was presented without being overemphasized. All in all, a wonderful movie, which, I predict, will be a classic like All the President's Men for people who want to watch intelligent films.Great Job A group of journalists runs the movie who's working on child abuse allegations on few church fathers. And police try to cover up the issue.  What I liked most about the movie? It successfully highlighted child abuse issue WITHOUT even showing child in compromised situation. Great Job! Story is well knit and over all the story may sound boring at times but such phase will pass quickly.  The movie proved that you can talk about as issue without showing it happening, which can be devastating for victims and people belong to that group.Spotlight Delivers No question that this Academy Award winning film Spotlight is one of the best films not only during the year it was released but for many years to come. This Oscar winner which features the Boston Globe's "Spotlight" team tells us us how the oldest continuously operating newspaper's group of investigative journalist unit in the United States came up with its investigation of the cases of pederasty that committed by numerous Roman Catholic priests at Boston,Massachusetts.It stars a talented ensemble of actors and actresses in Mark Ruffalo,Michael Keaton,Rachel McAdams,Liev Schreiber,John Slattery,Brian d'Arcy James and Stanley Tucci. It was based on a series of stories by the said team that enabled the newspaper to win the Pulitzer Prize back in 2003. What makes the film is great is numerous.First,we get to see great performances from its ensemble cast.They portrayed the real-life characters sincerely and accurately.The film did not fall into the trap of trying to maximize the good qualities nor magnify their achievements as well as the hard work they put forth into the newspaper unit.Second,the subject of investigation wasn't really an abomination of the Catholic Church as other films with similar themes do portray.It only reflected the priests who were assigned at Boston.Third,it provides the viewer of what a newspaper should be all about in reporting news and doing investigation like the "Spotlight" team.It was obviously not created to sensationalize topics they are investigating for better profit reports but rather for moral urgency and their responsibility to report the truth to the reading public.It also tried to stay away from what most newspapers have become these days and how the team remained true to their identity.In summary,this would make us appreciate them better and it gives investigative journalists a good name.Touching and very emotional! 6/10 Review: Although I found the subject matter touching and pretty upsetting at times, and all of the actors put in a great performance, from an entertainment point of view, it seemed more like a documentary than a cinematic extravaganza, and I really wanted to see the priest's get punished for all of there nasty acts. I'm glad that the director used top actors to portray such a touching story, about a group of journalist, who work for the Boston Globe, and go to extreme lengths to undercover the terrible true story about priest who rape young kids. The fact that the important documents were hidden away, was truly disgusting, and the poor victims, who were mostly damaged for life, also touched me. You do have to be in the right mood to watch this film because it is very one toned and it is one of those movies that will leave you feeling angry and pretty emotional. As for the performances, all of the actors gave this delicate subject, there all, and it shows journalist in a different light, by proving that they also can do good without uncovering a scoop, just for profit. Personally, I don't think that it's one of those films that you can watch time and time again but it's still a well made movie, which brings an untold story to light. Enjoyable! Round-Up: I'm not sure that this film deserved a Best Picture Academy Award, especially with Mad Max and the Revenant in the same category but you can't fault the film for emotion, and the script is well written. Personally I don't think that it needed to be 2 hours long and I did find some of the scenes repetitive but with that aside, it's still one to watch and it's great to see Keaton back on top form. The movie was directed and written by Tom McCarthy, 49, who also brought you the Station Agent, The Visitor, Win Win and the disappointing, the Cobbler, so this movie was a complete change of directed for the actor/director, who recently starred in Pixels with Adam Sandler. He was brave to make a movie about a subject matter which has been kept under the radar for some time, and I'm sure that there are still people out there that won't accept the truth but I personally think that there was room for Tom to go deeper, from the punishment perspective. Its still a decent film which deserved recognition but I did see better films in 2015/2016. Budget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $88.3million I recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/history/dramas starring Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, Elena Wohl and Brian D'Arcy James. 6/10A pretty solid film that took home an Oscar this year. Spotlight is directed by Tom McCarthney and stars Mark Ruffalo from 13 Going On 30 and Avengers,Rachel McAdams from The Vow,Micheal Keaton from Birdman and Jack Frost,Liev Schreiber from Kate &amp; Leopold,and Stanley Tucci from Maid In Manhattan and tells the tale about a group of journalists who work for a man played by Keaton who uncovers the shocking truth behind the catholic church as a bunch of priests were assaulting innocent people sexually and verbally and The Boston Globe team has to find the innocent people and write an article for this shocking scandal that shook the world. Now I had no intention of seeing this movie as I got the DVD of it a few days ago as I heard that it was a very good movie that won Best Picture at the Oscars this year. Th film feels more like a documentary rather than a film as the whole film consists of Ruffalo,McAdams,Schreiber,and Keaton trying to come up with an article for the Catholic Church and to find as many pedo priests as possible resulting in a shocking amount of priests who have ruined the lives of many people. What I liked about this film was the cast now I always liked Micheal Keaton,Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo as I seen them in A lot of films,Liev Schreiber I only seen him in X Men Orgins Wolverine and Kate &amp; Leopold and I thought Schreiber was hilarious in Kate &amp; Leopold. My only downside to this film is that it feels like it drags on and on and I was surprised there wasn't any scenes where we actually see the priests doing the shocking things that they did to the people many years ago as this film is set in the year 2001 since the scandal occurred,and for a whooping 123 minutes it certainly drags A lot.  But sure I thought it was a pretty good flick,did it deserve to in Best Picture? Well it is a good movie but im sure there were plenty of other films that surpass this one. My overall rating is a 8 and a half out of 10 and 4/5 stars. Very good film if you are into these true stories and you want to find out more on the Catholic Church scandal. I myself am a catholic person and I was shocked at the outcome of it all.Devastating Spotlight focuses on a devastating turn of events which were ripe for melodrama, and instead turns out to be a spare, minimalistic entry that knows how to keep things close to the chest and still be deeply affecting. Director Tom McCarthy takes a fly-on-the-wall approach to his technique, showing us an intimate glimpse at what it no doubt must have been like for these Boston reporters as they brought to light one of the most sickening and heinous atrocities of our time, the sexual abuse scandal of the Catholic Church, which rotted through many a priest, parish and law firm who insidiously kept their mouths shut about the whole deal. For the reporters, ignorance was just not on the table, no matter what the consequences. Rachel McAdams is tender and fearless as Sacha Pfeiffer, a keen operative who is first to smoke out a lead, bringing it to her boss, the legendary Walter 'Robby' Robinson, (Michael Keaton), and the executive in charge of the paper, Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery). The matter is brought to further attention by Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), who arrives from out of state. It's Mike Rezendes though, played by a stunning Mark Ruffalo, who drives the point home, refusing to give up and shoving loads of empathy down the throats of those who would look the other way. Ruffalo is note perfect, his determined sentiment delivered with compassion and impact that lingers. He hounds diamond in the rough lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci hides the sympathy behind the sass) to allow him access to the victims, giving him something concrete to go on. The bitter side of the lawyer coin comes in the form of Eric McLeish (underrated Billy Crudup), a passively belligerent guy who is anything but cooperative until the hammer comes down. Richard Jenkins proves that he can turn in excellent work with nothing but his voice, playing a source who is heard only via phone calls. Keaton is brilliant, bringing the laid back nature and giving the character an easy listening style Boston accent. McAdams mirrors the hurt in those she interviews with eyes that echo years of suffering. Tucci comes the closest the film gets to comic relief, and then veers into dead serious mode as he realizes his character is in control of lives with the info he has, snapping to rigid attention. Watch for work from Jamey Sheridan, Len Cariou, Brian D'Arcy James and Paul Guilfoyle as well. The film arrives at its destination free from obvious emotional fireworks, on screen text or sensationalism, elements which often permeate true life stories. It's simple, to the point, grounded and diligent to story, character and truth. That approach makes it all the more shattering.Definitely in the spotlight I was gutted to have missed this at its original UK release back in January, especially when it received some attention at this year's Academy Awards winning two Oscars, Best Picture and Best Screenplay, and nominated for four others I really wanted to see this. So, a bit of a throwback Thursday I fortunately managed to catch a silver screening at my local.  I knew this film was going to be good but didn't know it was going to be that good. The film is about the Spotlight journalists writing for the Boston Globe at the turn of the millennium, before, and after 9/11. A tight team of thorough investigators that chase controversy and when new editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) takes the helm, he politely, yet assertively tasks the team to do a follow up story on the Catholic child molestation scandal that seems to be swept under the rug.  It's a great portrayal of corruption and how it seeps into everywhere, especially where some can make a gain and how a whole population can turn a blind eye and pretend nothing is happening. It displays social responsibility, honesty, guilt and torment as you follow the paper trail spanning what I think is two years long.  Tom McCarthy directs and does an amazing job of recreating a quiet monster, a battle of office forces that reminded me of Michael Mann's The Insider (1999) and Alan J. Pakula's All The Presidents Men. (1976) I loved McCarthy film, The Visitor (2007) with Richards Jenkins, who I think provides a voice for this film, and McCarthy gives that same gracefulness, realism and subtly in his filmmaking.  It's an incredible cast with Michael Keaton at the lead, who, spent time with the real Walter Robinson and researched him prior to meeting him. Walter Robinson reporting on several occasions that Keaton does a true and scary account of himself; which is a shame for the general audience such as myself because most of us don't know how Walter 'Robby' Robinson behaves so it's difficult to judge Keaton's acting. It's good nonetheless.  You can see why Mark Ruffalo got Oscar nominated for his role as abrasive, passionate and frustrated Mike Rezendes, but I can now also understand why the Oscar went to Mark Rylance for Bridge of Spies. That awkward moment when your first name is called at the awards but it's the other Mark. Still, Ruffalo gives a great performance and deserves all the credit, and pizza.  Not sure about Rachel McAdams; she's does great, don't get me wrong but I didn't think it was worthy of the Oscar nomination unlike Ruffalo's. Tony Stark's Dad, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci play great charismatic parts as does CSI's Paul Guilfoyle and Watchman, Dr. Manhattan Eric Crudup. Liev Schreiber has always been one of my favourite co-stars and he quietly makes his presence known even among all the drama and shouting. He almost sounds like Dustin Hoffman.  The film is a superb testament to good, honest reporting and shows us that truth and power is controlled by the people sitting on high and depends solely on how good and true those people are if something is to be done. The meek will inherit the Earth. I can see fans of Money Ball and The Big Short taking to this film greatly, films about people who take on the system and win, a true 'David and Goliath' of a story.

Spotlight is a team of four in The Boston Globe newspaper working on investigative articles. This leisurely paced movie based on true events set in 2001 has Mark Ruffalo playing Mike Rezendes (the real Mike was present in Oscars ceremony) along with Michael Keaton as editor of Spotlight and Rachel McAdams and two others as members of Spotlight. When new editor Marty Baron played Liev Schreiber asks the Spotlight team to work on the left over case of Priest Geoghan case which is investigating a church cover-up of child abuse by Catholic priests. Spotlight team piece together the missing pieces, which turn out to be a global case which takes them against Cardinal law of the church. Director Tom McCarthy who wrote along with Josh Singer has given impeccable work in writing the screenplay with powerful dialogues aided by adequate cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi. This movie is recommended for serious movie lovers only.requiem for true journalism Director Tom McCarthy authored a very interesting first film in 2003 (The Station Agent) and then his career seemed to go adrift into 'OK movies'. Now he hits gold with Spotlight which does not differ much in directing style from his other films, but just gathers a number of very favorable factors into proving that you can get a Best Film Academy Award even taking the 'OK approach' (in a 'dry' year as 2015 was). Let me start with the positive things, and there are many of these. One first condition to hit gold at the Academy Awards is to run one of those big American stories, that play well with the concepts and heroes of the nation. Investigative journalism and people who make the news are the main theme and the heroes of the film, and on this respect 'Spotlight' follows a tradition that starts with 'Citizen Kane' and continues with films like All President's Men and Zodiac. The story that is investigated by the 'Boston Globe' 'Spotlight' team in the movie is the sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests and the cover-up of the phenomenon and of its dimensions by the Church institutions but also by the town authorities, judicial system, community leaders. It's an explosive subject which to some extent continues until today. The 'based on real events' factor works well here because we know that the implications and ramifications of the problem continue until today. The writers and producers of this film chose to use the real names and tried to remake the true story as close as possible to the facts, places, characters. The other strong attribute of this film is the accurate rendition of the 'yesterday' atmosphere to the smallest detail. The story happens between 2000 and 2002, this was so close and yet so far from many points of view. Acting is also very precise, although the homogeneity of the team makes the characters indistinguishable from a moral stand point of view. It's like I missed an element of hesitation, of fear of consequences - the story looks not like what it happened but like the way the heroes told the world it happened. Sure, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, and Liev Schreiber do all fine jobs, and I also liked how many of the supporting actors entered into their smaller parts. I do not believe however that 'Spotlight' would have won the Best Film Award in another year. It lacks the sparkle that make the big movies we remember over the years. It may also be the last important movie in his genre. As printed journalism melts down and the multi-channel TV news and the Internet take over, the public relies less and less on this kind of journalism. People have easy access to much more information, they can change easily allegiance to any channel of news on TV or Internet, they need to make the choices by themselves. 'Spotlight' may be the cinematographic requiem for the kind of journalism it describes.Well Executed Spotlight Movie Marathon V.3 # 070 Spotlight is well made movie based on the true incidents happened / happening all over the world within the Christian Community. This picks a daring story of sexual molestation on Kids which involves the priests from lower ranks to the higher ones.  Excellent Screenplay and dialogues Executed in a much different way. You don't even get bored in this investigative thriller even for one second. The amazing performances by the lead actors especially Michael Keaton (WoW, he is too good), Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams and Brian. Liev Schrieber and other actors did wonderful jobs as the supporting actors. The camera-work was pretty much good reprising the 90s. The major ups of this movie as i earlier said was the story and performances which made this movie so lively and interesting to watch. I couldn't see any actors in this movie and all i saw was some reporters investigating on some meaty news. If you are interested in a well executed thriller with more good moments.  Don't even hesitate to watch this.. This will fill your mind for sure. My rating 8.5 on 10Watch it once I didn't catch Spotlight when it was originally released, but caught it when it was playing after receiving the best picture Oscar. The film tells the story of the Boston Globe investigation into sexual abuse by members of the catholic church. It therefore belongs very much in the category of movies you have to see rather than you want to see. As is common with a lot of cases of this nature the perpetrators escape justice. The Boston Globe have to try and expose exactly what is going on. The script and acting are exceptional. the film undoubtedly leaves a lasting impression. In common with Schindlers List Spotlight is a film that I am glad that I watched, but have no intention of watching again.We the people The only reason my rating of this film isn't the maximum ten stars is that it presents a Jewish guy as a white knight leading Christians in a crusade against themselves. The problem actually is two systems, one being the hypocrisy of the Roman Catholic Church hiding hedonism beneath its claim to celibacy, and the other being the hypocrisy of our mass media hiding other hypocrisy when revealing it doesn't sell advertising. Note that the anchors of CNN's show The Lead and MSNBC's show Meet the Press and Fox News' show Media Buzz are all Jewish, and that those are 100 percent of the top three television shows focusing on mass media, while noting that less than a quarter of a percent of humanity is Jewish. And, actually, Saul of Tarsus was a Pharisee who perverted Jesus' message and some of his disciples into fitting his pharisaical sect. And that's also part of the how mass media sell the masses the terrorist lie that ISIS is Islamic. HITRTA fine but "unnessesary" movie Did not expect this movie to be this popular. Still don't really see why. "Was it interesting?" The subject matter was well handled. The dialog was fine. I really enjoyed the legal manoeuvrings and the extent of the conspiracy. 2 out of 3. "Was it memorable?" The performances were fine, but nothing amazing. The cinematography was rather good in parts but didn't hold up overall. My biggest problem was the reason this movie was made. This could have been a strait documentary, especially with unknown actors. Using known actors distracts from the story. 1.5 out of 3. "Was it entertaining?" I did not care for the end reveal. They did portray research and interviewing as not being mind-dulling work. 1 out of 3. Starting with 1 (because the evidence says so), 1 + 2 + 1.5 + 1 = 5.5 I'm going to round down to 5 for only giving some of the characters incomplete back-stories.Something was not quite right The story is fantastic and the people that were involved in it needed to be recognized or revealed, depending on which side they were on, but something was a bit off about the movie. The performances were great as well, so the only thing that remains is the direction. It was a good movie, don't get me wrong, but it felt bland most of the time, yet peppered with some mildly irritating moments that pumped the dramatic. You know, children appearing in the shot randomly and long shots on the frowns of the reporters, heroic overtime working and watching the morning edition leaving in the trucks in the night and so on and so on. One other thing that bothered me was that John Slattery was cast in the role of a red herring, but otherwise minor. I like the guy, he deserves good meaty roles! Bottom line: I liked The Big Short a lot more. I can't tell you exactly why, since both movies are using the same kind of recipe: ordinary people investigating something unbelievable, but true, the old "get an Oscar" formula, yet I liked only one of them. It was the mood, perhaps, or the dynamism. Anyway, I think there are so many other movies that deserved an Oscar more than this one.99% engaging .1 % punch mission I must say this is one of the most realistic movie i have seen in recent past.After watching this movie i hope everyone appreciate the work by the journalists in exposing the hidden truths of our society. All the characters are perfect.Mark Ruffalo's mannerism and facial expressions creates an aura of authenticity. Michael Keaton's character evolves with the film and compels you to think about your own inner thoughts. This movie will inspire everyone to live up to their professional ethics.I can say that one of the best cinematic depiction of investigative journalism. Character of Shasha who struggle with her professional and personal beliefs are some of the finest moments in the whole movie.Uncovering the sins committed by whom the millions of people believe in. A documentary film would show the real faces of those offenders to shame them. That's the reason I desperately wanted it to be a documentary, then I would have definitely given a maximum mark. There's no complaint about this movie, but adaptation means fakes acting, fake settings and awards goes to non real achievers. Anyway, this movie kind looked a semi documentary and liked the way it was made. The movie exposed a very important scandal. If something is open for a debate in the US means, the rest of the world would follow the same route. That's where this theme was inspired by. It all begins with a group of journalists from the Boston Globe with their new editor instruct them to research on sexual abuse of children by priests. So their lead only gets bigger and puts them to recover more evidence in order to publish. How they come up with the story that shake up not only the nation, but the entire world is the remaining. A collection of bunch fine performances. There's no lead actors in this. Everyone is in the supporting roles. Out of 6, it got nominated both male and female in the category of supporting role for the Academy Awards. I am very disappointed, Mark Ruffalo's performance in 'Infinitely Polar Bear' deserved another nominee. Anyway, this 15 year old story still looks a hot topic. It was a great comeback for the director after critics assaulted him with their words for his previous film 'The Cobbler' only to show their rage on Sandler. It is a must-must see. Beware, is is not your weekend entertainer, but based on the real. 8/10Captivating true story This was a very revealing and informative movie, a much needed exposure of the Catholic church and certain pedophile priests. We are used to seeing movies about sexually abused girls and are aware of their plight, however this is the first movie I've seen that addresses the issue of sexually abused boys. How many boys are being abused in this way around the world and no one speaks up for them! This movie also shows that it's never too late to do what's right, even if you didn't do it before when you first had the opportunity. It's amazing to discover the whereabouts of Cardinal Bernie Law now. As for the acting, it was superb. Even though there was a lot of dialogue, I was kept captivated by the story and its unraveling until the very end.One of the best real life incident based movie in last ten years One of the best movie of the year no doubt , the way it represented the whole incident is amazing . Hats off to the director and script writer Tom Mccarthy and Josh singer . To me the best male supporting actor academy award should go to the genius Mark Ruffalo . What an actor he is !  Michael Keaton also acted brilliantly as he most of the time does , he is a God gifted talent and Rachael McAdams and Liev Schreiber also did their respective characters quite well but to me this is the film of two persons first of course is Mark Ruffalo and second is Tom Mccarthy . I hope it will get the best movie award too along with original screen play . All the best for the movie for the academy award .Appropriate recount of a societal cancer, though not a monumental movie It has the full merit of showing a reconstruction of the investigative process that went into finding out about the squalid trail of abuse and corruption perpetrated under the untouchable umbrella of the Catholic Church – spit – and making it all public despite the institutional omertà (you gotta pronounce it with the accent, people; it sounds like the Spanish "Que Sera") and all-consuming 9/11/01 terrorist attacks. Ruffalo is the one that comes through in this, since he's both an elastic actor and a real-life passionate activist; the movie itself isn't memorable or particularly gripping, cast notwithstanding, sticking as it does to procedural moves and case filing. At least, though, it doesn't pimp the story with the usual crass affectation like in "The Big Short", an otherwise timely tale of power and destruction. If not for a straight-to-DVD movie titled "Milquetoast", I don't know why they keep giving roles to Rachel McAda... zzzzzThe Vidiot Reviews... Spotlight The Catholic Church opposes abortion because they need more children to molest. Fortunately, the journalists in this drama are putting a stop to the latter. When Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), the new editor of the Boston Globe's investigative department, gets wind of a lawyer's (Stanley Tucci) claim that the Archbishop hide allegations of sexual abuse, he directs his team (Michael Keaton Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams) to focus solely on this story. Their findings unearth dozens of victims still waiting for justice, an archdiocese simply relocating the accused, and negligence on the paper's part for not publishing tips it had received years prior. The unfortunate true story that shook Boston to its core in 2002, Spotlight's ensemble cast shines as a beacon of excellence equal to the journalists they portray, while the script is detailed but not exploitive. However, the Catholic Church exacted its revenge when the Internet destroyed newspaper subscriptions.  Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.caStory avoids the spike by a gnats whisker Similar in story arc to Philomena, this presentation, though dealing with an equally huge impact story, manages to keep characterisatons Izal thin. Mark Ruffalo is the most compelling in his role adding urgency and doggedness to what might otherwise come across as a flat, even tempered tale. Some mumbling dialogue doesn't help either but these are nit-picking criticisms for a brave effort to progress the exposure of historic and ongoing child abuse originating within the Catholic priesthood. There's enough to keep your attention throughout and you won't regret see this film but you might just still have some questions. Good as far as it goes....I'm sure there could be a sequel.Loved it and this is why Above being a superb movie, it's a very necessary movie. The story needed to be broadcast to the word and there was no better way to do so than this. This movie had me from the begining. Cinematography didn't really bring anything new and exciting but it definitely wasn't a fluke. Direction was great but the overall biggest and most compelling aspect as the acting. This movie had them all. Micheal Keaton and Mark Rufallo's performances gave me chills. They made me believe that they were the ones actually reporting on this story. I'm glad this movie was brought to the screen, not only as an outstanding movie, but as a testament against time that the good in people will prevail when the evil in people try to hide the truth. It deserved best picture for sure. 8.9 out of 10 stars! What a great movie.If you love a great crime investigation, this is for you! I really loved this movie! Great actors that did an amazing job, fascinating plot that really drives you in and get you invested, it's beautifully shot and really gives the movie its feel. So if you're a sucker for unsolved crimes and unlikely villains this is absolutely not going to disappoint and definitely worth the watch!It will leave you shaken.... Before you consider watching "Spotlight", I STRONGLY urge you to think twice. It isn't because I think it's a bad film--it's amazingly good. But it's also a difficult film to watch--particularly if you or someone close to you has been a victim of sexual abuse. I know that in my case, it was particularly tough because I am a retired psychotherapist and used to specialize in working with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators...the latter, which, I think benefit very little from treatment (which is much of the reasons I changed careers). The story is about not only the discovery of a huge number of pedophile priests in the Boston parish by Boston Globe reporters but the organization's discovery that the problem went all the way to the top. In other words, even the beloved Cardinal Bernard Law KNEW about the many, many victims and yet did nothing to discipline them or restrict their access to more victims. But the film doesn't just talk about so much that we know to be true today but it covers the stop by step process by which the paper began and completed the investigation. Why did I give the film a 10...particularly since I almost never give films such high scores? Well, the reason is that the folks making the movie really, really cared about the subject matter and getting it right. Instead of focusing on making money with the film and including the usual glitz and glamour, the filmmakers chose instead to emphasize realism above all else. Normal looking actors (such as Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo) are used...and they make efforts to keep them normal looking. Additionally, the film has a relatively slow and deliberate pace--again as they weren't interested in making a pretty or Hollywoodizing the production. Overall, a great film made greater because the folks making it really, really seemed to care and wanted to get it right...which showed great sensitivity for the subject matter and the victims. Great film!Excellent Story and Performances Spotlight (2015)  **** (out of 4)  Excellent movie based around the Boston Globe's investigation into various accounts of sexual abuse that was hidden by the Catholic Church. Obviously, SPOTLIGHT doesn't deal with a fun subject but the film is the perfect example of how to make a great movie. Take a great director and give him a great script to work with. Then you get a great cast to deliver great performances and bring those lines of dialogue and story to life. Why aren't more movies made like this? I'm going to guess it's because these types of films aren't going to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office but if you're a fan of cinema then SPOTLIGHT offers a whole lot. The subject matter itself is something that will make you blood boil but director Tom McCarthy handles it in a very classy way. The screenplay is so great because it really comes across as a blueprint on how journalism should work and obviously while watching the film you're going to think back to movies like THE FRONT PAGE and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. The story here is one that certainly grabs your attention and McCarthy does an excellent job at building up the tension as the reporters race against a clock but also race to find more victims to try and build case. Again, the subject matter isn't pretty but the film perfectly blends the drama of the victim's story as well as the drama and moral clause that people like reporters have. It certainly doesn't hurt that we're given an excellent cast that bring the material to life. Michael Keaton turns in another wonderful performance as the main guy who maybe connected to the crimes. Liev Schreiber has never been better than he is here as the man who pushes for the investigation. Then you have a tender performance from Rachel McAdams as well as Stanley Tucci delivering his finest work in years. With that said, Mark Ruffalo steals the film with his remarkable performance as the main reporter trying to bust the creeps who hid the crimes. The emotion, rage and power in his performance jumps right off the screen. SPOTLIGHT is technically quite flawless as the cinematography, the score, editing and every other aspect are terrific. Of course, a movie like this works on an intelligent level because it asks questions to the viewer and doesn't always just spell out the answer. The movie manages to be highly entertaining from start to finish and it really packs a punch without having to resort to preaching.It did not bother me at all... So I have to admit I ended watching the movie after about 45 minutes because it just did not interest me at all. I am from Germany and yes I have heard something about child abuse by church but why should I really be interested in a local (Boston) child abuse scandal which a local newspaper is reporting about? I think this is a good example why not every problem or event makes good stuff for a movie. I was impressed on how many great actors are in the movie and about how little they were able to show in those 45 minutes. So I just found it totally uninteresting and I had problems to even understand those many persons and their part in the movie.Masterpiece That's the most impressive drama I've watched nowadays. Gradually increasing tension keeps you under pressure almost all the time. There are no words to describe the role play of the actors especially Mark Ruffalo who is logically nominated for best supporting role from the academy. Great job for the screenplay as well! Those kind of problems directly linked to the catholic church, media, court and other public institutions are very existential these days. And there is the thin moment , the movie doesn't offense only one part of system, but exactly the opposite! It shows that every part of it has rotten apples and in the same time people with moral values.Spotlight: A new high for journalism As I'm writing this review, Spotlight has already won two academy awards this year including an Oscar for the Best Picture. Although released in November 2015 but in India it is releasing this week. In this era of sensational journalism Spotlight emerges as a ray of fresh light. The movie boasts an ensemble of great cast that includes Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schrieber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci. The movie opens with a short 1976 Police station scene and quickly jumps to 2001 into the office of The Boston Globe. The newspaper hires a new editor Baron (Liev Schrieber downplaying with finesse, whom many Indians remember as the person who presented Oscar with Priyanka). After reading a news piece about a lawyer Mitchell Garabedian, who says that Cardinal Bernard Law (the Archbishop of Boston) knew that the priest John Geoghan was sexually abusing children and did nothing to stop him, Baron asks the Spotlight team (which takes months in researching a case) to follow this case. Walter "Robby" Robinson (Michael Keaton) leads the team and is very convincing in his portrayal of a leading from the front boss. He assigns Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo will make you forget Hulk) to pursue Garabedian (Stanley Tucci), a very busy and reluctant to help lawyer. Ruffalo plays an adamant, sensitive and impeccably observant reporter. Rachel McAdams plays Sasha pfeiffer who along with Eric MacLeish played by a theater actor Brian d'Arcy James go door to door asking uncomfortable questions. Spotlight shows what true journalism is all about. It's about following a story with sheer honesty and utter conviction. Everybody follows a different path and researches the case in their own manner and slowly and steadily pieces start falling in place. It's about even going against the mighty Church which may potentially endanger the future prospects of a newspaper. We live in a time where newspapers are filled with news of child abuse all around the country. Spotlight goes on to show that this isn't a local phenomenon but a global one and even an authority as high as Church can also get involved. There is a scene in the movie where Sasha interviews a Father and he accepts molesting children and sees nothing wrong in it and in fact terms it as fooling around with boys. This gets you thinking how safe are we with such ignorant god man around. It was high time a movie on Journalism made and Spotlight not just ticks this box but with the help of great acting and crisp screenplay delivers a beautiful movie. I'm going with 4 stars out of 5 for spotlight. A new high for Journalism. This review is also available on http://www.wibble.in/2016/03/lights-camera-spotlight/ by the same authorA Masterpiece!! Aside from the subject matter I think this movie is an example of the best the industry has to offer. To call Spotlight a docudrama would be a disservice. The script, direction and the ensemble cast made me feel like a voyeur, a fly on the wall watching these people work. Immediately I was lost in the story. I loose sight of these people as actors and for two hours I'm transported to Boston, the Globe offices and the meeting rooms and living rooms where the story develops. Much like viewing painting or listening a musical masterpiece I can (and do) watch this movie over and over.Remarkable! One of the best films, if not THE best, that I have seen based on a true story. The acting is great and the directing as well. The spectator soon realises that its intention is not to tell half the story, but the full deal! I was amazed by the persistence of the reporters of the Boston Globe in uncovering a huge case of child molestation by people who are supposedly conveying the word of God to people of faith. It's a must see for anyone involved in the profession of journalism, just to learn how their job should be done. Congratulations to everyone involved in the making of it and I surely hope that it will be rewarded by critics.This film is a one trick pony When I saw this film I dismissed it as another film trying to capture attention by poking the embers of something thought of as being a sacred fire. It really sheds little light on how to deal with the subject and just seems to cash in on the furor over child molestation. It certain does not present the 'other side' or much useful information, other than this is not at all acceptable. Priest bashing had been going on for a dozen years and all this film does is stir the embers. I thought the subject was over with the Jerry Sandusky episode, but I guess not. I saw no new territory covered and would suggest everyone skip it. Now that it just won the academy award, it might be viewed to see if it was worthy of the award. Worth of being made into a film yes, but worthy of the best film of the year status no.An Almost-There Case Study Spotlight deals with an incredibly important and recent current event-- the Boston Globe's uncovering of the Catholic priest sex scandal. Throughout the film the characters uncover layers of conspiracy, as well as new twists in the story, and deal with the inherent corruption and guilt in Boston's "small town" atmosphere in that the institutions and people seem to protect each other for the sake of community. However, none of these plot twists come to full fruition, and the film didn't seem to be able to choose any single theme, instead vying to take on too many. A good deal of the middle acts are spent with a moral struggle over what story to publish-- whether to quickly publish attacks at specific offenders, or wait to find the story about corruption at the highest levels of the church-- and also the struggle of dealing with guilt over having buried the story years before. However, these struggles are both brushed off or faded out with simple dialogue resolutions in single scenes. Additionally, early on in the film, the script takes a strong start in dealing with the pain felt by the victims, and humanizing and individualizing them; however, after a few scenes of dealing with the victims, the film pats itself on the back for a job well done and moves on from them altogether. The ensemble cast had fair performances across the board; Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams seemed altogether understated, and Mark Ruffalo felt more like a young actor experimenting with stylized performance than the seasoned and ranged film veteran that he is. That being said, the script succeeds in keeping the viewer's attention throughout the film, and managed to do some justice to the importance of the story and the difficult job that investigative journalists hold. The film was also visually pleasing; there was nothing groundbreaking or breathtaking about the cinematography or mise-én-scene, but the muted colors and well- composed shots made for an accessible and easy to watch experience.Breathtaking experience This movie is that type of movie you'll never forget, moreover you're gonna talk about it, spread the word around and ask others around you to watch it so you can discuss it with them later on. Big credit to whole team that did not hesitate to make/produce/work on this film. Everyone who saw it must admit this is one of the most sensitive theme around for a few years.  In my opinion, this was the best acting by Mark Ruffalo so far, his accent, his moves, his speech, everything was top notch. Big credits goes to Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams and last but not least Liev Shreiber who wasn't on screen that much, however he still made a huge impact on whole story in many ways - he was like a shark, silent killer. I can't express enough how important this movie is, how it can change the look on those who were abused, how it can and hopefully will change the life of those who were molested, their families, friends... You got to watch this, it's nearly a masterpiece.Utterly compelling drama from Tom McCarthy Patience is key in the world of investigative journalism, a fact highlighted in Spotlight, the brilliant biographical drama from director Tom McCarthy. The same man who brought us The Cobbler last year has certainly made major amends with this compelling drama that tells the true story of the revelation that shook the Catholic Church to its core. When Marty Baron (Live Schreiber) was hired as the new editor of The Boston Globe in 2001, he discovered the Spotlight Team, headed by Walter "Robby" Robinson (Michael Keaton), a small group of investigative journalists who can take up to a year to publish a story, consisting of Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) and Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery). After reading a column about a local Boston priest who was sexually abusing children and the Archbishop of Boston, who chose to ignore these crimes, Baron urges the Spotlight Team to investigate the story. Initially thinking they are investigating a one-off case, the team soon uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Roman Catholic priests in Massachusetts, and the ongoing cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese.  Having spent a semester at university studying investigative journalism, I absolutely loved how Tom McCarthy told the story of this team of reporters who slowly start to uncover the horrific truth buried beneath the Catholic Church, piece by piece. McCarthy's film, co-written by Josh Singer, doesn't hold back when it comes to its sensitive subject matter; a story we may not want to hear but one that needed to be heard. The shock of the revelations are really felt through the screenplay and the character journeys we see throughout, particularly that of Rezendes. I was left shaking my head at some of the truths revealed about the local Boston priests however, I was left open-mouthed at the facts that closed the film. I just could not believe the sheer scale of what had been uncovered. Coming to the performances, Spotlight really does boast one hell of an impressive ensemble cast. Each of them work well with the screenplay from McCarthy and Singer, delivering good performances however, Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton are the ones that really excel in Spotlight. Ruffalo picks up yet another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and is probably the main challenge to Sylvester Stallone, while Rachel McAdams really does earn her maiden Academy Award nomination in the role of Sacha Pfeiffer. The score from Howard Shore impressed me as well. I really felt Shore captured the disturbing side of the investigation while also managing to emphasise the determined work ethic of the Spotlight Team. There's also an eerily brilliant use of the song Silent Night towards the end that deserves a mention. It may not possess the cinematography of The Revenant or the heart of Creed however, Spotlight is an equally powerful and important film that has to be seen. I really do hope it walks away with the Academy Award for Best Picture come the end of this month.4 Journalists uncover the maybe darkest secret of the Chatolic Church. I was deeply affected after watching Tom McCarthy's based-on-a-true-story movie 'Spotlight'. After I left the cinema hall in my town I felt some kind of unease inside me. This feeling was provoked not only by the fact that the movie is based on a terrifying true story but also by how the actors accomplished to bring this story to life with ravishing performances from Mark Ruffalo (Mike Rezendes), Michael Keaton (Walter 'Robby' Robinson), Rachel McAdams (Sacha Pfeiffer) and Brian d'Arcy James (Matt Carroll). 'Spotlight' follows the story of an investigation, conducted by the team 'Spotlight', working for the daily newspaper - Boston Globe. The team of 4 investigating journalists brings to light a 30-year-old secret that has its roots deeply in the Chatolic Church hierarchy. A story, about child molestation, which nobody can be indifferent to. Most of the molested back then kids - 30 years later with kids of their own, had been through many obstacles due to the ghastly immoral act. Some of them had taken the path of the syringe and drugs. Others had gone crazy and schizophrenic and the other part had killed themselves due to maybe the embarrassment they had to live with for the rest of their lives afterward. Most of the kids, who were molested would not talk about the act, because they were in some way petted by the priests and were too scared and too abashed to talk with somebody about this. Tom McCarthy's 'Spotlight' shows us the importance of the investigating journalist's work and also that they have the power to unfold great mysteries to the public no matter how dark and horrifying the mysteries are.Best Movie Spotlight is one of the best movie I have ever watched. All the characters played by the actors are awesome. It feels like you are not watching a movie, but it's happening around you.  Mark Ruffalo is a superstar. He has very good acting skills. No doubt everybody has given their 100%. So realistic, I must say everybody must watch this movie before they die. Sudden changes in journalists life after joining of new editor. Handled such a delicate subject in a very good way. And finally truth wins over."On the Side of the Angels" In the DVD version of "Spotlight," there is a fascinating bonus segment where we meet the actual Boston Globe reporters whose groundbreaking story of pedophilia within the Catholic church is the subject of this film. It is not only interesting to learn more about these journalists, but also to hear their own accounts of their research into the case. At the close of the bonus clip, one of the reporters relates that he felt that their efforts were "on the side of the angels" in raising awareness and bringing the truth to light for so many of the victims. As a film, "Spotlight" is comparable to the journalistic thriller "All the President's Men," which tells the backstory of the two famous Washington Post reporters, Woodward and Bernstein, who broke the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. One of the strengths of "Spotlight" is how the characters of the reporters are individualized. From Liev Shreiber's mild-mannered, soft-spoken editor to Mark Ruffalo's driven, hyperkinetic reporter to Rachel McAdams's thoughtful, intelligent character to Michael Keaton's quirky head of the Spotlight group, the characters were fully realized. It is especially Keaton's role of Robby Robinson that is integral to one of the film's most successful subplots: the incompetence and myopic work of the Boston Globe staff itself for failing to report the story when they essentially had all of the evidence in their possession for years. Without giving away the ending, it is Keaton's character who holds the key to this important strand of the film that deals with journalistic integrity. For acting, directing, and screen writing, "Spotlight" is a remarkable collaborative effort. In viewing this film, one can only wonder how many other untold investigative stories never found their way to the light of the public. In one of the bonus segments, the film's director points out how journalism today is turning news into entertainment and that are not even reporters covering state legislatures today. The film focuses on the importance of journalism at the local level, which led to the successful efforts of the Boston Globe that discovered both the enormity of the child abuse cases, but the scope of the cover-up.  This was an extremely thoughtful and provocative film that is deserving of the recognition it has received. This film truly merits its place in the spotlight.Excellent and Exciting Film in the Tradition of "All the President's Men" "Spotlight" is the "All the President's Men" of a new movie generation. Establishing a journalistic tone that matches the film's setting, it tells the story of a Boston newspaper team's efforts to expose the sexual abuse running rampant throughout the Catholic Church. It's a film with hardly a misstep or false note. Eschewing the histrionics and emotional manipulation that other films would have brought to the same material, "Spotlight" understands that the screenplay and actors hired to interpret it are strong enough without any emotional embellishment, and the film is far more powerful because of the understated approach. The entire cast is at top form, with Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, and John Slattery as the standouts (Ruffalo in particular delivers an impassioned soliloquy so emotionally powerful that it nearly brought me to tears), but this is an ensemble film with actors working together like a well-oiled machine, and it seems unfair to single out any one when they're all so good. Director Tom McCarthy is most known for his work to date on the Pixar movies, and you couldn't find a movie further away from the colorful palettes and winsome stories of the Pixar world. But he proves himself a versatile filmmaker, one who knows how to handle extremely varied material. It would be easy to discount the direction of this film, but one should not underestimate how difficult directing a film that consists almost entirely of conversations would be. And when one also considers that part of good directing is getting good performances from actors, McCarthy's goes down as some of the best directing of the year. So far, this and "Mad Max: Fury Road" are my two favorite movies of the year. How's that for opposite sides of the movie spectrum? Grade: A+It was the Phoenix and not the Globe that broke this story The truth is that it's a well-known fact that Kristen Lombardi of the Boston Phoenix broke this story long before the cowardly editors at the Boston Globe finally ran their version. She, Lombardi, and the Phoenix did the dirty work and the Globe took the credit and is still taking the credit. The rumor, at the time, was that the Globe was bullied by the church into denying that any of the stories published by the Phoenix were true. The Globe became complicit in helping the church keep the story as quiet as possible. This movie is based on a gross misrepresentation of the facts and is being sold on television shows like 'Charlie Rose' as a monument to the Globe's courage and capability in investigative journalism. Read for yourself: http://www.bostonphoenix.com/pages/cardinal.htmnever been so disappointed since the dog picture I've never been so disappointed since they picked that silent movie starring a dog for best picture. Even clown posse fans could pick a better movie. Take away the subject matter. Make it a story about the housing collapse and this movie would have tanked at the box office and shoved away like the detritus it is. It's incredibly banal and uninteresting. Great cast who in every scene seem to be raising their hand like "i've got something", "i've got something". On top of that it's an incredible rewrite of the facts. Google it yourself. It was well known long before this that some priests, everywhere, were abusing kids and the church knew about it. The only thing that came out of this investigation was the fact that this one particular diocese had an official policy of covering up the issue. There's no watergate story here. Besides the misrepresentation, there's no movie here. The acting is bland, bland, bland, details hard to follow and no suspense, or conclusion. Like a long out joke with a confusing punchline.I'd give it half a star if I could - Terrible movie Don't do it, you have been warned. I watched Spotlight and Revenant in 2 weeks. Wasted 5 hours and $30, I should have just stuck needles into my eyes for those 5hours it would have been less painful...just. I don't know what I was thinking, glutton for punishment. Worst move of 2015 Revenant to second worst movie of 2015 Spotlight.  Note to self:do not listen to professional critics, trust your gut instinct. You always have to wander out of the comfort zone...stick to your local films and foreign language films.  I shake my head in wonder at how this movie managed to get an Oscar. There is very little truth to the story, another paper had broken the story earlier and also it was already well known by the time the Globe jumped on board.  It was like watching a news segment that lasts 2 hours. I'll watch Fox News for two hours if I want my news fiddled with and most likely end up with the same feeling of regret. At least it would be free. The actors did not gel in my opinion, there were some fine actors in the ensemble but something just didn't click.By the numbers I can't remember a movie that's SO by-the-numbers as this movie was. I don't get the Oscar win. Everyone has that movie that everybody loves but you just HATE. This is mine I guess. Think investigative reporter- movie and chances are you'll think of something more exciting than this. I thought The Revenant was boring too but that's a trimming issue. It had some very memorable cinematic scenes I can still remember. Spotlight feels like a Law and Order episode. Ugh..I'm out.Good movie This is a good movie telling the truth...but actually the time and chronology of multiple real events make it, ANTI-ANTI-ANTI-INSIDE JOB OF 9/11 fact. :D Shifting the blame hideously and in a whispering way towards the church. It can fool people. It has fooled generations. It has fooled whole of history readers. The script and videography is similar to many middle east movie seen or made. But it is appreciable that such intelligence exists. But beyond that, only few people can catch it. the seed they are tring to plant... anti-anti-anti-insidejob fact.It is a good movie. It won an Oscar.It earned an Oscar. It was given an Oscar for reasons beyond history or our generation.Strong Subject - Good direction - but no story whatsoever ! The only thing strong about the movie was its subject, and that perhaps got people to the theater, other than that a drag, with absolutely no story line. The acting was OK, but actors had little margin to show any acting skill. Its hard to understand what did the investigation team did ? They went through some old documents and talked to a couple of lawyers. Thats not enough for a story line.  There is nothing extra ordinary that the so called spotlight team did - things just came to them - and they didn't do earlier anything for 20 years and finally published a report.  In case its an advertisement for the Boston Globe, its a bad one. The worst part is that its an important subject and needed a better effort than this.
"The Big Short" is educational, relevant and entertaining. Nothing Small about "The Big Short" "The Big Short" is based on the book with the same name by financial journalist Michael Lewis. It is about collateralized debt obligations, subprime mortgages, credit default swaps and bundling. A snoozer right? Not one bit. "The Big Short" is more entertaining than most films in the cineplex this holiday season. Even if you don't know much about the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-08, you will recognize a quality film and want to know more about the world economic collapse when the film is over.  The film uses a multitude of techniques to tell the story. There are fourth-wall breaking monologues, a model in a bubble bath explaining economics as well as a singing idol and a celebrity chef using metaphors of cooking and gambling to explain the economic crisis. There are jump cuts, slow motion, foreshadowing and flash backs. The filmmakers use any and all tricks to explain a complicated mess of financial chicanery in order to help the audience understand. The banks, mortgage brokers, the credit ratings agencies and the government manipulated people in the nation and world into investing in worthless packages of bonds, and it behooves the director and writer, Adam McKay, to use all cinematic tricks to explain and untangle the financial corruption. The miracle is that the film deciphers the economic melt-down well while entertaining its audience.  The acting is stellar from the stars to the bit players. They aren't just playing a role, they embody characters during a remarkable time in history. My mother thinks Steve Carrell was the best actor in the film, for she did not even recognize him at first. He plays against character and she liked that. However, my mother had never seen Carrell in "The Office." His character, Mark Baum, is much like the boss from that television series. However, in "The Big Short", he plays it straight. He is a boss of a fund under the umbrella of Morgan Stanley (but it's not Morgan Stanley, and his team likes to point out), and he is on a mission to bring down banks, to show them up, and to prove he's been right about the financial warning signs. He is betting against the hand that feeds him, Morgan Stanley. I preferred Christian Bale's performance as Michael Burry, an unselfconscious, manic math genius. I haven't seen that frightening look in Bale's eyes since "American Psycho", but this time he's only killing the mortgage backed securities market. Meanwhile, Brad Pitt, under- playing another disaffected former banker, Brad Rickert, helps two friends make millions while they bet against terrible investments, or "play short" the mortgage market. His backstory is revealed steadily and in a way that makes us wonder why he briefly got back into the investment "game." Even Ryan Gosling makes his mark in this star-studded cast playing the prescient "Jared Vennett." Remember, all the characters in the film are based on real people. And that is what makes it so remarkable.  The other major players in the film are Bear Stearns, Morgan Stanley, and a slew of investment houses who at best ignore the coming financial crisis or at worst, colluded in its creation. From the realtors selling the mortgages, to the banks loaning at subprime, to the banks bundling the worthless packages, they were all making too much money to want to stop. This is exactly the kind of over-exuberance that occurred in the 1920s stock market crash, but few payed attention then or in 2007.  "The Big Short" is a dramatized film of true events. And to make sure we understand, the actors break the fourth wall several times to tell us what part is true to the detail and what part is fictionalized to make it more dramatic. But if you are still incredulous, read the book. The events are all sadly true, and we are still paying for it.  Rating: Pay full price (but you might want to see it twice.)  It will take at least two viewings to catch half of what is embedded in this film. This film is entertaining, educational and relevant.  Peace, Tex SheltersAn unexpected and necessary masterpiece Comedy is tragedy + time, right? We're now over 7 years out from the apex of the American financial crisis, which spiraled outward across the world, and yet what has really changed? People are still making millions/billions off the suffering of others, corporate control reigns supreme, fraud is common and remains largely unknown, wealth continues to be ever more concentrated in the grasp of a few, and the remainder of the populace are treated as proverbial rats and made to feel uncouth should they question the system and question not wanting to live their lives playing this sadistic game. Taking 2 pennies and selling them to someone for a hundred dollars remains a legal activity, just call those pennies by a different name and suddenly it's okay to pass them off as fair market. It doesn't sound funny at all, but The Big Short succeeds in turning this demented and corrupt circus into something improbably hilarious and probing. The power of comedy is its ability to let us see something from a different viewpoint, allow us to process it in ways we wouldn't have been able to otherwise. As we might laugh at children for the hilariously unaware things they say and do, so too will humankind in the future hopefully laugh at how completely pathetic and ignorant our present society has been. Martin Scorsese opened the flap up into the circus entrance with "The Wolf of Wall Street" and, while making good points, was perhaps a bit too concerned with his own technique and had a bit too much indulgence, reveling in the frivolity of it all. The Big Short completely blows the top of the circus and dissects it in every way, starting with the widespread fraud and greed in business, and then examining how it has seeped into our entire existences. Even the good guys here are ultimately out there to make money, lots of it. Isn't that what society tells us we must to do, in order to be valuable? It's sick. McKay's approach here is "throw everything in, including the kitchen sink" and that creates an energetic, brilliantly matched representation of the subject matter. This does not mean he is lacking control, however. The story being told includes so many facets and characters that it easily could have fallen into disarray, but McKay makes every single character memorable and illuminates every piece of jargon that could be confusing from the outset. It's a huge accomplishment and a far more important one than might seem apparent. The things that were allowed to happen in the realms of business, finance, and banking are absolutely INSANE and unbelievable. It has to be largely comedic because there's no other way of delivering this vast amount of information and complete failure of our entire society and make it all snap into place so continuously, without being ripped apart by the overwhelming darkness of it all. This isn't simply circumstantial and theoretical and mysterious to a degree, as in Oliver Stone's "JFK", but the cold hard truth. It's not enough to even ask for the truth anymore and ask for answers, we need to question the entire system, a whole web of poisonous bonds that have tightly wound themselves so entirely around us. The work of the film itself is allowing us to project our thoughts, our fears, our anger, and our confusions into this convoluted conundrum. All while being told the truth, so that we at least have a place to even start down the correct path of understanding. It's acting as our own investigative journey in a time when actual news and journalism has become a tiny spec of its former self. We now have more information than ever available to us, yet it's often so shrouded and twisted as to become unrecognizable. There are still those who fear education for what it would do to their own position in life, how it would challenge their own reality. We are still held under the thumb of "greed is good", "thinking you're inherently better is good", "vanity is good". The shiny mainstream hallmarks of a typical Hollywoood commercial product - the agreeable lighting and manicured actors and tidy locations - are so perfectly representative in this film of the emptiness within the characters and indeed in our entire society. After all the progress we think we've made towards world peace and human rights and medical advances and the stability of the human race, have we lost sight of what a fulfilling life and a world of justice should really be? Aren't we still captive to the same pointless rituals and superficialities, doesn't a veritable monarch and royal court still control most everything? We are now living our lives working for something that can be wiped out with the stroke of a keyboard. We are told something of monetary worth that is non-existent, for all intents and purposes, is something we should strive for. Making a bet on the outcome of another bet is a whole industry. The non-existent and ridiculous and pointless directly hurts the lives of many. The Big Short is one of the most important films of this era and one of the best. I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. It is an illumination, a magical pairing of a director's sensibility to exactly the correct form that most fully allows it to blossom and hold water. It is water which the film warns us will be the next basic human necessity to be denied by those few who hold power.The rich get rich and the poor get evicted. Ain't we got Fun Don't know how Adam McKay made deplorable humans, blinding fear, gut-boiling outrage and gleeful shaming so much fun to watch. He brought along his bag o' laffs but planted them in such rich soil so we had to hack our way through the thick underbrush of tainted greenbacks and marked decks. Everyone's in top form. Didn't recognize Brad Pitt for awhile. Ryan Gosling funniest. Christian Bale let us feel his pain and lonely genius. Steve Carell dug deep and came up with a real mensch. Nice to see Marisa Tomei, Hamish Linklater, John Magaro, Rafe Spall, Finn Wittrock, Max Greenfield and talented others working at a solid level. I walked out of the Westwood Bruin Theater in awe and mad as hell.Two-Sided Look at a Great Film First for newbies, the events here took place prior to the Kevin Spacey film Margin Call (2011). So the Spacey film would have depicted events near the end of this film. Both are superb movies. Back to the review. This film is very unusual in that the producers have shown fierce determination in taking a serious topic and making it as user friendly as one possibly can. Multiple techniques are used to this end and they all work well. In fact in places the film has a Monty Python quality. Why was this done? One can only assume that the producers understood the multiple studies showing that the modern city-dweller becomes uncomfortable when confronted with any facts which suggest that he or she was not paying attention when bad things were happening. After all we live in a democracy so the voters should have been more alert? Isn't that their job? The techniques mentioned attempt to appeal to our SESAME STREET side and make the whole thing as pleasant an educational experience as possible. But make no mistake, this is an educational movie. One that should be mandatory for adults. Like getting a driving test before a license. How about learning about Wall Street and the banks before you invest with them...? Carell steals the film and may finally get the attention he deserves. Great actor. Finally the message. The film suggests not only that Wall Street is corrupt but that the corruption extends to the agencies mandated to supervise Wall Street and (possibly) to Washington itself. The implicit message, conveyed in the end credits, that unless we deal with the problem at the source the symptoms will keep happening over and over and over. Duh!Four "outsider" Wall Street entities capitalize on an impending financial collapse of the US financial system. Reviewed by Larry Gleeson. Viewed during the AFI Filmfest 2015. "The Big Short," directed by Adam McKay, based on the book by Michael Lewis, was adapted by McKay and Charles Randolph and made its world premiere Thursday, November 12, 2015 at the historic TCL Grauman's Chinese Theater as the closing night film for the latest edition of the American Film Institute's AFI FEST film festival. The film's narrative is driven by four cynical, fringe Wall Street entities disgusted with the large banking institutions' overriding greed for profits. They make the decision to capitalize on the ensuing housing market calamity and the financial meltdown of 2008 upon discovering the market frenzy is being driven by worthless collateral debt obligations. McKay chooses to inject a significant dose of humor in the early scenes to condition the audience receptors for what they are about to experience. Utilizing the Martin Scorsese docudrama style in a similar setting with "Wolf of Wall Street," a strong narrative voice dominates particular moments. Several of these deliberately break the 'Fourth Wall" in the style of "Wolfie," Jordan Belfort, as the characters, including a hilarious cameo by Selena Gomez, speak directly into the camera to explain the complexities of Wall Street finance. The overall effect adds additional humor and adds another layer in creating a sense of authenticity and truth about the film's subject matter. After a rather lengthy dizzying, yet delightful, character introduction, the film picks up pace as the drama begins to unfold. Dr. Michael Burry, an eccentric financial analyst, with complete autonomy of an investment fund, uncovers variables in his economic forecast indicating a massive housing market collapse. He informs his higher up, Lawrence Fields, played convincingly by Tracy Letts, of his discovery and creates a financial prospectus. In essence, he creates a commodity of selling short on bundled mortgages. The bankers laugh as they willingly sell Burry all the "insurance" he wants. Word quickly spreads of Burry's perceived madness in a after-work cocktail scene. With interest piqued upon overhearing the Wall Street gossip of the day, Jarred Bennett, portrayed by Ryan Gosling, scoops up the essence of Burry's move. Soon, he sells a group led by Steve Carell's all-too-human, Mark Baum to buy in. As the debacle is in full free-fall, Baum struggles with disbelief as he and his group have bet against their own umbrella entity, Morgan Stanley. The final team that has uncovered the impending financial crisis, made up of two Wall Street neophytes and veteran Ben Rickert, played by one of the film's producers, Brad Pitt, also struggles with the imploding financial system caused by corporate greed and indifference. With a mammoth cast, McKay draws on a plethora of talent in the likes of Hollywood A-listers including Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Selena Gomez, Christian Bale, Karen Gillan Steve Carell, Marisa Tomei, Melissa Leo and Finn Wittrock. McKay and Randolph create characters with witty dialogue coupled with complementary cinematography provided by Barry Ackroyd. The soundtrack carries a similar tone of "Wolf of Wall Street," with a compilation of classic rock anthems. Nicholas Britell widely recognized for his work on Steve McQueen's "12 Years a Slave," where Britell composed on set the on-screen violin performances, work songs, dances and spiritual songs rarely misses a beat this time out. Much like another AFI FEST 2015 film, "The Clan," Argentina's official entry to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Best Foreign Language Category for Oscar, "The Big Short," musical score is often in juxtaposition to the the narrative and mies-en-scene adding a deeper visceral quality to the viewing experience. In its most basic essence, "The Big Short," builds on the visceral truth of Scorsese's "Wolf of Wall Street." It depicts a not-so-long-ago present where a noble ideal, making home ownership a reality for Americans, is bastardized by the indifferent market forces of capitalism. Probably not what Adam Smith had in mind when he penned his treatise, "The Wealth of Nations." Warmly Recommended.Smart Greed Harry Knowles once wrote a review of Das Boot that said the movie was so well made that you'd find yourself rooting for Nazi sailors trying to sink American ships. So here. You find yourself rooting for clever "outsiders and weirdos," as one of them puts it, who saw what nobody else wanted to see -- that an immense structure of mortgage based securities was doomed to collapse because it rested on the backs of subprime borrowers who couldn't support the weight and should never have been loaned the money. We have been taught by generations of fiction to identify with characters who are outsiders and rebels. Because these guys are smart, because they are antisocial and because they were laughed at by smug fools who believed the conventional wisdom, you identify with them, and you wait anxiously for their vindication. Then you realize that their vindication means the collapse of the American economy. They were the guys on the Titanic who knew what the iceberg meant. Michael Lewis, from whose book the movie was adapted, got his training at Salomon Brothers in the mid-80s, as mortgage based securities were being invented. (There's an early shout-out to Lew Ranieri, the Salomon trader who invented them.) As anyone knows who's read Lewis's memoir of those days, Liar's Poker, the culture at Salomon was that your job was to be smarter than everybody else in the bond market, understand values better, and know what other traders were going to do before they knew it themselves. If you were smart enough, you deserved whatever you took away from somebody less smart on the other side of the trade. That's why Lewis admires his protagonists and that, despite a thick coating of moral outrage, is the heart of the movie. The guys who shorted the housing market weren't any more virtuous or less greedy than the great majority of complacent, conventionally minded bankers who believed that the trees would keep growing all the way up to the sky. They just saw more clearly and had plenty of nerve and faith in their own judgment. If they had been wrong, as shorts often are, they and their clients would have been wiped out. When they turned out right, they took the money and kept it, even if some of them felt guilty about it.  I know somewhat about this area, having litigated some of the aftermath. The celebrity cameo explanations of subprime debt, collateralized debt obligations, and synthetic CDOs are not only simple but accurate -- the two involving Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez are downright elegant. The key concept of the credit default swap comes out nicely through the dialogue -- a chance to buy fire insurance on the house down the street just before it catches fire. There are a couple of more points that could have used the same thing, especially when people start talking about "FICO scores." It could also have been a little more clear that the eventual collapse was delayed because the smarter investment banks like Goldman finally woke up, saw it coming, unloaded their CDO inventory on investors who were still asleep, and cut their losses by buying swaps themselves. But this is a smart, entertaining telling of an outrageous true story. It deserves all the praise it has gotten, and maybe an Oscar for best adapted screenplay. If it teaches people without a financial background a little of what went on, it will be more than a momentary entertainment. But it will certainly entertain.A delightful merging of information and comedy No subject in the world is inherently interesting or uninteresting, for it's always about the communicative method or channel used to promote or inform one about the subject that is either interesting or not. Having said that, some subjects are more alienating than others, and one of those subjects is economics/finance, largely because of its dependency upon a plethora of terminology and jargon that usually cannot be adequately defined without including other terminology or jargon. Before you know it, searching the definition of something like a "Roth IRA" leads you to Google searches about embezzlement and quantitative easing in efforts to try and circumvent and define what you were originally looking for. Thankfully, Adam McKay's The Big Short assumes the audience is fairly stupid and blissfully ignorant when it comes to the interworkings of what led to the global economic crisis of 2007-2008, which saw record unemployment and catastrophic results for the usually reliable housing market. In true movie fashion, we observe the financial crash, not from an insider standpoint, where sure-fire, grade-A trades and exchanges are being made, but by a plethora of quirky outsiders trying to run away from a boulder that keeps gaining on them until it flattens them and everyone in their tracks. The only ones saved are the ones who didn't manage to fall or stumble when pushing said boulder down the hill in the first place. We initially meet a quirky hedge fund manager named Michael Burry (Christian Bale), who discovers that the U.S. housing market is based on a series of subprime loans (which, we are told by Margot Robbie as she soaks in a bubblebath whilst sipping champagne, may as well be synonymous with "s***") and is inevitably going to collapse sometime in the second quarter of 2007. Being that the housing market is often viewed as the safest bet in America, Michael begins to go around to different banks to bet against the stability and long-term security of the housing market in efforts to profit from the impending disaster. Then there's Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), a fairly small-time investor, who winds up putting in his own money to bet against the housing market, along with Mark Baum (Steve Carell), a cynical and depressed banker of many years. The two wind up discovering that the market collapse is further aided by the solicitation of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), basically collections of the aforementioned subprime loans that come packaged together and market as competent and reliable investments. Finally, there's Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock), two young-bloods anxious to break into the financial market. The inexperienced duo enlist in the help of a retired, conservative banker named Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), who helps them make decisions with their money. Unlike the other more experienced men, both Charlie and Jamie lack the kind of gusto and namesake that allows them into the offices of big name bankers. As a result, they pine for a bigger piece of the pie in a smaller way, largely by lounging in their parents' basements, hunched over their iPads. The Big Short functions as a competent, satirical anthology that breaks down the financial crisis - that is now nearly a decade old, if you can believe that - enough to be informative and entertaining. Considering this is from Adam McKay, a frequent collaborator with Will Ferrell and Funny or Die, responsible for films like Casa De Mi Padre, The Other Guys, and Step Brothers, this is a huge step in the right direction for him as a name in comedy and satire. Rather than focusing on a bargain-barrel Spanish telenovela satire or a tired, mean-spirited comedy based around who can yell the loudest, McKay sets his sights on peddling information through the most communicable form - entertainment. If you can succeed in meriting consistent laughs while teaching an audience something, you have profoundly succeeded at two things many have a difficult time accomplishing in a separate sense. That alone is worth considerable praise. While the screenplay by McKay and Charles Randolph is undoubtedly a big part at why this film succeeds, The Big Short is a true testament to brilliant comedic acting on various cylinders, as well. The men of the hour, specifically, are both Bale and Carell, seriously taking on opposite personas that they pull off to a tee. Bale plays confused and downright quirky with just the right amount of edge to make him believable rather than hopelessly incompetent or downright silly, and Carell's sporadic bouts of rage and lack of self-awareness make him all the more watchable screen presence. Other performances, like Gosling's, who serves as the infrequent, anti-hero narrator, is notable for its brash charm, in addition to Pitt, who works largely because he's even more understated and harder to define than in his latest film By the Sea. The Big Short has a lot of comedic value, but it's nonetheless a frightening depiction of where America is currently at; a depressing oligarchy, controlled and manipulated by those with money at the mercy of those without. We've seen "The Great Recession of 2007," as it's sometimes called, plunge numerous working class and poor families into further states of hopelessness, while those who helped cause and further the effects of the recession have gone on to have a road of many ups and few downs since then. McKay's eye, ear, and talent for conducting satire in a way that's simultaneously uproariously funny, in addition to having the ability to be truly upsetting, is quite marvelous and unexpected, and one can only hope that with proper recognition and compensation for his efforts on this film, he furthers down this path rather than the one he was previously on.Right on the Money and on the Fraud 'The Big Short' is a winner. Based on Michael Lewis book of the same title, it tells the sorry story of the fraud and deceit practiced on the American people, nay, on the world by Wall Streets finance capitalism. We know the culprits: Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Lehman Bros., Morgan Stanley, Citibank, Wachovia, Crdit Suisse, UBS and on and on who invented financial instruments such as CDO, credit swaps and other fancy unintelligible names, based on mortgages, with the connivance of the credit agencies--Dow Jone, Standard and Poors and Fitch. 'The Big Short' with a light seriousness is a crash course on the duplicity of Wall Street investment bankers who earned large fees on junk bonds with triple A ratings; who bundled junk to palm off on an unsuspecting public looking for big gains by pandering to the snake oil exilir of getting rich quickly; and who feed on the niavety of the broad American have-nots with the dream of owning a home of their own. And so with some humor but much sadness are we lead through the byways of four different groups of bankers who saw the hoax for what it was and its impending implosion that would bring down the deck of cards of capitalism. And the took out bets on the market, by buying short. And they won big time! But the banks are still around, and the ratepayers footed the bailout, but at what cost! And we see this in the turmoil of the Republican party: for the discontent abroad in the US has thrown more than 25 percent of the population into poverty, loss of jobs, home, into heavy debt and no future for their children. And these banks have not reformed their ways...now they've come up with the same of gimmicks with a fancy name--something like beneficial financial tranche--as the play the same old mug's game. And like the Bourbons, t The cast is stellar--especially Christian Bale and Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling as well as the minor players. And like the Bourbons, in the words of Talleyrand, 'they learned nothing and forgot nothing', but the contempt they have for all of us. And to make the case stronger, the fools on the Supreme Court have strengthened the hands of big money and the oligopoly and the fat cats of Wall Street and the coupon clippers and the devil take the rest of us!Informative and somehow interesting... First of all don't be fooled by other reviews. This movie is neither a crap nor a masterpiece. It has a lot of technical terms and jargon from the world of economics and despite the obvious effort to explain things (including breaking the 4th wall (i.e. talking direct to the audience while looking into the camera), and cameo appearances from movies stars like Margot Robbie and Selina Gomez) you will probably fail to understand in depth the mechanics of what is happening. The world of banks, funds, bonds, financing and the stock market will remain a mystery for most of the viewers. Big names of Hollywood star in the Big Short including Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and others. They play real persons, who had an insight on the global economic crisis we probably still experiencing. As a movie it has its own style. Something of a documentary, a comedy sometimes, but essentially a drama since the crisis cost 8 million people their job and their homes. People who are impressed easily might tell you this is a "masterpiece". Believe me it isn't. But I recommend to see it. Even better at home where you can pause or rewind the movie to understand better. It is lengthy (130min) but you won't get bored. It needs some patience though especially in the beginning and not to be disappointed when terms like CDO, payouts etc. are starting to emerge.One of 2015's best films Adam McKay's "The Big Short" is the best financial movie I have seen since watching Oliver Stone's "Wall Street" (1987), but the only difference between these two movies is that this movie was based on true events. The film takes place before and during the recession of 2008 in which some aspects of this movie are pretty funny if you ask me. The movie was adapted from the book by Michael Lewis and it basically starts off with Dr. Michael J. Burry (Christian Bale) who was the first person to predict the housing market crash by actually betting against the housing market before it actually happened despite everyone else thinking that he was a crazy person. Then 20 minutes into the film we see a banker named Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) talk to a Morgan Stanley employee named Mark Baum (Steve Carell) and his coworkers and Vennett tells them that not long from now the economy is going to collapse and that nobody was even talking about it. also during the movie and in between all of the financial conversations Baum is going through a personal tragedy that I will not reveal in this review for those people that haven't seen the movie, and Baum is getting comforted between phone calls and at home by his wife (Marisa Tomei). The screenplay for this movie by McKay along with Charles Randolph took home the Oscar last year for best adapted screenplay and I had a few minor gripes with it here and there but then again it was directed by a man who normally does comedies. Then later in this movie we see 2 other men in the finance world (John Magaro and Finn Wittrock) end contacting a retired trader by the name of Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) who is the fourth person to predict the collapse of the housing market. the only major problem I had with this movie was the shaky camera angles which could have been improved on, and also I think that Adam McKay could have been more impartial instead of openly mocking the corporations but then again that is just my opinion, but otherwise the performances from Bale (who got an Oscar nomination), Gosling, Carell, and Pitt are top notch, as well as Marisa Tomei's. This is one of last year's greatest achievements in film, and I stand by this review.Surprisingly fun ride! This is one of the best films of the year, hands down. It was just incredible. This film takes a subject matter that could be considered boring by some, and totally draws you into it. It finds creative ways to break everything down for the audience, and makes it entertaining. I love how it's self aware, even at some points straight up going, "This isn't how it happened, but it's way more interesting this way." I love how it breaks the 4th wall, with celebrities who make cameos to explain complicated things to the audience. It's brilliant. I left this movie angry that this happened, it really gets you thinking.  Adam Mckay's script is fantastic. The characters are very well written, which every one being interesting and well developed. The film effortlessly blends comedy with drama, one minute making you laugh out loud, and and then it stops you right in it's tracks. There are some really heartbreaking moments here.  The acting is just phenomenal, and this is Steve Carell's best performance. It's just incredible. If he's not nominated an Oscar for this, it's robbery. It's easily better than his Foxcatcher performance. Christian Bale is great as well, playing the socially awkward Michael Burry. Brad Pitt with his limited screen time was great as well. Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer here, he's hilarious.  He's really the only character not struggling here, he's making money off all of it. This movie is extremely stylish, with brilliant editing that I hope wins it an Oscar. This film does everything it can to make everything fun, and it does a great job. This is as entertaining as it is thought provoking. Adam Mckay should tackle drama more often, as he did an extraordinary job with this. 9.5/10A fast-paced ride filled with fascinating personalities When everything in your life is looking rosy, there is always someone who will tell you that your happiness is on shaky ground. Though most of the time these nay-sayers will not profit from your misfortune, such is not the case in The Big Short, Adam McKay's ("Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues") hard-hitting comedy/drama about the collapse of the housing market in 2008. Based on the book "The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine" (2010) by Michael Lewis with a screenplay by McKay and Charles Randolph ("Love and Other Drugs"), the film centers on a group of Wall Street functionaries who, despite the industry, government, and media telling them otherwise, discover that the market for bonds based on subprime mortgages is on shaky grounds and is doomed to collapse. Supported by an outstanding ensemble cast that includes triple A-rated performers like Brad Pitt ("By the Sea") Christian Bale ("Knight of Cups"), Steve Carell ("Foxcatcher"), and Ryan Gosling ("Only God Forgives"), McKay takes highly complex material and molds it into an involving narrative that follows three sets of characters, each running on parallel paths, all intent with cashing in on the system at the expense of the average citizen. The film is narrated by Ryan Gosling who explains at the beginning that our picture of bankers as stolid and conservative citizens no longer fits the reality. They have gone, he says, "from the country club to the strip club." Like Michael Burry (Bale), they even go barefoot, sport a glass eye, listen to heavy metal music and are not the least concerned with what passes for social graces. Burry examines thousands of individual mortgages and realizes that a large number of subprime housing mortgages are "junk" and will collapse sooner rather than later. With no purpose in mind other than to benefit financially from the expected bursting of the housing bubble, Burry puts over a billion dollars of his company's money into what are known as "credit default swaps," an agreement insuring the buyer in the event of a loan default, in essence, betting against not only the housing market but the American economy. These investments, disparaged by the banks, come to the attention of Jared Vennett (Gosling), a subprime mortgage bond manager who goes into business with hedge-fund manager Mark Baum (Carell). Baum, still mourning the recent suicide of his brother is, in many ways, the film's most interesting character - abrasive and bullying, yet honest with a fine-tuned BS detector. The business also proves interesting to young investors Charles Geller (John Magaro, "Carol") and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock, "The Submarine Kid"), who recruit the knowledgeable ex-banker Ben Rickert (Pitt) to use his connections to help them work directly with the banks. At one point, Baum's team investigate a housing subdivision in Florida where they find out that many homes are in foreclosure, that mortgages were bought using the name of the family dog, and a stripper owns five homes with variable rate mortgages. Baum shudders when some young brokers tell him how they have made millions by selling subprime mortgages to the poor and to unsuspecting immigrants. To add more spice to proceedings, McKay uses celebrities talking directly to the camera in order to explain the complicated terminology used by bankers to make sure the average person has no idea what's going on. Provocatively sitting in a bubble bath and drinking champagne, actress Margot Robbie ("The Wolf of Wall Street") explains the ins-and-outs of mortgage-backed securities, while TV food personality Anthony Bourdain compares an unappetizing seafood stew with banks who market bad mortgages as a triple-A rated financial product. There is also a clever demonstration at a casino gambling table using actress Selena Gomez ("Behaving Badly") to show how Credit Default Obligations (CDOs), the bundling of bad mortgages, can lead to layers and layers of speculation. The three groups of characters cross paths at the American Securities Forum in Las Vegas where it soon becomes evident that the housing market is built on fraud and the banks are massively concealing the worthlessness of their holdings. The Big Short is one of the best films of the year, a fast-paced ride filled with fascinating personalities that entertains even when it infuriates. The mood only turns dark when you realize that the stakes are bigger than winning a game of Monopoly, bigger than who was right and who was wrong. When the market collapses in 2008 sending the economy into a tailspin, it is Rickert who points out to anyone left who still cares that the consequences for real people are not the loss of stocks but the loss of their homes, their livelihood, and, in some cases, their lives. Not to worry, though, it's not personal, just business.Excellent, ultimately bleak Accomplished and informative movie from Adam McKay and his team. Special kudos to Hank Corwin for his fast but never flashy editing. Superbly acted, with a nice little part for co-producer Brad Pitt, who is always at his best in supporting roles. Looking at some of the message board postings about this movie, it's evident that the blame game for the financial meltdown of 2007/8 continues, which kind of misses the point of the movie, which is that the whole thing has started up again. Neither governments, nor banks, nor the public seem to care enough about the damage of a cycle of boom and bust to really do anything about it. They – we – smell money. Excellent film. Mostly funny. Ultimately bleak.Tough to watch... for all the right reasons This film is tough to watch having lived through the housing crisis and unemployment meltdown of 2007 to present. It inspires righteous indignation and they are a lot of unlikable people that you encounter throughout the film. Don't get the wrong impression, this film is an absolute necessity on raw economics majors and even the fringe behavioral economists. We now spend a tremendous amount of time discussing the poor leadership and lack of responsibility that we encountered during that time period but nothing of such gross negligence should escape unnoticed (according to the film maybe it didn't). That it still shows that intelligent people will prosper even from the most ignorant, gross misconduct is somewhat painful to watch. Generally speaking, these are the films that don't make a lot of headway on the road to the Oscars but the cast is very stellar and is undeniable in their efforts to bring the story life from a very real point of view. Not shocking to me, Steve Carell turns in a superb effort with a highly nuanced performance overall. I wish them all the best on the road to the Oscars. Having lived through the time period, I never read the book but the last 6 to 10 minutes of the film make your stomach hurt long after the ending. If the point in cinema is to get a reaction or some sort of a dialogue started this movie is highly successful. This movie may bore the poop out of kids through the mid- to late 20s... but it is a hot weapon against the machine for anybody who is beyond that age range. Historical economic movies don't usually do well at the box office but pick up a hellacious head of steam later on if they're on target and this movie is. I recommend you catch it in theaters and have an interesting conversation on the way out to the parking lot and beyond.convoluted Famous writer director, Bill Wilder said if you are telling a complicated story you have to tell it in a simple way. He was right. This film wants to be funny and savvy and meaningful those are all great goals but it doesn't really achieve them. The story telling is as spastic as the camera-work is jerky, and the more it tries to make the back room dealings of corrupt banks make sense the less it does. Another key thing is that our main characters goals are to profit from the impending doom of the economy and though a few moments are supposed to make us care about them we really don't. They still come off as amoral socially odd business men out to make bank so why do we care? We don't. The attempts at hip comedy fail and are distracting--characters suddenly talking to the camera--directly to the audience, celebrity cameos trying to explain what's going on. These are just distractions. I guess they wanted an almost Michael Moore type vibe but in a more fictional type presentation. It's especially frantic on the big screen almost headache inducing during some of the 20 sec flash cut montage scenes that keep popping up. It's great the director wanted to go for a "real" movie, that he doesn't succeed is too bad. A for effort as they say does not mean he gets an A.Good...but best to be watched with an economics professor. "The Big Short" is a good film but also a film that would be tough for the average viewer to enjoy and understand. This is because although the housing bubble's burst was a mess and destroyed a lot of peoples' lives, few folks really understand it. Sure, folks know that the banks were foolish as were home buyers (since they couldn't possibly afford these homes)....but that's about as far as their understanding goes. And, with the film tossing around all sorts of insider jargon, it's sure to confuse more than entertain.  What I would LOVE to see is a pop-up video version of the film with explanatory text appearing on the screen throughout the movie to further clarify what is happening. I've seen several Japanese import films like this--and they helped to explain cultural references that most non-Japanese viewers would miss.  The bottom line is that I am extremely well educated compared to the average person and yet I sometimes felt a bit lost. Enjoyable but best watched with an economics professor sitting in the room to explain it all in detail.Embarrassingly Inaccurate A vapid, preachy and historically false movie that is based upon fiction that the uneducated and uninformed will obediently lap up.  The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 added thousand upon thousands of pages of regulations that forced banks to lend money to low-income areas. Yes, forced.  This is the typical liberal prescription for all the ailments of society: Throw logic and reason out the window, and use a warm and fuzzy touchy-feeling legislation to try to fix an imagined injustice.  The Federal government (through the FDIC and FFIEC) required banks and mortgage companies to advertise and make super-low mortgage loans to people who should not have been buying a house in the first place.  If the banks refused to take on these dangerous loans, they risked steep fines, being audited, and even being taken over by the government while that particular bank was being given (yes, given) to another bank in the area.  So what did banks do? They made loans to everyone. What did that do? Made house prices SOAR. Which did what? Turned a $50,000 house into a $150,000 house. Now you have a family, who barely had any money to being with, trying to pay a $1,000 mortgage when their total income was maybe twice that. Their home gets re-assessed by the government, then their property taxes skyrocket.  Why? Because the leftists and liberals said 'everyone deserves the right to own a home'. People began defaulting on loans. Missing payments. Houses were repossessed. The market crashed.It Was OK I Guess Not really an accurate portrayal of the housing bust. The movie makes it out like these few people were the only ones who knew there was a problem brewing. Uh, no, zillions of people knew as early as 2004, including me, and I'm no Einstein. What set these guys apart is that they figured out a good way to profit from the coming collapse, although it was never made exactly clear just what sort of percentage return they made. The Michael Burry character was portrayed as an annoying mental case which seemed wrong to me since I've seen videos of the guy giving various speeches and he never struck me as a nutjob except in this movie. Didn't care for the bimbo in the bathtub explaining financial jargon to the viewers. Very contrived. No laying of any blame on the people who bought houses they couldn't afford. A lot of those people were closer to idiots than victims. The victim was ME, I bailed all you dumbasses out and you'd better believe it ain't over yet! Round 2 coming up.A thorough analysis of the 2008 financial collapse with an oxymoronic title One would think that in the absolute least it would be extremely difficult to make an intriguing movie about the housing market and the US banking system and the greedy people who invest and gamble with our country's future... while keeping a cyber-age audience entertained, but The Big Short not only manages to accomplish that goal but does it excellently. The major drawback to this film is that the pace is too fast for an average viewer to sort out who's who from a host of actors, each of whom portrays a key player in a complex intertwined financial system. That being said, this film targets the painful nerve of every American, a nerve that careens through their job security, affecting their monetary value and terminates in the core of their family's welfare: the place they cherish and call their home, for every man's home is his "castle" and whoever messes with a man's castle, is messing with the man's family. The repressed anger of the American people over the 2008 crises and the memories of the financial loss they have endured will be inflated as they watch this film and then "pricked" by the irritating, aggravating and infuriating outcome. Those who plan to watch it should plan on watching it twice and plan to clench a lead bullet between the back teeth.Well told true story As a person who understands how this housing bubble burst (not affected personally) - this is a well told story. The acting is great - the inserts of a chef explaining things, and a pop star - very interesting tactic. The individual characters are all well acted and developed. Many people do not get that the banks play games with the average person - as it says at the end of the movie - they just use different words for their products. The main focus of the bank is to make money - not help the consumer and this was rampant in the 90's. People need a place to live - do not put down your income-or lack of. Leave some of the questions blank - no one will care by the time it gets passed off and passed off and passed off and approved. ARM's - to me an automatic money maker for the mortgage holder and not the homeowner - oh that is right the mortgage holder owns the home. This is a movie that more people should see - the acting is great - the story is told well and all need to watch what happens in the future.The Big Mess Okay. So why is 'The Big Short' an average film? It's messy. Tonally, it's all over the place, featuring inconsistent uses of fourth wall breaks, random advertisements and clips scattered throughout, and sitting up in the director's chair, we have Adam McKay. The director of Anchorman (along with many other Ferrell-starring comedy vehicles), was not the right man to tell this story. Don't get me wrong, the subject matter is very interesting and necessary, adapted from the 2010 book of the same name which focuses on the financial crisis that hit in '07; but with such an important story to tell, was McKay the right man for the job? I'll let you decide. Unfortunately, I feel though his vision is scattered and the final product is rather uneven. The Best Director Oscar nomination is certainly surprising. It's the inconsistencies and lack of attention to the small details that bothered me. The film has an excellent soundtrack, in terms of song choices, but the way 50% of the songs are used, feels very poorly applied. Jarring cuts, odd mixing levels, etc. The same goes for the fourth wall breaks. We meet Jared Vennett (played by Ryan Gosling, who is excellent here) within the first few moments of the film, who essentially introduces the subject matter to us. It's okay, I can buy that, it's sort of reminiscent of Leo's discussions with the camera in The Wolf of Wall Street. But the fourth wall breaks that feel totally out of place, were (to name a few) the cut to Margot Robbie in the bubble bath, Selena Gomez gambling, even the ones between various supporting cast members. It took me out of the film for sure, I don't know about you. Gosling does get the most frequent asides though, which I was okay with. He certainly has a Leo-esque style about him. So, it's 2005. Bare foot, shorts sporting Dr. Mike Burry (Christian Bale) has realised that the American housing market is very unstable, as it's built upon subprime loans that are providing fewer returns. In the film's terms, the market is built upon a bubble that he predicts will 'burst' within the next couple of years. Burry decides to bet against the housing market, creating a credit default swap (CDS) market which the banks gleefully accept, since they genuinely believe that there's no way in hell that the collapse will occur. It's Burry's actions that are the catalyst for those of the film's other major players. Vennett, previously mentioned above, hears of Burry's unusual actions and comes to the realisation that he is absolutely right. The market is becoming increasingly unstable and so as Vennett jumps on board Burry's train of thought, Mark Baum (Steve Carrell) by accident hears of his actions and... yeah, you're getting the picture. Baum joins Vennett, hoping to profit from the CDS's as the result of the economy's collapse. Other players include young naïve investors Charlie and Jamie (John Magaro and Finn Wittrock), who come across one of Vennett's papers; and Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) a retired banker, and old friend of Jamie's, who is one of the few figures who have a genuine fear concerning the losses of jobs and homes as a result of the eminent bubble burst. I'll say it again, the information is important, the subject matter is brilliant, but at times, the way McKay and Randolph's screenplay "dumbs-things-down" for it's audience is totally ridiculous. And even then, watching a nude bathing Margot Robbie is enough to completely distract so you don't know what the hell she's talking about. Other points in the film throw so much financial jargon at you, it's hard to keep up, unless you go home from the cinema and try to google everything before you forget what you heard. If you can completely understand the concept of CDO's (basically "re-packaged poor loans"), after one viewing of this film, then I take my hat off to you. This review makes it sound like I hated the film, I realise that, but there is a lot to like here. Gosling's performance (and in particular the workplace bathroom scene) deserves praise. The honest human empathy and fear of the future reality expressed by Pitt certainly restored my faith in what seemed to be a world of greed and ease associated with turning a blind eye. Rickert states "If we're right, people lose homes. People lose jobs. People lose retirement savings, people lose pensions. You know what I hate about f_cking banking? It reduces people to numbers. Here's a number - every 1% unemployment goes up, 40,000 people die, did you know that?". But I can't seem to shake how disjointed the whole film is. The poor music cuts, the uneven direction, the (overrated) dodgy editing; I genuinely wish I liked it more than I did, because it's got the appeal, but sadly, falls short on both style and occasionally, substance.A Joke with a Serious Crisis In the end of 2007, the world saw one of the greatest crisis in the United States of America, the real estate bubble that affected and devastated the American economy.  "The Big Short" is a comedy that plays with the housing mortgage fraud of the bank and some of the players that foresaw the housing bubble and started hedge funds to make money. The screenplay is confused for those that are not familiar with details of the financial concepts and investments. The cameo appearance of personalities explaining concepts does not work well. My vote is five. Title (Brazil): "A Grande Aposta" ("The Big Bet")Best Film of the Year An absolutely brilliant adaptation of Michael Lewis' novel. I can't say enough about this film. I've watched it countless times and I still get something from it each time. The script, the cinematography, the casting - all brilliant. Steve Carell is superb as Mark Baum and Christian Bale is at the top of his game. He's never been better. Adam McKay has crafted a masterpiece for the ages. He clearly possesses a brilliant mind. What astonishes me is that he wastes his considerable talents on dreck like "Anchorman" and "Talladega Nights" and "Step Brothers." Why? I mean, WHY?!?!?! It just don't add up! The man should stick to smart and insightful films like "The Big Short" and leave the juvenile, unfunny comedies to Kevin Smith and Seth Rogan.Left wing opinion masquerading as fact Some good acting (I especially like Bale) and interesting tricks like having actors talk to the audience and having celebrities explain complex financial deals. Unfortunately it distorts reality to match a Leftist viewpoint, and repeats ad nauseam how evil bankers are. Conveniently left out is the pressure the government put on banks. Check out the history of the Community Reinvestment Act, particularly Bill Clinton's "coup de whiskey" which forced banks to accept junk housing loans. This is why such a large percentage of mortgages failed. This was NOT mentioned in the film; how can this not be relevant? Also, it was well known that housing loans were in trouble before the crash. I remember a cover article in The Economist predicting disaster in housing around 2005. I think the bankers were thinking, yeah, it's crazy, but the government is forcing us to do it so they are going to cover these loans in the end so they are secure. At least with Michael Moore you know he is lying to you; with this movie a lot of people accept it as fact.Well made Even though it's overused, I loved the self-conscious style of the story. Financial terms that are difficult to understand for the laymen are explained by people that have nothing to do with finance. This isn't cute or funny the way it sounds, it's satirical and sad because of how absurd the whole thing was. Combined with wonderful performances, by Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, the story becomes enjoyable and not as boring as the film admits the story to be in the beginning. On the other hand, I couldn't help but feel that the film was emotionally inconsistent. I am not suggesting that films of this nature should be balanced. Sure, there's always drama in satire but the dramatic scenes of the film were not enough to warrant themselves in respect with the whole. There should have been better management of these scenes so that either they are balanced, or they are so imbalanced that they become more than they seem. I haven't read the book, but the film is well-made and worth a watch.Great film - energetic and interesting Based on the true story of how the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) came about from 2005-2008, 'The Big Short' tells the story really well by mixing humour, facts (delivered in an unconventional way by celebrities) and following four tenuously-linked groups who have skin in the game. Vennett (Gosling) introduces us at the start of 2005, via a unique fourth-wall-breaking monologue, placing the players on the field - I'm using this terminology, as most of the film (and Wall Street in general) can be likened to gambling. It may sound boring on the surface - a film about banking and finance - but it does a great job of explaining the terminology in simple terms, whilst not being condescending about it. The groups involved are Burry (Bale), a fund manager and prodigy of sorts, who first sees the housing bubble and notices that the big banks have been over-valuing mortgages (sub-prime). Baum (Carell) and his small company are offered the opportunity to "short" the banks' mortgages by Vennett. Geller (Magaro) &amp; Shipley (Wittrock), two young entrepreneurs, who seek help from their mentor, retired Wall St mogul Rickert (Pitt) also pick up on what' happening and get in on the action. It's great to see the banks gleefully taking their money, being so cocky and greedy, only to have it all blow up in their faces two years later. I think Carell, not Bale, should have been Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor! Baum serves as the film's moral centre and calls everyone on their fraudulent behaviour. The film almost acts as a documentary when it delves down to the individual family level and makes you truly realise how little these large corporations care for other humans. The most bittersweet part is the ending - "and then the crooks went to jail, Congress brought in reform and the fraudulent system was overhauled - just joking! They didn't go to jail, Congress was lobbied so no reform was passed and the big banks were bailed out by the taxpayers" - funny, sad, and true. Really makes you think, but is also a well-made film with excellent acting.Movie is too profound to be entertaining Humorous and funny? NOT !! I didn't laugh once. I only got a C in Economics and all the terminology of selling "short", CDOs and other code words, made for a dull 130 minutes. Only Steve Carell comes off as a moral, person with a conscience, worried about the bank collapse consequences. Christian Bale's character is outstandingly perceptive, while Gosling and the two from Boulder are out to get rich and they do. This tells a story similar to Wall Street and Wolf of Wall Street,but too technical to care. Obviously people got screwed,but as a movie,it makes me indifferent.Short changed... A complicated story navigated by some good actors, with the requisite Hollywood handwringing thrown in, at the end... This is a very contemporary topic that deserved to be explored in a cinematic sense... but I'm sorry, I just can't make myself care about the minutiae, no matter how hard I try... If you're au fait with the financial landscape, it's an impressive and engaging watch, though!A more suitable title would have been 'The Big Stinker'. Originally reviewed: (26/12/2016) The Big Short tries to be both Oliver Stone's Wall Street and Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street at the same time but fails miserably. The Film apparently stars four bankers but the screen time for each of them is divided poorly as Steve Carell has the most scenes in the picture. This is a problem as personally I found Christian Bale's character a lot more interesting and curious than anyone else within the picture. Ryan Gosling is extremely Narcissistic and unlikeable and Brad Pitt has no right being on the front cover, as there are plenty of other less known actors that have a lot more screen time than him. Furthermore there are two awful pointless cameos involving Margot Robbie and the utterly talentless Selena Gomez. If this is a comedy then why is it so hauntingly boring and void of humour, okay so they have a couple of chuckles early on but this picture goes on for 2 hours and feels like eternity, it's just nonstop dialogue with actors going through the motions in a so-so story that will be forgotten within a week of having watched it. The Big Short is nothing more than shameless dreary Oscar bait.A White Supremacy Film The movie itself is good, that I have to say. However, in the choice of actors, the file it is full of stereotype: 1. Minorities and female roles are simply silly or greedy as depicted by this film. Especially, all three Asian role are negative, either greedy or dumb.  2. All smart guys that see through the shorts are white male.  3. No white female are positive either.  4. Most of the people in the film that are not white male simply accept the living under the fraud and dare not to doubt it. Only white males are "courageous and smart" enough to make a difference. Conclusion: I cannot say the deception is intentional, however, it is so stereotyped and misleading.Ruined the ending . . . Was a little tough to follow because there were so many different people/entities involved. I'm sure if I saw it again, it would be more clear. Was thoroughly enjoying the movie until they got political at the very end. I won't spoil it for anyone, but they said something about immigration that offended me. When the movie was over, I couldn't help but taste the political remarks they dropped at the end of the movie.  Hollywood seems to have forgotten that we watch movies for entertainment. Even if we have wonderful fulfilling lives already, we want to vicariously experience something else when we watch movies. I was enjoying the movie until Hollywood took a dump in my living room.Economics as a confusing way of the world **** May contain strong spoilers **** This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading.... This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world. A genuine solid movie about economics. A story that has a lot to say both in the perspective of it being an authentic story, and also about how the world is fictionalized to create scenarios of the financial worlds. Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Solid. Very good. - The actors : A movie that gained attention in the Academy Award world. Says it all. - Entertainment : If you like an drama with a true story behind and the almost confusing world of economics; yes. - Age : 15 7,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)Big on Fantasy &amp; Fiction, Short on Fact and Accuracy I do have concerns about this genre of film; portraying real events in film is always a difficult proposition, when the makers want to try to make it entertaining this is where the conflicts between truth and fact become at odds with the entertainment (film) industry. The subject matter is far too complex to cram one story in 2 hours, it would just do the facts no justice at all. To try to run three concurrent stories makes for short on fact and big on spin. With this in mind the film seems to have no identity; It isn't a fact based drama, the actors' quips to camera make it appear like a light hearted thriller – which it is neither. What it is is an interesting watch to wile away 2 hours, but that is it. The performance of Christian Bale was awful, not for one moment did I ever feel that the character was real, his mannerisms in trying to portray Dr. Burry's afflictions were amateur at best and way over the top as to be irritating, every time he stuttered, stammered or pulled a strange face the irritation clicked up another notch. This was one of Christian Bale's worst performances on screen. Steve Carrel should stick to what he does best; comic acting where an OTT performance can add to the film not detract from it; his fixed chaotic hair style just about as irritating as Christian Bales acting, just about...Brad Pitt's performance was also pretty dire, caught between (and failing on both counts) trying to be a Robert Redford look-a-like and neo hippy off grid ex-banker was wasteful of his talents, he should be doing better than a poor cameo role.THE most informative film I have ever seen. By far THE most informative film I have ever seen which offered a highly detailed look at the worst financial meltdown in over 3/4 of a century. This film is a one of a kind for me, never have I ever paid so much attention to the information given out by a film to the point where I'm taking notes and pausing to reflect on what it all means.  This all coming from a topic in which I had only a passing interest in discovering what exactly happened but throughout the course of this film the passing interest turned into a burning desire to figure out the whole story and enrich myself with new knowledge.  The information was given in such a gentle and flowing way that you were thoroughly enjoying finding out new words and phrases used in the financial circle many of which were handed out with the subtlety of Lehman's terms in a jocular way such as Margot Robbie laying naked in a bath while telling you the finer points of bonds and subprime mortgages. The fluidity in which the story moves along with the information makes you feel blessed in what you've learned and once you've figured out the exact cause and order of the collapse you feel like an all powerful knowledge robot.  I think this film will undoubtedly divide opinion because the manner in which it must be viewed to consume every last drop of information is vital, for example you hardly want to watch this film at a cinema where you have no chance to pause and reflect and figure out what's going on because the film is already powering forward. Overall I would have to say this film feels likes a once in a lifetime watch where you take a subject that only slightly interested me and somehow through genius and to a degree a certain amount of showbiz glitz make me thoroughly obsessed with figuring it all out and seeing the picture that the puzzle pieces formed.  A sheer work of art by the writers, directors and by a AAA rated cast, and rest assured my rating system isn't fraudulent.Excuse me who liked the movie , but I found it very boring The Big Short in my opinion is the worst movie of the nominees in Oscar, found a boring movie with slow pace and moments trying to be funny more does not work ( at least for me ) , the cast is a strong point of the film, Christian Bale , Steve Carell , Ryan Gosling , Brad Pitt , John Magaro , Karen Gilian , Melissa Leo , Marisa Tomei, and have a rapid participation of Selena Gomes and other Margot Robbie that and Fri and very good, the direction of Adam McKay reasonable , I found very similar film with the Wolf Wall Street, the script is good, the Big Short in my opinion not work in humor, the performances are even good , plus the pace and slow, the movie is kind of boring with time and dull and unnecessary , besides being much like the Wolf Wall Street (which is very good) , plus the script of the film is even good, plus my view Adam McKay could not use well the good script had. Note 5.6Adam McKay makes a great financial comedy crisis film. THE BIG SHORT IS BIG ON STORY, BIG ON MONEY, BIG ON PERFORMANCES, and BIG ENTERTAINMENT! (From what I can understand about it) The Big Short is the dramatic true story of the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis revealing the global market collapse through the eyes of those who saw it coming and figured out ways to profit from it. We also get an inside look into the world of money, greed, Wall Street, business, chaos, corruption and outcast. The films main cast includes, Christian Bale (The Dark Knight Trilogy, American Psycho), Ryan Gosling (Drive, The Nice Guys), Steve Carell (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Seeking a Friend For the End of the World), and Brad Pitt (Fight Club, 12 Years a Slave). The Big Short is directed by Adam McKay (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Step Brothers). Adam McKay may not be the first guy you think of to direct a project like The Big Short. On the other hand, McKay directs a good flick, and brings a nice financial comedy crisis film (is that a thing?) to the public. BATMAN AND BRICK TAMLAND Talking' MONEY?! For starters, the cast is amazing! Everyone truly does give it their all. Especially Christian Bale and Steve Carell. It was nice to see Steve Carell play a character that isn't similar to Brick Tamland. Between this and Fox catcher, Steve Carell is really becoming one of my favorite serious toned actors, who can really transform themselves in a way we haven't seen. There's something about a angry Steve Carell that makes great entertainment. (Brick Tamland – "I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE YELLING ABOUT!") Now for me, this film was a little confusing at time. However, Adam McKay does a good job of simplifying it for the general audience, and makes us care about something most people find confusing or have little interest in. It's not that I don't care for banking, and how this seriously affected people. It's just the movie is a little lengthy, and it's a ton of numbers, credits, smart people talking, and words that made me pause the movie to look up the definition (man I must sound like an idiot). They even have celebrity cameos to help people like me to understand. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but a popular Australian beauty shows up drinking champagne while sitting in bubble bath, to explain what is going on at that moment. (I hardly understood, but man I wanted to get in on that bubble bath and champagne!) One thing I really enjoyed were when the characters break the fourth wall to address the viewer(s). It was funny, well written, and once again, made the plot of the movie easier to follow. In my opinion, the direction, writing, characters, and style really work.  So these are my final *Bleeping* Buddha thoughts on The Big Short. It's a good movie, it's educational, with exceptional performances, techniques, and something worth seeing. This film may not be for everyone, but the performances, writing, and drama are the real show stealers. Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling's characters are there really to explain things. I would have liked to see more depth to their characters. As Brick Tamland said, "I like lamp.", and I like this movie. I believe The Big Short earns a 7/10 This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading and or viewing, and I hope you have an amazing day as always.overly simplistic black comedy fun! My mother is a loan officer and last night we were flipping through Netflix for a movie to watch. I was happy to see this film there (Netflix takes forever with some films) and was glad to see it with my mom because for once, if i didn't understand a film, she could explain it to me instead of vice versa. Thankfully it was a simple enough narrative i didn't need to ask too many questions. She felt the film was mostly accurate but a bit one sided. too much emphasis is put on the 'big bad banks' and not enough on the irresponsibility of the average joe in that time. two scenes in particular explain this: (SPOILERS) the scene with the stripper where she explains she has about eight houses, all bought with loans, and the scene in Florida where they to go to collect from that guy, only to find out it's his landlord in trouble who has fled. those are probably two of the biggest reasons we got in such deep crap. People buying things with the money they do not have. It is not the greed of banks, it is the greed and manipulation of the system BY THE PEOPLE. My mother is Mexican, and speaks fluent Spanish, so she would get all the 'problematic loans'. what does that mean? she'd get the loans from immigrant people who claimed to have no money. Only, once she started to investigate, she'd find they were paid in cash, under the table, sent that money home, claimed they were poor and qualified for everything social under the son. even the wife of OUR GARDENER said she was single so her kids would qualify for wellbabies and whatever else insurance and perks her kids got at school. so while I applaud the filmmakers for taking such a serious subject and turning it into something more people wanna watch (because this film SHOULD be watched) I wish they hadn't taken such a left approach and been more neutral. a lot to ask from Hollywood, i guess. other than that, fun fantastic cast that gave the film a great energy, the element of breaking the 4th wall always brings in the laughs among the other black comedy in the film. a generally enjoyable film, even if i eventually felt it ran too long.Great acting with a confusing concept. 4/10 Review: I really had high hopes for this movie, mainly because of the brilliant cast but I didn't know what the hell was going on most of the time and the Wall Street jargon, became way too technical for me. There was too many characters that were doing different things and I personally think that it became a bit messy after a while. I deliberately didn't want to know anything about the plot before I watched it but if I knew that it was based around the property crash during 2008, I definitely would have watched it with someone else so they could explain to me what was going on. Out of all of the top stars in this film, Steve Carell and the brash Ryan Gosling, were brilliant but it would have helped if I knew what the hell they were talking about. Don't get me wrong, I get the main concept of the movie and I knew who was good and who was bad but if your not from that world, I really don't know how your supposed to understand there various phrases and different methods of tricking the market to make billions of dollars. Brad Pitt and Christian Bale also put in good performances and they played there roles convincingly but I still was confused most of the time. Basically, it's worth a watch, just for the performances but from an entertainment point of view, it really didn't do it for me. Disappointing but watchable. Round-Up: With such an enormous cast, the box office takings were pretty disappointing, and I'm sure that a lot of the money was made after getting nominated for a few Oscars. It did win in the Best Writing category, even though I found it quite confusing but it lost out to Spotlight in the Best Movie category. I can understand why this movie is so appealing, because it explains how the stock market crashed and how so many people lost there homes and jobs, so it is a significant movie for this time and age but they will have to release The Big Short for dummies for me to get it. It was written and directed by Adam McKay, 48, who also brought you Anchorman 1 &amp; 2, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers and The Other Guys, so this film was definitely a change of genre for a director who had primarily made movies for the comedy market. The script was slightly witty and I liked the way that Ryan Gosling was narrating through the film, which gave it a lighter feel, even though it was dealing with a delicate moment in time. I still would have to watch it again to fully understand it and I'm sure that I'm not alone when it came to the confusing technical jargon.  Budget: $28million Worldwide Gross: $133.3million I recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/drama/comedies starring Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, Marisa Tomei, Hunter Burke, Rudy Eisenzopf, Casey Groves, Charlie Talbert, Shauna Rappold, Brandon Stacy, Peter Epstein, Melissa Leo and Anthony Marble. 4/10A film about bankers "The Big Short" is a film with Steve Carell and some other folks about things in the banking industry that lead to the 2008 recession. Various banking guys discover issues in the industry that could lead to a potential market collapse. At the least, they uncover fraudulent and deceptive practices. A lot of the movie seems to be scenes in which hotshots from Bank A with knowledge about problematic mortgages visit bigwigs from Bank B hoping to cash in or learn more about the problem by shielding themselves from sharing the ultimate issue at hand. "You mean you don't do income verification when giving people mortgages?" "No, we don't." And more questions from the Bank A people follow. Never a desire to set such people straight and tell them that people's jobs and lives are at stake, never a desire to wonder if their participation in the banking industry itself should be questioned. Steve Carell's character, always looking to point out and draw out the problem and bringing attention to it without providing a path forward to how to tighten up this practice and prevent it form happening in the future. Sorry, can't identify. Part of the film seems to be a crusade against "big banking capitalists" by noting that the poor and working class will be affected by these sketchy mortgage deals, but then by the end of the movie the main characters appear to cash in themselves on such an industry. You uncovered the problem, brilliant, but then don't have either the moral fortitude or wherewithal about how to lead things forward to a stronger future. I guess, that is, because you are simply bankers. Features a rather strange performance by Christian Bale.the end of capitalism? Was Karl Marx right with his critics and analysis about the capitalist system, its crisis, and inequalities? The question must have crossed the minds of many people faced with the periodic failures of the world economy and financial systems in the last couple of decades, which seem to have made the poor poorer, ruined into poverty millions of people who were part of the middle class, while making many of the rich richer. The question is asked indirectly also by the makers of 'The Big Short' directed by Adam McKay, probably the best film made until now about the crush of the real-estate market followed by the financial system which started in 2007, and to some extent continues until today. The housing market in the United States was expanding and seemed to be rocky solid in the 1990s and the early 2000s. It was supported by a banking system which did not only provided the credits that allowed all the strata of the population reach the house of their dreams, but also created new money from money and profits from profits for the investors. This kind of bubble BTW persists until today and endangers all the capitalist economy. The film describes how a few people involved with the investment funds and banking systems had foreseen the fall ('The Big Short') and made a profit out of it investing in credit default swaps, kind of insurance policies against the deficit of a system which was supposed never to fail. If you want this was like buying insurance policies against earthquakes with the confidence that an earthquake will happen in the next two years in one of the most stable areas in the world. Director McKay took a documentary book (Michael Lewis' "The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,") and turned it into docu-fiction of the best quality. In order to explain how the system worked he used the narrator who is also one of the heroes (played by Ryan Gosling) and a few real life celebrities to explain the dry financial terms. I certainly did not become an expert in economics after seeing this film, but I can understand what chef Antoine Bourdelle means with taking lower quality ('B rated') sea-food and putting it in his bouillabaisse, package with his 'AAA rated' prestige. The smart heroes take life each on screen thanks to well written dialogues and fine performances of such actors as Gosling, Christian Bale, Steve Carell, or Brad Pitt. 'The Big Short' proves that the financial and banking system that is supposed to support the capitalist economy is ill. It also proves that Hollywood at its best can make relevant movies that touch real life, while being good entertainment for smart viewers. In what concerns the question 'was Karl Marx right?' the answer is in my opinion that he was right in part of the analysis of the capitalist system, but was completely wrong in what concerns the cure. If a cure exists for the capitalist system, its name is certainly not communism.Getting the short end Although many would argue the end is not in sight. Not for a long time it won't be. Especially if nothing changes in America concerning politics. But that would be stretching it now. The movie just makes it even more important to know what you vote and why you vote for it. What happened in America (and what is surely still happening to at least a degree) caused an earthquake which rippled all over the world. Financial crisis still roaming in some countries. Not that those countries didn't "help" by making bad choices themselves too. But it's amazing what banks are still allowed to do and how they won't ever will be made responsible for their mistakes (unless a politician finally steps up and makes them - of course that man or woman would have to be elected president first). But back to this movie, with its weird mix of comedy and cold hard facts. It's tough to laugh at times and it's tough to understand the whole picture too. Which is why we get interludes with famous people playing themselves, explaining important plot points (or rather real life incidents/information) for the viewer to be able to actually get behind it all. The fourth wall is broken a lot, the movie tells us the whole time what is up. It's also telling is from time to time, that events didn't exactly occurred as presented, making fun of the process itself. It might be too clever for its own good, or at least in the perception of some viewing, who might have preferred a more straight/head-on approach. But if you dig what they did here, you'll get an excellent movie nonetheless"The system is ran by stupidity..." The truest truth I've heard in a movie. Presented to the audience with a mixture of award winning performances, fourth-wall breaking narration, and snippets of documentary type photos, this true story breaks down the limits Hollywood seems to usually put on itself and lets the truth ring like the Stock Market's closing bell.  Summary: Because I'm one of the simple folk that this movie talks down to in a playful, I can't accurately summarize the movie except to say that some people see the housing market bubble before anyone else, and decided to gamble against the housing market to make money. I've enjoyed this movie so much, I'm writing the review before I even finish it, so you don't have to worry about spoilers.  As a simple folk myself, who happens to work in an organization in which I can truly see stupidity marching in front of the pack in the most self-assured way as it leads its way right on into proverbial hell, I can honestly say that this movie makes an artful and accurate representation of what happens when greed is allowed to breed within society, and within those who hold the 1% of the nation's wealth. But the movie is not a statement on which political party should accept fault for the housing market bubble bursting. Instead it simply looks at the big name banks that were either too shady or too stupid to see the bubble themselves and do something to prevent millions of Americans from being forced from their homes and fired from jobs. This isn't the kind of drama that has weepy tears and over the top scenes of intense passion... although you might be able to count the snippets of cynicism and anger, or maybe the confusion and excitement. I don't count it, because the information and dialogue thrown at you at a pace that makes random numbers and technical jargon sound so cool and exciting that the emotions and feelings come second to the full force of how so many people could be blinded to one simple truth. That is, until the very end, when the "heroes" of the film realize that even if they get a 20 to 1 or 200 to 1 return on their investments, they're winning at the expense of those millions of Americans. That weight is palpable as it comes crashing through each scene, "the housing market is built on lies and deceit."  The movie should be watched by every young adult to explain how a mindless, self-absorbed approach to life can lead to far-reaching, terrible, consequences. It's theme that I find most appealing, and the is that apathy that comes as a consequence of self preservation may usually seem like a low risk decision, but it is in fact an investment into a hollow way of life that will simply collapse under the weight of its massive fallibility.A movie about how it all went down - mortgages, banks, investors and people. The thing about most scams is that the schemers usually get away with it (well some might land up in jail after making tonnes of money). Its the people they have conned that suffer - and these people are everyday people like you and me. This is exactly what happen during the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Banks, investors, funds managers, and people remotely connected to the financial world - all made money. Except the people on whose name the mortgages were on. What is it about The Big Short based on a book by Michael Lewis (The blind side, Moneyball fame), is a good movie - its not great and I will tell you why in a bit. But lets start with the good stuff. It has big names who acted pretty well - Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt and Christian Bale. The characters they portrayed are all real people and that's what made it interesting. Christian Bale is Dr. Michael Burry, the man who predicted it all. As early as 2005, he knew the Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), the instruments with which bankers were making loads of money already, were made even more lucrative with sub-prime mortgages filled in them. His prediction and solution to make money for his investors is one story. The other parallel story is of Steve Carell - again a fund manager working for Morgon Stanley. He is angry and by moving back and forth during the movie they tell you why. His story is about his dilemma - of looking for a loophole in the system but hoping against hope that there is no fraud. The third parallel story is about 2 new fund managers, kids in the big bad world of finance, who have made good money already by picking the right stocks for their investors but chance upon the sub-prime crisis pretty early on and take the help of Brad Pitt to short the MBS. The street-smart, suave Ryan Gosling is the one who kind of stitches all three parallel stories together in his own cool ways. He is in it to make money as well but not at the forefront. Why it didn't work (for me) It's a complex plot, people with no understanding of the sub-prime crisis will find it really difficult to follow this movie and that is why Adam McKay, the director has tried to provide bite sized finance lessons with the help of famous people like Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain, Selena Gomez etc. But I don't think it will help people who just want easy movies where you don't have to follow each and every dialogue. That's where the movie lost out for me. The big short is convoluted, its difficult to follow because it keeps zipping through multiple stories and characters (I personally like this style but for such an intricate movie, this didn't work). Though all the actors have done their bits well, it feels almost clinical - it didn't bring out the emotions that it should have - the grossness of it all, the pathetic situation of people like you and me or anger that not many people who were responsible for the crisis went to prison. Maybe that's what the movie is about, the smugness of all the people who did what they did by cheating normal people and didn't give a dime about people who lost their houses and jobs. Why you should still watch it Watch it to understand a bit about the crisis - after all its part of history, something that happened and affected millions of people around the world. Also watch it for Steve Carell. I usually don't like his antiques and comic sense, but he has done a brilliant job in this one - his shock of finding it all out, perplexity of what one should do in position of power and his really emotional outburst is a joy to watch. I forgive him for all the crappy movies he ever did. :) I give The Big Short a C+. Did you think it was better than what I thought of it?A Different Look at the Housing Crisis of 2008 Based on the same housing economic meltdown in 2008, The Big Short covers the story from the different viewpoint of a few who saw it coming. Michael Burry (Christian Bale), was a physician and hedge fund manager, creator of Scion Capital LLC. He was the first to recognize the impending doom of the careless practices by financial institutions and bet heavy on the housing market bubble to burst in a big way. He was so confident in his analysis that he used $1 Billion of his investors money. Some of his investors were more than displeased and pulled out in 2006 and 2007. When the market crashed in 2008, Burry profited $100 million for himself and another $700 for his remaining investors. He was quoted as saying, "I don't go out looking for good shorts. I'm spending my time looking for good longs." Banker Jared Vennett (Ryan Gossling) and another hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell) caught wind of what Burry was up to and jumped in as well. Some young investors accidentally discovered what Vennett was up to and talked Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), an ex stocks trader, into taking part.  The Big Short was nominated for Best Picture of the Year and Bale was nominated for his supporting role. It won for Best Adapted Screenplay. The preview looks to be a stinging look at the corporate greed that rocked the world with a bit of humor as a small group forms a bit of a financial coup. However, the humor is either going to be one of those "it's funnier because it's true" situations, or it will illicit a sort of "ha-ha-ouch" at just how crippling their ignorance and greed was, and still remains today. I anticipated rating this 3.5 stars. Throughout the movie, I dropped down to 2.5, but raised it up to a final verdict of 3.0 stars. It's entertaining, well-acted, but sometimes hard to follow. What helped me raise it up was that the movie self-admits that it's own subject matter is boring and confusing. It takes breaks from the film in unique ways to help those of us not in the know what exactly is going on. I was still confused at parts during the film, but those moments of "banking for dummies" definitely helped. These breaks are done through an artistic method called "breaking the fourth wall". In theatre and in film, when you as an audience member are looking at a scene with 3 walls in a room, the fourth wall is assumed to be where the camera is positioned. You take it for granted that there is a fourth wall and don't think about the cameras and cables and directors and monitors, etc that are actually there. When an actor on stage acknowledges the audience by speaking directly to them, or in a movie when you are addressed by the actor breaking away from the movie, they are ultimately admitting that there is no fourth wall, that this is just a play or a movie and that there are people watching in one way or another. Gossling's character helps to drive the story much like a narrator in a Shakespearean play who introduces the plot with a prologue, has a couple recapping monologues and then sums it up with a prologue.  Unfortunately for The Big Short, if you watched any television at all or were on the internet or picked up a paper in late 2008, most of the things covered in the movie, we already knew. The banks started making more money off of mortgages by clumping them into bundles. They were secure with the best ratings meaning that there was almost no chance the mortgages wouldn't be paid back. The banks made a ton of money. Eventually, housing for the qualified homeowners started to dry up and the bonuses started to shrink. That's when they started lumping in some riskier mortgages in to the bundle. No one did background checks and the mortgages written were only for a short introductory period that would then balloon into 200 to 300 per cent of the original payback rate. When the introductory period ended and millions found they couldn't afford their payments, millions lost their homes and even more lost their jobs and the banks covered it all up. When the truth was finally discovered, it was too late and the US Government saw no other way to limit and reverse the damages than to shell out billions in taxpayer money to the banks. This money was used to then pay out big bonuses and only one person ever went to jail. And the banks are still doing it today, just with different names.  The Big Short was very well-acted, entertaining, confusing, upsetting, but seeing it once was enough for me. I might catch it on TV someday, but it won't be making it to my home collected, hence the 3.0 star rating.Noble effort comes up a bit, well, short The Big Short (TBS) is a moderately below-average film that stumbles in a couple basic areas. I found myself in the metaphorical shoes of stock analyst Michael Baum (Steve Carrell) who cannot believe he is watching a slow-motion train wreck no one else either understands or cares a whit about. I'm unsure many early glowing reviewers actually watched the film. One giveaway: TBS is saturated with irony mustier than an underground cavern, yet few deemed it worthy of comment. From the one-eyed hedge fund manager Michael Burry (Christian Bale) who sees what others cannot, to the compromised ratings agency woman whose vision is (literally) impaired, it's nearly endless. The alligator lurking in the backyard pool at the abandoned Florida development? Wait, is that a metaphor? There's meta-irony mixed in with their praise: TBS is largely about people who willfully overrated mortgage bonds and thereby misled others for personal gain. I wonder if some purposely overrated TBS for analogous reasons. Full disclosure: I've worked on Wall Street for 25 years, both as a humble accountant and an opinionated research analyst. I've seen virtually all major Wall-Street-related films of the past 25-30 years, most more than once. Like the old joke about "Caddyshack" and its sequel, "Wall Street" far and away is the best of the genre, and "Wall Street II" the worst. I admire Michael Lewis, and I read TBS at least twice. The director's main conceit, that people can't enjoy a movie about a financial scandal without regular distractions including naked lovelies taking bubble baths, celebrity chefs, and comely actresses playing themselves in cameos, was a BIG disappointment. Underestimating the audience downgraded the similarly stylish and well-cast "Margin Call," in my view, terminally afraid to explain exactly why the fictional bank was going belly-up. Examples abound where a film both informs about the world of finance and entertains without annoying asides and sophomoric time-outs: "Wall Street" let us in on the world of mergers and acquisitions, risk arbitrage, and insider trading, "Boiler Room" limned the high-pressure sales tactics of unscrupulous brokers who operate in, well, boiler rooms. "Wolf of Wall Street" channeled "Boiler Room", "Goodfellas", and a sand grain of "Wall Street" to illuminate the dangers of charismatic pied pipers pitching penny stocks to suckers. Plus it made much better use of Margot Robbie (Margot Robbie). Instead of drowning the audience in complex terminology like Credit Derivative Obligations (CDOs) and Credit Default Swaps (CDSs), why not just stick with "mortgage bonds" (MBs) and "put options?" TBS cries out for the technique Rob Lowe suggests in "Thank you for Smoking": just add a line of dialogue to quickly explain what a soon-to-be-forgotten financial product is used for. Then move on. Movies like "Wall Street" and books like "The Great Crash 1929" place financial bubbles squarely in the context of human nature: People will rampantly speculate on the value of stocks and/or real estate, their values will eventually inflate, and then ultimately the bubble will pop. Stocks. Real estate. Inflate. Pop. Rinse and repeat. I suppose TBS is about bonds and real estate. Whatever, it's not that new. Roughly 90% of every financial crisis boils down to one thing: Money is borrowed that won't be repaid. 1929 crash. 1980s S&amp;L crisis. 2007 sub-prime mortgages. Follow the borrower. The other 10% is the colorful detail movies are made of. In 2016, it'll be shale petroleum-based loans and junk bonds that blow up. Yawn. The cast is first-rate and production values uniformly high. Ryan Gosling was very good as Jared Vennett, the unicorn who both works for an I-bank yet comprehends the inherently unsustainable underpinnings of the MBs they create. His Jenga scene explaining how MBs are constructed was my favorite. Some scenes utterly lack accuracy. Burry visits Goldman Sachs to ask them to craft a brand-new, never-before-devised contract to make a huge bet against the US housing market. Two spiffy junior bankers across the table (whom I'll nickname Muffy and Sanjay) quickly agree to write the unique contract then and there. Umm, no way, Sanjay. Brand new derivatives with novel risks that require bank capital to be set aside might take several weeks to put together. Muffy and Sanjay need to successfully navigate at least a couple of Risk Committee approval processes, plus invest serious time with internal lawyers and an external regulatory agency for good measure. Ouch. Other times I confess no clue what the film wants to convey. The scene with two young Coloradans (TYCs) in the lobby of JP Morgan Chase is one example. If I understand, the TYCs first get summarily rejected, then stumble upon a pitch book left on a lobby bench (?) that outlines the entire short-the-sub-prime-market thesis. Then one TYC looks directly into the camera and informs us this scene never actually happened; they simply cadged the impending sub-prime crisis idea from a friend. Huh? I'm confused. You either take artistic license or you don't, but not both. There went the "Best Editing" Oscar. Most financial flicks are chock-full of memorable quotes. "Wall Street" alone could fill a small Kindle ("Greed is good", "Lock and load," "Blue Horseshoe loves Annacott Steel," "So the falcon has heard the falconer?" "American Express has got a hit-man looking for me," "The illusion has become real," "Because it's wreckable"). "Boiler Room" actually includes a worshipful paean to "Wall Street"'s quotability. There's nothing similarly memorable in TBS. In a screenplay cut from prime Michael Lewis-woven cloth, this in itself constitutes a financial-bubble-sized scandal. Final irony: By placing full blame upon the banks, the filmmakers actually may delude viewers about the risks of history repeating itself and the public's ultimate responsibility for their financial matters. They thereby render a recurrence of this sad chapter in our recent economic history more likely. A second bubble bath scene, with Barney Frank explaining his indispensable role in this whole mess, would be a teaching moment like none other.Good for Understanding OK, this bored me to tears. Did folks not know the crash was due to companies 'propping' the market? Anybody buy a house and offered twice as much as they wanted? I was. I told them I live within my means and bought a home accordingly. It is the story of 3 levels of folks who figure out the market early,later, and latest from my view. Not interesting. How did they do this? I read the news and know how they did this, the mortgage folks that is. A lot of over characterizations based on one person representation such as the scenes about the rating agency. This is a film for those not clueful about this and those who are woefully uninformed. I was bored. I did not find Bael's performance was interesting or enlightening in any way. Why is a geek investor noting the numbers interesting?On the spot from the first minute until the credits. I had no expectations for this movie, but I was enjoying every minute. Educational, funny and exiting, this movie is a 9.5. The best thing about this movie is that is shows how the economy is so f...ed up, in real life. The cast for this movie is spot on. Every one of the four main characters are casted perfect for the role. Bale and Bitt are lovely to watch as two awkward but genuine guys, and Carell and Gosling also make a perfect match in this movie. Carrel is delivering his best movie performance ever (along with Foxcatcher)! The story is very good, and during the movie you learn a lot of things about the economy and how its all put together, to confuse the average citizen. Watch this movie and you will have a good time and learn something in the same time. And... you will also, I hope, think about the mechanics of the economy before you put your signature on something in the future.The Vidiot Reviews... The Big Short The best part of homeownership in the early-2000s was if your house ever burnt down, you still had two left over. While no one saw this as a problem, the suits in this dramedy didand made millions. When rogue hedge fund manager Michael Burry (Christian Bale) uncovers what will eventually become the housing bubble, he predicts its eventual collapse and, despite ridicule from every bank he meets with, he bets against it. His credit default swap scheme ends up intriguing a trader (Ryan Gosling), an investor (Finn Wittrock), another hedge fund manager (Steve Carell) and an ex-banker (Brad Pitt), all of who want in. Clarifying the complexities of the financial crisis and defining the convoluted terminology involved with elucidatory side vignettes, this layperson adaptation of the non-fiction novel is frightening, facetious, and keenly insightful. Incidentally, with all those subsequent foreclosures, smart traders would've invested in cans of squatter spray.  Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.caWhen the bubble bursts... "When the bubble bursts..." What just happened to Hollywood? They finally got their strength to shout out the bitter truth about our society. Stories that were condemned as anti-capitalistic are now the new hot stuff. I was disappointed with last year's output of Hollywood. After Fury Road and Star Wars, there wasn't much for cheer, until the Oscar season came. Trumbo, Bridge of Spies and The Big Short are three movies that ventured to explore the ideas beyond blind loyalty to conventional political scenario. While Trumbo and Bridge of spies dealt with the past, The Big Short was a depressing analysis of 2008's financial meltdown of the united states construction industry. The funny part is, even with a steaming subject and a detailed, disturbing analysis, this movie is credited as a comedy! Ah, the way world works... While most of the terms discussed in this movie are strictly technical, like CDO, sub-prime, etc., I succeeded to grasp what was going on and it was a head-twister. Basically, it was the shortcut plan of the wall- street money makers to keep the capitalistic wheel running. When there wasn't enough oil to turn the wheel, it crashed. That is, people failed to pay their mortgages back and as they accumulated beyond the limit, the stocks got low and the wall-street crashed. Four individuals came to know about this years before it happened and The Big Short follows through their and their attempts to capitalize the fall. There are no good guys in this stories. Likewise, we can't blame them for doing so, because the fall was inevitable. This haplessness makes this movie quite realistic and relatable. It's a big surprise that Adam Macky directed this film. It was quite a translation from Anchormen to The Big Short. The cast was so alive. Christian Bale, Steve Carrel, Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling and many other relatively unknown yet brilliant actors make this movie a delightful yet insightful watch. After all said and done, The Big Short brings out many questions that will elude sleep for many. Still, I have no idea how could they label this movie as a comedy. Seriously...Occasionally panders but makes its subject matter interesting and even, to an extent, engaging. 'The Big Short (2015)' takes a unique approach when trying to communicate its complex jargon and ideas - that being that it slots in celebrity cameos wherein the star straight-up tells you the definition of a specific term in the simplest way possible - and what that does is dilute the density of the piece without necessarily dumbing it down. This can occasionally seem like pandering, though, despite that it fits into the flick's overall fast-paced, free-flowing and fourth-wall nudging aesthetic. The picture commendably manages to make the somewhat dry source-material, or rather subject-matter, interesting and even, to an extent, engaging. It focuses on a set of characters that seem realistic and rounded enough to warrant our empathy when they're given the screen time to earn it. The film does become a little too unfocused and slightly cold in the long run, which prevents it from being any more investing than it is. 7/10Doesn't Tell The Whole Story But Worth A Watch For those who lived through it, we all knew how this ended so the story really is the why did it hsppen? And there is plenty of explanation here. Except the government is almost totally left out of the story. I read somewhere Clinton's deregulation in the '90s led to the subprime crisis in 2007/08. Anyhow, well worth a watch especially for those who didn't live through it.Mildly amusing semi-documentary marred by leftist Hollywood preaching (spoiler alert) They did a pretty good job of turning a semi-documentary into a mildly entertaining movie by using "cool" characters (I gave it a "4" out of 10). (Possible spoiler ahead): What nearly ruined it for me was when they dropped the claim in at the end that the rich people in banking and politics turned around and blamed the 2008 crash on "immigrants and poor people", which is an untrue fabrication.  The current uproar is not about legal immigration, it's about illegal aliens and enforcing existing immigration law. The movie inserts a blatant leftist take on a hot button issue which has little to do with the topic of this movie, and many Americans like me will strongly disagree with.  Made me sort of regret I'd given Hollywood twenty bucks to see it. I've cut back on what I'm willing to pay to see, because of all the actors speaking out on politics in an obnoxious fashion. They're free to do that, but I don't have to pay to go see them either!Steve Carell as I've never seen him before What everyone else said: brilliant movie, educational, entertaining, etc. But the eye-opener for me was Steve Carell. My respect for him as an actor skyrocketed after this movie. Maybe I've been missing something, but I've never seen him in a serious role before. When watching this movie, I immediately latched on to Mark Baum as someone to whom I should be paying attention. I later found out that he was played by Carell and I had a tough time reconciling that. I think Steve Carell has many great dramatic roles in his future and I am very pleased with that because I'm not a huge fan of his comedy. I like his comedy well enough, but his dramatic chops are several steps above. I said what I came to say in the previous paragraph; this paragraph is just an attempt to make IMDb's minimum length requirement.brilliant idea but I didn't want to pay money for an economic class the movie in general deserve 6 out ten for the magnificence acting not else the whole movie me and the crowd waiting to understand the concept of banking and money without any clue about what happening , something to difficult to understand even when the try to make it simple . about the idea of where our money is go it is brilliant , the movie start and end with the same flow without any idea about what going on the direction is OK , nothing will take your eyes same as the soundtrack or the music in the movie if it found the only good thing in the movie is the actor , very famous names and to be honest the all did very good , the play the rule in magnificence aspect { so real } as a conclusion i don't recommend to watch the movie as you will feel so stupid trying to understand economic not in a good way , after all we are not professional in banking if you would try to watch just to enjoy acting not elseEntertaining and educational First let me say that this movie was hardly a comedy for me- i didn't laugh even once. Though the atmosphere is light and playful, the subject is very serious. Adam McKay did great to adapt the novel and direct this film- it has great phase, explains the complex banking terminology and the events as they unfold. Yes, the events unfold 4 years- Michael Burry caught eye of the oncoming catastrophe 3 years before the actual collapse (which tells you enough about the government oversight, banking employees competence and rating agencies honesty). One guy with a computer and a M.D. did better to foresee the future of the US than all of the above - outrageous is too soft of a word to describe. As many others said - this is a must see educational experience! The whole cast did great to portray the characters involved- they are all profit driven individuals, but to blame them for capitalizing on others financial incompetence is hardly fair- they even tried to warn the people (motives for which are questionable), but got turned away by the "serious" media outlets. What else were they supposed to do- post their prediction on the Huffington Post?? Great movie experience through and through.Wolf wannabe. I don't get it.......and I don't mean the banking lingo! Having seen this movie I overheard the reviews calling it hilarious and I thought they must be talking about another movie. I found not a single part of this movie amusing even thinking back on it in a comedic light.  To me this movie was just an awkward cousin desperately trying to live up to the success of The Wolf of Wall Street (the bath description scene just makes this even more obvious) If you are interested in the world of finance then I'm sure there are qualities that will be informative but apart from that I don't understand who the focus audience of this movie is, apart from simply trying to pull in fans of the listed stars.  Definitely give this one a miss unless you are looking for a lesson in economics with no benefit at the end.Interesting and well done There is a lot of technical information that the audience needs know to appreciate the story and the movie uses many different devices to get us up to speed, from ordinary graphics, to the characters directly addressing the audience, to elaborate skits explaining some of the more obscure financial terms. It is inventive, funny and works well. There are two very eccentric characters and Christian Bale and Steve Carell do an amazing job portraying them. In fact, all the acting is realistic and intense. The only problem was, even though I enjoyed how stylish and well made the movie is, I was never sure what it was about. It was not about the financial meltdown and yet it was also not really about the characters that went up against wall Street and won. You saw them in action and it was fun watching them do their thing but you never got to know them. You never get emotionally involved. They should have ditched the Brown- Hedge Fund story and devoted that time to the other side, showing what was happening at the investment banks and how that culture was driving the process, like in "Liar's Poker". That way you could see the battle from both sides and appreciate what they achieved a little more. An interesting and entertaining movie done in an ultra modern style and I enjoyed it, but as a story it isn't all there.One of the worst movies I have ever seen I had mixed feelings before watching this movie - many people were saying this is one of year's best, but it's also on a such of specific matter-the financial crisis in the middle of the last decade. I don't want to go into details regarding the movie, but it was done in such a manner and in such a language (it's supposed to be in English :)), that for a person who is not personally involved in the financial world and terms, it is completely not understandable. After watching it, I was thinking: I lost 2 hours of my life watching a movie (not for the first time), but after these 2 hours I have nothing to show for - I didn't understand anything of it (maybe for the first time). OK, I said even if it's not my kind of movie, I should at least know what is going on in it! Well no-it was done in such a way, that I am pretty sure, even the actors in it didn't know what they are talking about. And these are some great actors-Brad Pitt, Steve Carell, Christian Bale... They played good, but they had no clue, what's going on! Even if the original idea was good-to make a movie about this, it was done in completely the wrong way! The Globes nominated it for best picture comedy (and what's horrifying me, it's probably gonna win), but let's be honest-there is not a single funny moment in this movie. I have never watched my watch so many times in the course of 2h. In my opinion this was one of the worst and most boring movies of 2015!!! This is a proof how you can waste such a talent - and the talent gathered in The Big Short (very short) was great.The movie no one cares for, the film everyone needs to see. The movie puts in perspective the criminality that takes place within the one percent. Puts it into terms the lay person could understand so they can understand the corruption taking place. The whole time you are telling yourself ( what is this ) ( no way ) a hard pill to swallow as a working class. The acting is exactly what you expect from the actors in it. The film overall was a B+. From the director behalf I felt there were some cuts that didn't make sense to me and made me feel like something was left out. Although this is a movie that everyone should see it sad to know that it won't get its message across to the audience that needs it.Wall Street still won't take the blame; movie shows why the should Five stars for this comedy-drama based on the best-selling Michael Lewis book about the 2008 financial crisis and the lonely voices in the wilderness calling, "Housing bubble," "Housing bubble," "This will end baaaadleeee." The idea that mortgage-backed securities could be anything other than rock solid so went against conventional wisdom that no one listened. But, as we know now, these securities had become more and more vulnerable as riskier loans were bundled into them, and the chaff soon outweighed the wheat. It takes a bit of understanding about how this financial market operated to grasp the significance of the action. Director Adam McKay, who wrote the screenplay with Lewis and Charles Randolph, cleverly provides the necessary background, having characters break the fourth wall to speak directly to the audience. For example, from her symbolic bubble bath and sipping champagne, actress Margot Robbie tells us what a financial bubble actually means. It's " a terrifically enjoyable movie that leaves you in a state of rage, nausea and despair," says A.O. Scott in his New York Times review, which includes a clip from McKay on some of the clever ways the film explains the financial goings-on. The cast does an exemplary job of embuing characters with strong personalities. Christian Bale plays Dr. Michael Burry, a loner physician-turned-hedge-fund-manager who figures out the problem early (and whose character confirms my aversion to heavy metal music). He takes the unprecedented step of actually looking at the individual mortgages bundled into the securities being offered and sees that many of them are weak and involve adjustable rate loans. When their interest rates go up, the homeowners will default. This, to him is an investment opportunity; he'll bet against the mortgage market. The banks are happy to back his scheme (involving credit default swaps), seeing it as a sure-fire winner for them. One of the banks he approaches has on staff a skeptical analyst, played by Ryan Gosling, who believes the good doctor may just be right. He convinces the unconventional trading firm led by Mark Baum (Steve Carell) to invest in the swaps, too. In one of the movie's funniest sequences, Baum sends staff to Florida to investigate some of these mortgages. They find unbuilt houses, a forest of "for sale" signs, and two beach-bum mortgage brokers (Max Greenfield and Billy Magnussen) , who don't hesitate to say they will insure basically anything. "Why are they confessing?" Baum whispers to his staffer. "They're not confessing. They're bragging," he replies. Similarly, Melissa Leo, as an official at an investment rating agency, is badgered into explaining how, if her firm rated investments accurately, the banks would just take their business down the street. In a Colorado garage, another pair of youthful investors (played by John Magaro and Finn Wittrock) wants to parlay $30 million into a bigger fortune. They set out to New York to figure out how. There they stumble onto the real estate problem and see the credit default swaps as their big chance, but they need connections, and they get help from their neighbor back home, a disenchanted former investment banker (Brad Pitt). It's telling that the few people who foresaw and took advantage of the inevitable crisis were all, one way or another, Wall Street outsiders. They weren't unaware that their gains were made on the backs of everyday Americans who lost billions in housing value, jobs and homes, pension fund value, and savings. Meanwhile, the many individuals and institutions whose carelessness, greed, or criminality created the bubble in the first place have not been called to account. No less an expert than Paul Krugman has written, "I think (the movie) does a terrific job of making Wall Street skulduggery entertaining, of exploiting the inherent black humor of how it went down." And, even more important, he says it "got the underlying economic, financial, and political story right." And it's still a story lots of people don't want Americans to hear.Go Long The Big Short is a movie based on a book by Michael Lewis who has brought us such stories as Liar's Poker and Moneyball and who bluntly is a national treasure. Nobody seems to be able to explain complex ideas about Wall Street as well as he does and the movie adaptation does a fantastic job explaining how various bond instruments work and how people ended up buying junk which was rated AAA. As someone who has worked on Wall Street (and Broad and Midtown and Boca Raton ) I have a good foundation of what happened and even I found myself learning something and having complex things explained in such a way as an aha moment clicked in. Now I don't want to make this sound like a dreary documentary. This is more The Wolf of Wall Street than a Ken Burns documentary. The film follows some of the people who realizing that there was a housing bubble and deciding to try to short the market. The Big Short emphasizes that even if they were right (and they were) they still could lose everything by getting the timing wrong or simply by having the investment banks refuse to price the instruments accurately. This brilliantly creates a true tension where the film could have simply been a disaster film with the audience screaming at the screen don't invest in that house. The Big Short sometimes is too on the nose for its own good. (=As an example having the spokeslady for the rating agencies wearing giant glaucoma glasses is a sledgehammer where none was needed. But the film quickly redeems itself with some wonderful fourth wall breaking where one of our heroes explains they did not find the answer in a pile of discarded prospectuses in an investment bank waiting room but actually by doing research but that we need a Raider's of the Lost Ark type discovery because movie.  A great film that entertains first. I cannot recommend enough. Also, I learned never order the fish stew on Sunday.The best movie detailing the engineered financial collapse during Bush II The movie wasn't entirely accurate some average people did know that subprime mortgages, balloon mortgages (5 year balloons which proves this happened entirely on Bush II's watch), etc. were a ticking time bomb. I was one of them, in 2005 when I invested in the mortgage business specifically in an outfit called American Home Mortgage, I only invested in them because they did not engage in subprimes or other risky loan practices, but guess what while on vacation in Orlando with my family, summer 2007, I saw my position and my kids positions in American Home Mortgage disappear via a Treo phone. American Home Mortgage was the 10th largest mortgage company in the country and it was the first to go! Anyone with half a brain saw the bubble but virtually everyone I knew, including my fat redneck boss, hung on every word spoken by Alan Greenspan and Alan was telling everyone to stay the course and all was well. This movie shows the criminal dealings of Goldman Sachs but they got bailed out and no one went to jail. This will happen again! This country is nothing more than a criminal enterprise! Kudos to Iceland for jailing the banksters and helping out the homeowners! By the way words right out of the idiots mouth: "We can put light where there's darkness, and hope where there's despondency in this country. And part of it is working together as a nation to encourage folks to own their own home." - President George W. Bush, Oct. 15, 2002... Bush gave the green light, through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to risky lending practices, and that's a freaking fact!Fantastic, and Important, Movie I know a lot of people take issue with Hollywood, but without them, common, everyday, people like me would never see a movie like this that explains how so many where robbed and stolen from in America. Normal people simply do not have the insight, or time, to follow what's going on in places like Wall Street. This is why it's important for our government to oversee and audit activities happening in places that can affect everyone. Elizabeth Warren is a HERO for taking on Wall Street. We need more people like her. This movie tells a story of greed. A story of how a few felt it was more important to become rich than think about the security and safety of thousands. America should never again turn a blind eye to such activity. We should learn from our mistakes and put in place laws and security measures to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. To do this, we need to remove money from politics so politicians we elect can do what they are elected to do: protect the people that elected them. This is a fantastic, and important, movie. Everyone should watch this.One of the BEST Films of 2015! Just finished The Big Short- blows Spotlight out of the water! I loved it. The first 10 minutes made me think it was trying to ripoff The Wolf of Wall Street and GoodFellas with "gangsta tawk" voice- overs and camera stills, but trust me- this is not a distraction once the story gets going. While Spotlight focuses on the topic of scandalous Priests and the Catholic Church, The Big Short focuses on the housing market crash and corporate greed. In terms of topics alone, Big Short feels more important. I'm not downgrading the former movie's subject matter and dismissing it entirely. I'm simply stating Big Short already has a theme voters will relate to more. Now let's get to the rest. First of all, Kudos to Adam McKay- this is a splendidly vibrant and compelling movie, and his direction is quick and alive. I think he's a VERY strong contender for Best Director, not only in the nomination department- but also the win. We'll see what DGA says, but right now he's in my predictions.  The acting was stronger then the ensemble work in Spolight, the former movie having a solid cast but no one seemed to really come to life save Tucci and Ruffalo. Where as here, EVERYBODY is electrifying. Christian Bale and Steve Carell are the standouts, and Bale def deserves a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Carell also - WOW- just didn't expect him to be this good after being slightly underwhelmed with his work last year in Foxcatcher. But he's brilliant in this- and both him and Bale are also very funny! I also enjoyed Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Finn Wittrock, Jeremy Strong, John Magaro and Marisa Tomei (the latter being a relief to see playing a wife who's actually the proper age; if this movie had been directed by David O. Russell, ten points for guessing who he would have cast).  The screenplay is also fresh and informative. Even if you're someone like me who doesn't understand all the fundamentals or backdrops for what caused the housing market crash or how banks operate, this movie breaks it down so it's a little more clear- and in fun, innovative ways including a cameo by Selena Gomez playing blackjack in Las Vegas.  I know Spotlight is still the favorite, but with a year so open and full of surprises- looking for an alternative to go against it might be The Big Short and not the sci-fi threesome (which may be a two pair or just a loner by Oscar Nomination morning). The Golden Globes are on January 10th- and if any movie is beating The Martian for the Comedy Globe, this is your horse to bet on. The SAG Ensemble award also could be going to The Big Short cast, which in my eyes did a hell of a better job then Spotlight's must quieter groupMust see Awesome movie. It's been a while that a wall street movie gets a 10 stars out of me. Not even The Wolf of Wall Street with my favorite actor Leonardo DiCaprio made such a strong impression on me. When it started I doubted that Carrel would deliver, for me he will always be connected to comedy, must be because I am such huge fan of The Office and have watched it thousand times. But he is awesome. The acting is great, the story is interesting. But what really brings the movie to a 10 stars review is that is educational, which adds social value to it. I would even show it to a class and make them write a paper on it. Excellent movie! Will definitely watch it a few times more in the future.Everyone hates poetry Great drama moves you. It excites you. Scares you. Makes you sing. Makes you cry. The Big Short makes you shake your fist. The Big Short is driven as much by its Iago as it is its Othello, and deservedly so. The events in the story did happen. Many people still don't care. The Big Short gives you reason to care. That is what separates this film from being merely a documentary and turns it into high drama.  No matter your politics - mark this, like Citizen Kane, as a movie that should be seen at least once. It is not always comfortable to watch. And that is a good thing - The Big Short is a documentary of a real life horror that unfolds in slow motion, and reminds us that even after the fact - no one is listening. Because truth is like poetry.Best movie to expose and explain how the real estate bubble occurred great movie!! A+ As a former Realtor I took pride and selling homes and loans as the market Went up, few of us predicted the collapse no one could pf predicted betting against mortgages, wish I was one of the few that invested, Anyhow I love this movie, and how detailed it went to teach the common person with little knowledge of the how the market crashed, I love how the movie was directed and produced, the cast did a great job, I wouldn't change anything except, big players from Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Merrill lynch, aig bedded again the mortgages, it should of been exposed more, also it should of depicted the role of Alan greenspam and exposed him for the crook him and his partners were, how the clueless president we had and still do, we the people had to pay for their mistakes, can you believe that no one went to jail for this horrific crimes, 1 + million families lost their home during this mortgage frauds I recommend everyone to see this movie!! And take control of our economy Rated this film 9/10 great filmEvery American needs to watch this... and get mad. Wow. Just wow. I thought I knew enough about the crash of '08 but this film explains every angle and tells you all about the background shade leading to the robbery of the American Dream for most Americans. I knew about people buying house they couldn't afford, I knew about the garbage bonds and rigging of the etc, etc, etc. But OMG, the whole system is dirty. These people shouldn't be allowed to see the light of day if you ask me but they're living large and playing your average American into slavery. Bankers, Wallstreet 'ladies of the night' and the lot of them. The system isn't broken.. it is just working against your average American. And this movie gives you a much needed peak into the circus.Boom! A truly great film about the corruption in the financial sector. I enjoyed every minute of it and also it was very close to home. I used to set these things up on back office trading systems after they were dealt. I began to notice that we were moving away from ordinary bonds to MBA's - (Mortgage Back Assets) and after a while we moved onto CDO's (Collateral Debt Obligations). What I could never understand - but personally found reassuring - was why the always had such high ratings. I didn't want my bank to take any undue risks and go bust because my job depended on it. In around 2006 I read the 'Economist' and there was a mention about these subprime mortgages. I felt uneasy so I sent them a mail asking why mortgage backed bonds in general had such good ratings... No reply. Anyway I lost my job with them around July 2006 when my job went out to India as I was told they needed to cut costs (It later transpired that the cost of providing two direct connections between the trading floor and the Indian back office cost more than keeping the team in London). However I was treated fairly and got a decent redundancy package and soon found a new job. 2008 - kerpow! my ex employer took a huge hit and a year later had to transfer Euro 85bn of problem assets off its balance sheet. It now no longer exists - a once proud bank. Total losses (so far) which had to be covered 23 billion dollars.  Numerous trading scandals were unearthed and a new scandal is just being investigated. With hindsight I'm glad I lost my job to get out of the mayhem - but 1000's of jobs were lost in London and Germany due to high level incompetence. There's another crash on the way as Donald is just stirring things up nicely.The Big Fish Must Hate This Movie Let me begin with saying that all cultures in history has its good guys and bad guys, and they either hi-jacked each others or invaded other regions to get a hold of its assets, precious metals and trade routes (by the way so little it had to do with personal grudges and egocentrism or even giving some kings / suzerains the wall) or they built safe roads for the merchants and the camel trains and declared wars against the unjust rulers who had been crushing their rayah / subjects by taxes that no one'd be able to get through (look, for instance, at Ottoman State and its wars or Seldjukids and their Caravanserai structure.) Today none of these happens. And however these morally unstable world operates and the "good" guys canalize / put the clamps on it is perfectly shown by Adam McKay who is genius enough to turn the movie which should be "boring as hell" with economic blah blahs into a playground for a bunch of great actors some of whom has gestures and facial expressions that we all like along the road; and he made the evil seen out in the open. A special thank you, Michael Lewis. :) The art department did its job. (The shifting of the scenes one after another! That was great! Also their "on purpose" sloppiness! Wow!) What we learned from this movie is that we should (and sometimes can) care for the people of low and middle classes, and the immigrants, the minorities, and taxpayers of all classes... But we seriously won't... Booyah. Amen!..excellent movie This is an eye opener to every people out there who doesn't care about the world's economy! Everyone should watch this movie!!! This is our guide, this is reality, this is what's happening. I'll be planning to read the book as well so I can dig in and understand some points that a normal person like me doesn't know. It's my first time writing a movie review, and this movie just got into my nerves! I have no idea I might end up writing here! LoL it was just so good! I just saw Ryan Gosling's name so I decided to watch ha-ha! and then there's Christian Bayle! of course Brad Pitt, It's like what the hell is this movie and they're all here? So I tried to look and I was stunned like what am I watching ?? what is this ??? The stars really did a great job in this movie!! So yea Congratulations to everyone!There is no other way that I know of to clearly explain CDO's and MBS's (SLIGHT spoiler alert) Both the CDO and the MBS are non-tangible, complex assets. How complex are they? Watch this movie to find out. These very "creatures" nearly took the stars and stripes off of Ol' Glory. Combine the greed of several thousand money-hungry loan officers, pile on bankers and bond traders that find out they cannot produce enough crappy debt (read: subprime mortgages) to keep the machine wheels spinning freely enough, and viola! You have a perfect storm. I am NOT a Brad Pitt fan, however, he puts in a solid performance. Steven Carrell (sp) is one of my favorites because he brings it. He brought it in The Office (TV), Brad Almighty, Foxcatcher, and now - The Big Short. He carried the movie well. As in all books that I have ever read, the movie is a bit clip of the book, however, it was 2 hours and 2 minutes WELL spent and there was nary an empty seat in the theatre on a Saturday over a holiday weekend. Very highly recommended.one of the worst movies i've ever seen i thought that the reason to watch a movie was to care about the characters, but this had no characters to care about. The direction was great, in terms of the ideas shown in the movie, but it was f-ing awful. I liked the asides to the camera, but the shots of moving images was dizzying. As a person who is not into wall street and trading, i didn't understand half of the film. Sorry, but this ranks as a complete waste of time in my books. The actors were great, but I didn't care about any of them. Nice to see Brad Pitt again, but no one made me care about their story. I guess if you understand wall street and it's lingo you would care more about this movie. This is my first review on IMDb and the movie so infuriated me that I felt I must write a review to express how deeply I hated it.
Legal/historical drama, not action Don't be fooled by the title. Make sure you know what you're getting yourself into when you watch this film. Bridge of Spies is literally about the Cold War Bridge of Spies, where Soviet/US spies were exchanged through negotiations. This is nothing like "The Americans" (FX TV drama - for some high unrealistic and over-sexualized espionage action - redirect here) and the most action-packed scene you will see is Francis Gary Powers getting shot out of his U2 plane during his mission.  Bridge of Spies is really a historical/legal drama. And based on my preliminary research, they seem to be getting most of their facts right. Obviously a little bit embellished for Hollywood's sake, Bridge of Spies does a fine job as a historical docudrama. There is a lot of talking, but it's meaningful talking. At times, the film can be a little slow {opening scene, especially}, but give it a chance and you might enjoy it. History buffs like myself will definitely enjoy it. But thrill-seekers, you're better off to see the new James Bond movie instead.A very good, very Spielberg motion picture, starring Tom Hanks. This movie hit me really strangely. I was expecting a political drama about the cold war, and while indeed it was that, I was not expecting to have so much fun and for Bridge of Spies to be so humorous.  The Coen brothers writing a movie Steven Spielberg would direct just sounds like a winning combination and it really was. Sealing the deal, was a great performance by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks does what he does best, by playing an everyday man in an average life. James Donovan was just an insurance lawyer who gets caught up in the middle of the Cold War. Bridge of Spies, starts him off so normal and then turns his life into quite an adventure. And I do mean adventure. In the hands of Spielberg, the movie's visuals were large and epic. I was expecting this movie to feel more like his last flick, Lincoln. Instead it feels more like Indiana Jones, as James Donovan travels to Berlin at the time when the wall was being completed.  Watching Hanks play Donovan who is just swept into an overwhelming situation and just keeps his cool and his charm is just highly enjoyable.  Totally loved Bridge of Spies, It's one of the best team ups between Hanks and Spielberg and even though Lincoln was a great movie, Bridge of Spies is everything Spielberg is capable of. So entertaining."And the Best Supporting Actor Oscar goes to... Mark Rylance" There are combinations of film makers that make you confident, as you pay your ticket price, that you are not going to be terribly disappointed: Steven Spielberg directing; Tom Hanks taking the lead; Janusz Kaminski behind the camera; Michael Kahn editing and a Coen brothers script (with Matt Charmon (Suite Française)). And Bridge of Spies doesn't disappoint, particularly for someone of my more advanced years (I was born the year following the film's climatic events) who remembers well the terror of potential nuclear catastrophe that hung over the world through the 60's and 70's. In a story based on true events, Hanks plays James Donovan (diverging somewhat from reality here) as an insurance lawyer dragged by his firm into defending Rudolf Abel, the accused Soviet spy played exquisitely by British stage acting legend Mark Rylance. Against this backdrop, the international blue touch paper is about to be lit by the shooting down over Russia of Gary Powers (Austin Stowell from "Whiplash") in his U-2 spy plane (sorry – "article"). Donovan becomes instrumental in unofficially negotiating on behalf of the US government the release of Powers in East Berlin. The deal is jeopardized by his boy-scout tendencies to also want to help another US captive Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers). I've read some negative reviews of this film in the papers that made me quite cross, describing it as "yawnsome" and "sanctimoniously dull". For me, nothing could be further from the truth and the packed Saturday night audience I saw this with seemed equally gripped from beginning to end, silent save for the odd laugh where some appropriate humor is weaved into the story. Tom Hanks is solid and believable as the fish-out-of-water lawyer, albeit that the role is played with a large spoonful of patriotic American sugar as Donovan trumpets about the importance of the constitution over the lynch-mob mentality of the general public. Alan Alda – great to see again on the big screen – channels his best Hawkeye-style exasperation as Donovan's boss, looking for a clean and quick conviction. But it is Mark Rylance – an irregular player in movies, and due to appear again in next year's "BFG" – who shines out as the acting star of the film. His salubrious and calm turn as the cornered spy just reeks of class and if he isn't nominated for a Best Supporting Actor nomination for this then there is no justice. (A special 'casting recognition award' to my wife Sue for spotting that the actress playing Judge Byer's wife – Le Clanché du Rand – was Meg Ryan's mother in Sleepless in Seattle 22 years ago!)  The cinematography is superb with some gorgeous tracking shots and framed scenes. Most outstanding of all is the scene depicting the traumatic construction of the Berlin wall – long tracking shots in greys and blues delivering a truly breathtaking piece of cinema. In general I'd give a big shout-out to both the art department and the special effects team in making the desolation of East Berlin feel so real. It makes the similar scenes, that I commented positively on in the recent "Man from U.N.C.L.E." seem like an amateur school production. The special effects team also contribute in making the shooting down of the U-2 a thrilling piece of cinema. Music is sparingly and effectively used by Thomas Newman, and it can be no greater complement to the composer than that I was wondering until the end titles as to whether it was another Spielberg/ John Williams collaboration or not. A great film, one of my favorites this year. Highly recommended, especially if you are over 50. You should also get out to a cinema to see this one – it will be far more effective on the big screen than the small one. (Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks.)An unshowy Steven Spielberg does a master's job with Cold War tensions, honoring a real-life attorney's victory over fear. A feel-good Cold War melodrama, Bridge of Spies is an absorbing true-life espionage tale very smoothly handled by old pros who know what they're doing. In its grown-up seriousness and basis in historical conflict, Steven Spielberg's first feature since Lincoln three years ago joins the list of the director's half-dozen previous "war" films, but in its honoring of an American civilian who pulled off a smooth prisoner exchange between the East and West during a very tense period, the film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does now. Spielberg's fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, which world- premiered at the New York Film Festival and opens commercially on October 16, looks to generate stout box-office returns for Disney through the autumn season. For people of Spielberg's generation, the early years of the nuclear era and the stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union represents a significant part of the fabric of childhood. With the passage of time, it's possible to tell stories of the time without furnishing them with overt propagandistic overlays, and for Westerners there is the added built-in appeal of the "we won" factor and the perception that dealing with adversaries was so much simpler then than it is now. As their focus in this impeccably rendered recreation of a moment in history, most palpably represented by the building of the Berlin Wall, Spielberg and screenwriters Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen have chosen a sort-of Atticus Finch of the north, a principled, American Everyman insurance attorney unexpectedly paged to represent a high-level Soviet spy caught in New York. There is no question that Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is guilty, but James B. Donovan (Hanks), a proper and decent family man with a professional dedication to his client and an abiding loyalty to the principles of the U.S. Constitution, has a quick and intuitive read of any legal situation and shrewdly stays at least one step ahead of the game in almost any situation.One of Spielberg's best most recent movies Bridge Of Spies is a historical drama film starring Tom Hanks, co-written by the Coen brothers, and directed by Steven Spielberg. Even though its subject matter of the Cold War is something I know very little about, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am now more interested than ever to learn more about it. I rank it among the best of Spielberg's most recent movies. In 1957, tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War are at their peak. Spies from both the American CIA and Soviet KGB are a major threat to the security of both world powers and each side often resorts to hasty measures to stop any classified information from being leaked. In Brooklyn, New York, Rudolf Abel is arrested under the suspicion of being a spy. James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is assigned as Abel's defence lawyer. However the idea of defending a potential Soviet spy proves to be an unpopular and difficult task for Donovan. Meanwhile, over in the Soviet Union, an American spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down and captured by the KGB. As a means to ease tension between the two warring countries, Donovan proposes a swap between the two prisoners of war, Abel for Powers. Despite containing barely any action scenes and being almost entirely made up of talking, the film never feels boring or slow paced. This is most likely due to the Coen brothers' clever screenplay and Steven Spielberg's creative direction. There were many suspenseful moments where it felt like the prisoner negotiations would go horribly wrong and that kept me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hanks also gives another memorable performance as James B. Donovan, once again proving his versatility as an actor. I rate it 8.5/10.Great Spy Thriller In 1957, during the Cold War, the insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is assigned by the Bar association to defend in court the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), who was captured by the FBI. Donovan is successful and Rudolf is sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death penalty. Meanwhile the American pilot and spy Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is arrested by the Soviet government while taking photos from a spy plane that crashed. The CIA summons Donovan to help in the negotiation to exchange the two spies. When Donovan learns that the American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) was arrested in the border of East Berlin while trying to bring his German girlfriend to the West Berlin, he decides to include the student in the negotiation. However his proposal is not supported by the CIA that is interested in Powers only. Further, Powers is prisoner of the soviet government and Pryor is prisoner of the GDR (German Democratic Republic). Will Donovan succeed in his intent? "Bridge of Spies" is a great spy thriller based on a true story in the period of the Cold War. The plot is engaging and the cinematography, costume design and art direction are amazing. It is unnecessary to comment the direction of Steven Spielberg and the performance of Tom Hanks, perfect as usual, but it is impressive the capacity of negotiation of James B. Donovan. This American lawyer is shown as an impressive negotiator, having cold blood to make tough decisions. The credits informs that Donovan has been also successful negotiating later in Cuba the release of prisoners. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Ponte dos Espiões" ("Bridge of Spies")Spielberg and Hanks--fry to find a better duo than that for a great film. "Everyone deserves a defense. Everyone matters." James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) In Bridge of Spies, Steven Spielberg once again masterfully goes to the historical drama with a righteous man's theme (think Schindler and Lincoln for starters). This time lawyer James B. Donovan is asked to defend an accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Able (Mark Rylance, superb), in order to show the world the American justice system is democratic.  The story is "inspired by true events" with the outline of the exchange of Able for U-2 downed pilot Gary Powers historically accurate. As usual, Spielberg recreates the times with the atmosphere, cars, and film noir aspect of a spy thriller in the figurative and literal Cold War. He said, "I always wanted to tell the stories that really interested me in my personal life—which are stories about things that actually happened." Hanks is central to Spielberg's vision of the lone hero defying the odds and supporting the highest ideals of the American Constitution and the individually virtuous man. Never does Hanks overplay the good-guy card; he's just very adept at playing an everyman not always right but always righteous.  The dialogue is crisp, a no fooling around typical of Spielberg and Hanks but a charming bad guy as well: James Donovan: "Aren't you worried?" Rudolf Abel: "Would it help?" As producer Kristie Macosko Krieger commented about Spielberg, "He's got a childlike sense of wonder. He never gets tired of hearing stories . . . . " Bridge of Spies is vintage Spielberg with a Lincoln-like atmosphere, righteous hero, and intriguing multi-plot, an entertaining spy story brimming with humanity.  As the director says, "This is more about very smart people in conversation with each other, and the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads is that, if they make the wrong decisions, it's the end of the world."Good acting can't save true-life lugubrious Cold War tale that lacks suspense What motivated Steven Spielberg to go ahead and take on a project such as "Bridge of Spies?" I've read that it was simply his nostalgia for the Cold War era, firmly ensconced in his childhood memories. Unfortunately, the vehicle to tell that story—the combined tale of the capture and trial of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel and swap for the downed US pilot Gary Powers on Russian soil—packs little punch due to its obvious lack of suspense. The "Bridge of Spies" narrative can be easily summarized in a short paragraph: the US government unofficially conscripts insurance lawyer James Donovan to defend Soviet spy Abel after he's captured by the Feds in Brooklyn. The trial is a foregone conclusion but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence Abel to prison instead of death since he could be used in a prisoner exchange in the future. Sure enough, after Gary Powers is shot down in his U2 spy plane, Donovan is again called upon to negotiate a prisoner swap with the Russians. A wrench is thrown into the negotiations when a US graduate student is arrested as a spy by the East Germans. Donovan deftly negotiates the swap of Abel for both Powers and the American student, and the exchange is facilitated with little incident. As historical incidents related to the Cold War go, the Abel-Powers narrative is hardly one of high drama. A major problem is that Donovan has no single, strong antagonist to play off of. The negotiations with his Soviet counterpart, a KGB agent masquerading as a diplomat, are a forgone conclusion. We know of course that the spy swap will be successful, so where is the suspense? The "heart-pounding" moment is hardly heart pounding at all—as Abel and Powers are about to exchange places, there is a slight delay before the East Germans deliver the American student to complete their part of the bargain. Yes of course I understand that Donovan dramatically threatened the East Germans, as they could have been blamed by the Russians for sabotaging the spy swap. But their decision was really a forgone conclusion too, as the East Germans were always under the yoke of the Russians, and were in no position to act independently (balking at giving up the student of course was their way of "saving face"). With all this lack of suspense, it was incumbent upon Mr. Spielberg's screenwriters (including "luminaries" Joel and Ethan Coen) to manufacture a series of fictional events to spice up a "thriller" that hardly thrills at all! Here a few examples: spectators at Abel's sentencing did not loudly object to the no death penalty sentence; Donovan and family were not victims of a drive-by shooting; Donovan's coat was not stolen by a gang in East Berlin (in reality, Donovan merely observed a gang nearby) and Donovan never personally observed people being killed as they attempted to climb over the Berlin Wall. Spielberg's attempt to recreate the era is rife with numerous gaffes. Early on Donovan is seen riding in a in a NYC R-32 subway car that first went into service in 1964 (the scene is set in 1961). That wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that the interior of the car appears to be from the 70s and beyond, and not 1961. The gaffes, which include anachronisms, character error, continuity, errors in geography, factual errors, plot holes, revealing mistakes and miscellaneous errors are all detailed under the Bridge of Spies "Goofs" section on IMDb. "Bridge of Spies" is not a complete loss as the film features some excellent acting by Tom Hanks as Donovan and Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy Abel. With its 40 million dollar budget and decided lack of suspense, I wonder why the film was made in the first place. It of course gives Spielberg an opportunity to peddle a rather simplistic and obvious message: there were some bad people on the other side of the Iron Curtain (faceless soldiers shooting people trying to escape over the Berlin War) but also individuals such as master spy Abel, who end up displaying unexpected glimpses of humanity.Turkey Without The Gravy I am biased in my review of BRIDGE OF SPIES. The Cold War is my thing, always has been my thing. I am dazzled by that time in history: surveillance, the cars, CIA, Eisenhower, and the mystique of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.  From the trailer of this film, I expected a delicious plate of Cold War atmosphere, intrigue, and commentary. Like a gleeful child, I sprinted to the movie theatre – expecting a non-pretentious high octane version of Mad Men. I anticipated my favorite era in history being served up like LET ME IN (a piece of 1980s period perfection elegantly directed by Matt Reeves). I held close the trailer as I landed my perfect middle seat in the theatre. The clips of a U2 Surveillance jet spiraling at 70,000 feet, children overflowing in tears as they watch a thermonuclear film strip, and Tom Hanks' face plastered to a subway window as we see guards firing at bystanders trying to climb over the Berlin Wall.  Then you add Steven Spielberg to the mix – the master of the period piece – modern cinema - the evoker of our deepest emotions. One of my favorite Spielberg films is Munich. Munich captures the violence of the Middle East 70s with revere, respect, and revelation. This is what I wanted from Bridge Of Spies. I wanted a dark, harrowing portrait of the Cold War, I wanted this tense era exposed in Spielbergian fashion, and I wanted to have 1957-1961 ruminating in my heart, mind, and belly. Bridge of Spies, however, met none of my desired expectations.  Diluted by a PG-13 rating, filled with comedic moments (clearly due to the Coen Brothers having written or participated in this script) that don't tickle my fancy, and an avoidance of Cold War atmosphere – Bridge Of Spies hit me like a tennis ball on the head.  It's taught, adequately plotted, and the hero is smart, likable, and witty. It's garnered rave reviews. But, for anyone that likes substance, don't look here. Spielberg's story is a moral tale – of courage and standing up for one's ideals – the universal plot which Steven devours like a hungry child.  Unfortunately, there's no stakes. Hanks follows his journey and does what he does best – but his universe is given little context. You'll want turkey and you'll get turkey – but you're not getting any gravy.  **Possible Spoilers – Things that bugged me about the film was plethora of wasted opportunities. When you have Spielberg at the helm, you know what could have been –  1. The relationship between the Lawyer (Hanks) and the Soviet Captive (Mark Rylance) is an unbalanced paper weight. We get a glimpse into the Lawyer's character, the archetypal Tom Hanks - fair, honest, moral, etc. We get very little info on the Captive. He is quiet, dignified, and keeps responding to Hanks wondering if he is aware of his dire situation, "Would it help?" Rylance is the typical Spielbergian "caught in the middle guy" – much like Ben Kingsley in Schindler's List. Physically weak, trapped and powerless - yet stoic and unafraid. That being said, what are his motives? He is a spy but what drives him – where is the monologue where he explains his background, what formed and shaped him and what forms the basis of his lifelong goals? 2. What I love about Mad Men is its strong focus on the media and culture of the era. Except for the end of Bridge of Spies (where we get a clip of Pierre Salinger informing the news of the spy swap) and an early scene of a teenage girl watching a late night story, there's not much to nibble on – Spielberg wastes a huge opportunity in a class room scene where kids are watching a nuclear bomb film strip. Lifting the film strip like a YouTube Clip and then showing a few generic shots of kids watching it and one girl crying - the master of modern cinema stumbles and falls into shallow surf. In this instance, I wanted to yell at the editor – build this up, let it seep in, give us some Wonder Years or Let Me In flavor. There's none to be had –  3. Not only do we get a vapid Francis Gary Powers – due to lackluster character development and the miscasting (in my opinion), but the U2 Surveillance storyline is about 12 minutes. Give me at least 25, Steven!! When the U2 is shot out of the sky, we get about a minute of action – give us three. In addition, because Francis Gary Powers has no character development, I don't sympathize with him or even care if he comes home.  4. The PhD student who is included in the Prisoner Swap is devoid of character – another guy that I could care less if he makes it home. Both guys appeared to have a lackluster indifferent time over the in the USSR. The Soviets dowsed Powers with water and German soldiers rip up the PHD students thesis paper – oh no! 5. There is no discussion of the disastrous political implications of the U2 being shot down over the Soviet Union. Reluctant to authorize the mission, Eisenhower was smeared by its failure and left office of the President on a black cloud. However, we don't hear Eisenhower's name mentioned once in the story.  All and all, Spielberg delivers a cup of vanilla ice cream with fudge – most audiences are going to love Hanks and the Soviet spy.  In the final analysis, it's a buddy film with some period costumes and a somewhat poignant conclusion. That being said, those that want a stirring pot of fear, sadness, and elation – I suggest you wait for this on HBO and watch Munich instead.  Ted's Personal Enjoyment: C+interesting historical drama and a great performance "Bridge of Spies" from 2015 is about the Francis Gary Powers incident in the 1960s. As usual, with the exception of the Lincoln assassination, I remember it. This time, though, only vaguely. The U.S. arrested a Russian spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and chose James Donovan (Tom Hanks) who had some experience in military cases, to defend him. Abel is found guilty but Donovan is able to convince the Judge to commute his sentence to life in case the U.S. needs him later - for instance, if we should want to exchange him for one of our own. That situation happens when Francis Gary Powers, taking aerial photographs for the CIA, is shot down and taken prisoner. Donovan is then sent to negotiate the exchange. For many people, this will be a slow, talky drama, with one big action scene, Powers being shot down, and one scene of tension (if you don't know the outcome). It is, however, a very good drama with Hanks giving a strong and sometimes humorous performance as Donovan, thrust into the world of international spies and negotiations. He takes it upon himself to also work for the freedom of an American student, Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) who was arrested for being at the wrong place at the wrong time.  That student is the only person involved in the case who is alive today, at 83, and praised the film but thought they "took a lot of liberties with it." Well, that's Hollywood. The main reason, other than historical interest, to watch this film is the performance of Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel. A winner of three Tony awards, two Olivier awards, and a BAFTA, Rylance is a highly regarded stage actor, known as the best of his generation. He's made very few films but he's about to make more and take the film industry by storm. As Abel, Rylance creates a human being, portraying him as a quiet, unassuming older man sent to do a job. He bonds with Donovan, but he tells him that he's not afraid to die. He spends his time in prison drawing. It is a remarkable performance which has earned him an Oscar nomination. Strangely, many people involved in this incident didn't live too long after -- Abel, who returned to the Soviet Union and to his family, lectured for 10 years and died in 1971; Donovan died in 1970; and Powers died in a helicopter crash while working for a TV station in 1977. I hope the film will encourage some people to read up on this case - of course, I always hope that. Maybe some time somebody will do it rather than posting the question someone did about Gandhi -- was this a fictional character.Lukewarm Coldwar Drama by Spielberg with many painful grimaces by Hanks BRIDGE of SPIES, Spielberg // Starring Tom Hanks in Lukewarm Coldwar drama. Summary: Uninspired Spielberg Mountain from Molehill with pitiful Hanks in Pain throughout. Viewed at Colisée cinema, Marrakesh, Friday Dec. 4, 2015. By Alex Deleon. With so many intriguing Cold War subjects up for grabs one wonders what made Steven Spielberg choose this relatively minor Cold War incident as the subject matter of his latest directorial effort.  The background: In the summer of 1960 an American high altitude spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union and pilot Gary Powers who bailed out and survived was interned by the Russians. At about the same time a big time Russian spy with US citizenship was arrested and put on trail for treason in the USA. Idealistic New York attorney James Donovan (Hanks) defends him in court and is then recruited by the CIA to facilitate an exchange of this spy for captured U2 spy plane pilot Powers in Berlin. The exchange took place in divided Berlin on Feb. 20, 1962 at the height of the Kennedy administration six months prior to the Cuban Missiles crisis.  The foreground: The result: a big disappointment with a heavy handed script by the Coen Brothers and some very bad acting in a long tedious dragged out attempt to elevate this subject to the level of Greek tragedy with Tom Hanks pulling slightly different variations of a pained face in every scene he's in, which is most of the picture. Greek tragedy this is not, although we are compelled to feel a little sorry for Hanks when his steadfast defense of the American Constitution is met with hate, derision, and even death threats from his fellow Americans, and then he has to hide his dangerous spy exchange trip from his own family when he volunteers to go to Berlin on a thankless top secret mission to ease cold war tensions and save an American college student stranded in East Berlin into the bargain. En somme:to sum up -- From The combination Spielberg/Hanks and the setting in Berlin, a city I know so well, I expected much more. This turned out to be a routine, almost soppy Hanks performance and a very routine uninspired turn by Spielberg at the helm. First of all I remember the era of the film very well and it did not seem to me at the time to be nearly the momentous event it is built up to be in this film. If lawyer Donavan (Hanks) was in the news for a while it certainly wasn't a very big while, and the spy exchange at the bridge was merely seen as a minor event in much more momentous cold war Events of the time such as the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1962 and The Cuban missile crisis in October 1962. I remember thinking at the time that it was nice for our side to admit for once that We also Spy and thought that might be the ball Spielberg would run with. But the mawky family drama we are given, and the overall talkiness with little backup action, plus the building up of the the exchange on the Berlin bridge in freezing winter weather to an event of Superbowl proportions simply does not have the drama we are supposed to think it had. Overall, a dud that fails to go off in a stagy unrecognizable Berlin. Recommended only for die-hard Tom Hankniks who sympathize with Mr. next-door America, no matter what he does. As for the Cold War political background -- Google tells it much better. (Google, Gary Powers, U2 incident) Alex, Marrakesh. :carries a spirit of all-American-ism without being too preachy, keeping a wit about it and Tom Hanks One of the surprising things about Bridge of Spies is not really that Steven Spielberg directed this story, which tracks the trial and then trade of a Russian spy in 1957 (an exchange for an American pilot, and someone else who I'll get to shortly). It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script. It's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress). The Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance. In a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go. Bridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice ("Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now. Two little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax. Aside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.Burning Bridge with Boredom How Steven Spielberg went from the king of summer thrills to the most boring director in Hollywood is a problem that's perplexed me since I pried my eyes open through Lincoln. We all know the man can make a great movie. Most of us grew up on a diet of E.T., Jaws and Indiana Jones: spectacular event films with all the entertainment oomph of a theme park roller coaster. Then, Spielberg hit middle age and wanted to make important films for grown-ups. He made Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and Munich, but he also made Minority Report, A.I and War of the Worlds – pretty decent action films with big star power. It looked like Spielberg had come of age with a sharpened skill set and a slightly deeper world view, but the more high-brow Spielberg gets, the duller his movies become... Inspired by real life events, and apparently a footnote in a JFK biography, Bridge of Spies tells the story of an insurance attorney named James Donovan. A mild-mannered family man plucked from a Norman Rockwell painting, Donovan is as American as the flag itself – and it's a trait he waves at every opportunity, from gratuitous speeches about the American Constitution to his acceptance of a case he is destined to lose. In the opening act, we watch an older man (Mark Rylance) take his easel on the subway, sit in the park and paint, and very carefully remove a fake nickel from the underside of a park bench. The nickel is hollow, and written on a tiny piece of paper within, is a series of codes. The man's name is Rudolf Abel, and he's arrested for treason and espionage just a few moments later. Given the year is 1957, Abel's fate looks bleak. The Rosenbergs were executed just four years earlier after being convicted of similar charges, and Abel refuses to cooperate with the CIA, making him delectably disposable. These days, he'd probably just disappear, but back then, America still believed its own propaganda and the notion of due process. It must appear as if Abel is getting a fair and just trial, which is where James Donovan comes in... It feels a little like a greatest hits album, but the scenes with Mark Rylance have real pop. The two men have an interesting dynamic as ideological warriors who landed on different sides of the battlefield, and it's the only part of the film that has any real traction because everyone else is locked in a freezer of Cold War archetype. Spielberg capitalizes on the common ground, offering up timely and inspirational rhetoric concerning the importance of due process, Constitutional rights and freedoms, and the American way, but like Lincoln, the big speeches have all the subtlety of a Broadway musical... Abridged from Ex.Press.comA Well-Acted Cold War Thriller Bridge Of Spies is a well acted, thrilling, smart Cold War drama that features a Oscar worthy performance from Tom hanks. Bridge of Spies tells the true story of a Cold War spy swap, during the height of tension between the U.S. and Russia. The time period was so tense that when films can capture that tone it's usually special, that being said the film doesn't quite capture that tone, but it comes close. Tom Hanks performance, and Spielberg's seasoned direction manage to save the film. When the film could have been slow, they save it by using either humor, or great acting, Acting that will most likely get Hanks an Oscar nomination. In the end Bridge of Spies isn't as good as it could have been, but is still admittedly a great film that will undoubtedly get plenty of recognition at the 2015 Academy Awards.Some good acting in an utterly disappointing movie Mark Rylance stands out as the best reason to watch this movie. And, I feel tempted to say, the only reason to do so. His lines take the cream of the screenplay. I am quite a fan of spy movies. That is exactly why I find this to be extremely disappointing as a movie. Seeing Steven Spielberg's name come up at the final credits was a sort of cherry on the funeral cake. The direction and the editing are the two most disappointing elements of this production. Then parts of the story. It is all so predictable, so cliché, so déjà-vu. I happened to watch this film in the weeks in which the BBC broadcast a brilliant 5-part series entitled "London Spy". That is everything a spy-film fan can wish for. "Bridge of Spies" is everything but that. Underwhelming at best...Hanks &amp; Rylance Are Superb Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance lead the way here and give superlative performances in this cerebral and powerful Cold War drama. Another masterful movie from director Steven Spielberg, with a most solid screenplay from Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel. The films all centers around the initial defense of accused Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance) by attorney James B.Donovan (Hanks), which made Donovan a most unpopular man in America, especially when he appealed Abel's conviction all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the conviction by a 5-4 vote. Meanwhile, in 1960, a U.S. U-2 pilot, Francis Gary Powers was captured by the Soviets, after his spy plane was shot down over Soviet territory. Subsequently, the American State Dept. would ask Donovan to possibly negotiate an exchange of Abel and Powers, since Donovan had been contacted by the Soviets through the East Germans that this might be possible. Based on true events, there's plenty of intrigue here as Donovan, through intense and difficult negotiations, tries to acquire the release of the two prisoners, along with a third prisoner the American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), being held on "spy" charges by the East Germans. It will all culminate in some amazing and tense scenes on the German Glienicke Bridge. All in all, I found this to be a first class movie, that despite it's length of 2 hrs. and 21 min., had me absorbed throughout."It doesn't matter what people think. You know what you did." Spielberg knows what he did, but I have a few thoughts. Let's start with the title - You know, there's only one "spy" per se, who matters anyway. But it makes it sound like some thriller-diller, eh? Now Tom Hanks - uh, what's with that incredibly furrowed, knit brow all through the story. Makeup Oscar time? Did they borrow it from a Klingon? The woman who plays Donovan's wife? I know she's supposed to be convincingly all 1950s square - but really, heels and full lipstick all the time? Smiling at everything? At least they didn't plug in Jessica Chastain, that would not have been credible opposite Donovan's shlubby character. A performance as flat as one of those pancakes in the big American breakfast he never ate. The youth are not at this movie, they're all out to see the latest vampire/zombie/Tom Cruise dreck. So the boomers out to see an ennobling patriotic drama have lived through all this, including "duck and cover" and the Missile Crisis. Do those of us who actually were terrorized and traumatized by all that really need pedantic little lessons about the bombs and the sirens, delivered by Donovan's delusional little genius son? I found it insulting. Of course, all the Russians are scene-chewing geeky monsters, sometimes in such close-up we can see the beet-bits in their teeth. Gosh, it was cold in that Cold War! So we have to see everyone blowing and wiping their noses, boogers hanging, in order to get the idea? Exception: Mark Rylance, the only great thing about the movie. I've been watching Rylance in "Wolf Hall," and it's very impressive how he can create such a level of charismatic tension by hardly doing anything at all. He's all stillness, posture, little eye movements and gazes, all restrained, all coiled in. Amazing. Back to the thriller at hand. So in the big spectacle scene where the U2 gets shot down, did Spielberg really need to show off, proving "Oh, I can do 'Gravity,' I can do 'The Walk'" just for bragging cred? And is it actually historically true that Powers gripped on to edge of his crumbling cockpit and just failed to hit the destruct button before his tether broke? (OH! is that a sneaky symbolic allusion to 'aborting' a mission?) This whole thing could have been done as a 15-minute documentary (not that I'd like seeing another documentary) rather than puffed up into a dry and predictable "drama. When we see Hanks' character lying face down on his bed at home because he's so beat, I suppose if I were him I'd be concerned to hide my face for having accepted another such stereotypical heroic individual little man role. Do nasty CIA agents really skip into the air in peevish excitement like an 11-year old when they get frustrated? (Oh, they probably do.) It might have been more exciting to get into a row with the dopey woman in the seats behind us who kept aggravating my wife by kneeing and bumping the back of her seat - but "Would it help?" So the Coen brothers helped write this. I guess Spielberg thought it might be more tasty to shmear some funky mustard on this baloney sandwich, but "Would it help?" My fantasy is that the Coens were often snickering up their sleeves.Cold War Propaganda A new film set in the Cold War era of the 1950's was released a few weeks ago and is apparently a big hit. The plot revolves around James B. Donovan, a simple lawyer who is chosen to defend Colonel Rudolf Abel, a captured Soviet spy, in the midst of an atmosphere of anti-communist hysteria sweeping the US. Later in the movie Mr. Donovan is recruited by CIA to negotiate the release of captured American spies in exchange for Colonel Abel, including U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers who was captured by the Soviets after his spy plane was shot down in Soviet airspace. The tortured tagline of the film sums up the propaganda point to be driven home: "In the shadow of war, one man showed the world what we stand for." What we (the US) stand for is supposedly a just and humane society where everyone, even a communist spy, is entitled to a fair trial. This is set against the supposed tyranny and cruelty of communist states. However, the version of events presented in this film and the case it attempts to make in favor of an American system of "fair play" can easily be disproved. Many relevant details have been distorted or conveniently left out of the narrative. Also, some facts have been included but presented out of any historical context. Unfortunately, most Americans will passively accept this false narrative without question or without doing any further study of their own. They will accept the movie as being a true recounting of historical events. I could now spend a lot of time discussing every single propaganda element within the film such as the dark and gloomy atmosphere in East Berlin; the scowling faces of the East German border guards; the menacing and hostile demeanor of various communist officials or scenes of torture, but I have decided to take a different approach. I will simply tell the truth of the historical incident that this film is supposedly based on; and I will do it using the memoirs of the two primary American participants in these events - James Donovan and Francis Powers. Let's start by comparing the details and outcomes of the Abel trial in the US with that of Powers' trial in the Soviet Union. Both spies were caught red-handed and so there could be no doubt as to their guilt in both cases. Therefore, the purpose of the trials should have been simply to gather all the facts available in an effort to come up with a suitable punishment to fit the crime. Below, I have included a table that shows the results of each trial. Powers (Soviet trial) Abel (US trial) Held Incommunicado 4 weeks 3 weeks Phys. or Psych. Abuse No Yes Max. Poss. Sentence Death (rare cases) Death (very common) Actual Sentence 10 years 30 years Powers stated in his autobiography, written a decade after his return to the US, that he did not suffer any abuse during his captivity in the Soviet Union. Abel, however, said that during his interrogation he was struck in the face by one of the FBI agents who grew frustrated at his silence and refusal to cooperate. Powers was told by the Soviets that execution for espionage was rare in the USSR, but Abel was informed that the death penalty was very likely to be his fate. In fact, just a few years prior to Abel's trial in 1957, the Rosenbergs had been sent to the electric chair for stealing atomic secrets for the Soviet Union. Finally, in the sentences that were eventually handed down, Powers received a relatively light 10 years imprisonment while Abel was given 30 years. The Soviets were accused of subjecting Powers to a "show trial," but this is exactly what the Americans did with Rudolf Abel. As it turns out, despite all the blather about the high ideals of the American legal system, Donovan and his co-conspirators were really just concerned with promoting the idea of superior values of American "fair play," without any regard for the substance behind such claims. Furthermore, the real reason Mr. Donovan argued to save Abel's life was in order to hold him as a bargaining chip in the inevitable event of a spy swap with the Soviets down the road. Mr. Donovan, the humble lawyer, was actually a high-ranking career spy. He admits in his memoirs that at the time he was supposed to be impartially defending Colonel Abel, he was at that moment still a spook! In his own words he reveals that he "still held a commission as a commander in Naval Intelligence." Prior to that he had worked as head legal counsel in the OSS (precursor to the CIA) for several years and had helped to organize the CIA after WWII! However, from the insane viewpoint of American exceptionalism nothing here is out of place, but if this film had been done from the Soviet perspective (taking into account the undeniable facts of the incident), the plot might go like this: The US violates Soviet airspace repeatedly until one of their spy planes is finally shot down. The pilot, despite his refusal to denounce the criminal activity of his government, receives a very light sentence in comparison to America's treatment of captured Soviet agents. Some time later, a CIA spymaster shows up in East Berlin demanding the release of three American spies in exchange for one Soviet spy. Although this naturally strikes the Soviets as unfair, due to their good nature they agree. Colonel Abel returns home to a hero's welcome while Francis Powers is received with suspicion, denounced by the media and much of the American public as a traitor, and is held incommunicado by the CIA for "debriefing" for nearly a month.

New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970.The real title should be "Tom Hanks is a hero, once more" If you expect to see much spying or bridges in this movie you will be sorely disappointed. The plot is about ace lawyer Tom Hanks (his screen name does not really matter, since the movie is just star performance) who is going to prove how good he is, both to the Russians and the East-Germans. A rather puffy-faced Hanks is in most scenes, playing a smug and arrogant lawyer, who always gets the last word and whatever he wants. His performance as a the lawyer is rather overbearing and even slightly unpleasant, but the public still liked him a lot and laughed at all his one-liners (again, star performance, rather than good plot or script). The spies or would-be spies featured in the movie are: 1) a sour little man, who speaks with what sounded to me an Irish accents and who was supposed to be funny with his unflappability. He repeats "Would it help if I worry?" countless times, every time getting a laugh 2) a rather dumb American pilot and 3) another sort of heroic American student, getting mixed up with foreign politics, when he'd better stayed at home. They all seem to be just props to give Hanks a chance to shine. The moral of the story should be that all countries should be better off minding their own business. However, this sound unrealistic, so the moral is that American heroes (especially Tom Hanks) always save the day. Mind the overbearing soundtrack that seems to come straight out "Saving private Ryan"Disappointingly shallow and poorly acted out Hanks, Alda, Spielberg, the Coen brothers. What can go wrong? Apparently, quite a lot. Strengths first: the meticulous recreation of the 60's across two countries is breathtaking. The streets look 60's, the people look and talk 60's, the atmosphere is 60's. It's immersing and awe-inspiring. Now the weaknesses: 1) Lots and lots of exposition. I understand that the millenials are expected to not know the history from 50 years ago, but come on - if someone doesn't know/love history they aren't going to see this movie in the first place. Stop wasting our time with exposition. 2) Poor acting. This must be the weakest performance from Tom Hanks I've seen in years. The guy is sleep-walking through the role, and everyone else is wooden and not worth mentioning, except for Alan Alda who steals every scene he's in. Amy Ryan is just awful I'm sorry to say. 3) Too long. Way too long. Should've ended with the exchange taking place. We don't need the "happy end" through vindication - it's completely implausible too. 4) Not focused. The pilot's story is completely surplus to requirements and insignificant - it doesn't add anything to the narrative. We don't really need to see the pilot until his first scene in captivity. Instead, the time should be spent on character development of which there is absolutely none. 5) Predictable. Yes, the story is well known and we all know how it ends, but this means that the unpredictability needs to be in the nuances. The little things that aren't part of the written history. But everything is predictable, nothing is captivating. 6) The treatment of the story. The script is by the Coen brothers but it has John Le Carre written all over it. It's a classic Le Carre-like spy thriller (thriller, not action). There have been fantastic film adaptations of Le Carre, so we know it can be done. Sadly, on this occasion Spielberg fails to deliver. 4/10Missing something It was opening night, the theater was packed and I was expecting greatness. After all, this story is right in Spielberg's wheelhouse. The time period, cold war, Tom Hanks, the stars were aligned. I will start with this notion, Spielberg's movies are always well acted, always well shot and always beautifully scored. Bridge of Spies does not fail this standard. There are clearly some remarkable acting performances. It wouldn't be a surprise to see some trophies handed out for this work. The director got what he needed, superb acting. The actors did not get what they need, superb story telling. It is the only thing missing here but it's a biggie.  If you know anything about the real life story of James Donovan you could easily imagine a truly exciting movie. The opening credit sequence included this line...Based on Real Events. This disclaimer gives license to the director to "Hollywood up" the story. So basically there are no excuses. In Munich, the director pealed your sole with great story telling, tension and acting. Bridge of Spies had that potential, at least, that's what I was expecting. Tension was left out of this movie for some reason. I theorize Spielberg did this intensionally. Why? Somebody should ask him.Dull and boring. This movie is long, stagy, pretentious and boring. The acting is hammy, and the characters are drab and inspire little interest. The tension should have been gripping. Instead it is absent. The ending of movie is already known and is anti-climatic. The movie seems to suggest that Abel was not treated fairly and downplays the seriousness of his crimes and the sinister nature of his work. The treatment of Francis Gary Powers is completely superficial, which makes the story even weaker. For an audience not familiar with the history surrounding Abel and Powers, this movie will not make any sense at all. This movie contains no heroes, heroines, no damsels in distress, none of the stock characters and situations usually employed to give a story some substance. Instead, the movie just plods along to its foregone conclusion. Why would any movie maker find such bland characters worthy of a movie? The real story is how the Soviets managed to shoot down an American spy plane flying at 70,000 feet. How the Soviets were able to detect and target a U2 flying at that altitude is not explained, nor is the huge political fallout caused by the Powers debacle even mentioned. Indeed, the names of Eisenhower and Khrushchev are absent, yet in the actual event they were the key players, and by leaving them out, there's no story.Mr Smith goes to a bridge I am a Cold War child, born in a country which did have common borders with a Warsaw Pact member but was never a target of thermonuclear destruction. I was still at primary school when I came across a couple of serialized excerpts from Powers' memoir. He really caught my imagination. I saw "The Spy Who Came in from the Cold" and "Across the Bridge" (with Rod Steiger), films in which the bridge is both the passage and the frontier, a no-man's land in which destinies can be decided in a split second of hesitation or bad luck. Bridge of Spies was a great disappointment. Cars and costumes were fine but the spirit and the people of the era was absent. I don't understand why, when I think of "Munich" or "Schindler's List", when there are so many novels to consult for the atmosphere and so many memoirs to consult for the facts. Why was Powers pictured with such unkind shallowness? Why were CIA men and DDR functionaries such caricatures? No matter how great Mark Rylance was, where was the motivation and the ideology of the Soviet spy? Where were the political leaders of the two superpowers? How did the little lawyer from the Bronx become such a cool operative behind the lines, from one day to the other, without experiencing any fear or trepidation? There is nothing wrong with high morals or nostalgia in cinema but when a film tries to portray an episode from a complex political and ideological conflict serving only these ingredients, then I can only be disappointed at the waste of means and opportunities. Pity.very bad fake this is a silly and stupid set of stamps and manifestation of an inferiority complex from a lack of knowledge. In the film, the mass of historical and factual errors, and the film is not a history of the spy Rudolf Abel and his exchange on pilot Francis Gary Powers, and a pretentious propaganda picture. It all started back in the Spielberg movie "Terminal", but in this movie took a truly catastrophic proportions. Spielberg does not have a clue about life in the USSR and the GDR, and all of his view of life in these countries is based on a picture of the American propaganda magazines and newspapers of the time (ie, during the Cold War. Who started the United States and its allies, and the Warsaw Pact was created as a response against the NATO alliance. And the plan of offensive war in Europe, originally did not belong to the Soviet Union and the United States and the United Kingdom). If you are interested in the history of flying spy plane U-2 over the Soviet Union and the subsequent exchange of Francis Gary Powers to the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, see the Soviet movie "Dead Season". It is much better to do than this fake of Spielberg. In addition, in this old Russian movie authentic costumes, interiors and uniforms of the period. Unlike Spielberg film in which nothing is authentic, except for helmets GDR Army. By the way, Francis Gary Powers voluntarily told all in captivity, without tortures and horrors in "Spilberg style". Upon returning to the US, he was accused that not blew himself up along with the aircraft at ejection (under catapult CIA profit laid an explosive charge) and that did not take the poisoned needle for suicide (Francis Powers voluntarily gave the needle during the arrest). If you interesting to see a movie about Powers, watch Soviet movie "We accuse" (1985). As far as I know, in the United States was no movie about Francis Gary Powers. Although he fulfilled his soldier duty to the end, and died like a hero - rescuing children from falling helicopter. This movie - 0 from 10.Very disappointing I personally felt this film was not to my taste. I went in expecting a nice meaty courtroom drama. Turned out it was something else entirely. Something bereft of any drama at all, really. This film is about a man who faces numerous obstacles that he needs to overcome in order to do the right thing. The problem is that each time he comes across an obstacle turns out all he has to do is simply ask someone to remove it for him! And for some reason they do it for him! Every single time! He does this over and over again throughout the film. It's ridiculous. If he can simply ask for whatever wants then there is nothing at stake. There is never any tension.  I wish I had not wasted my money. And I wish I had instead sat at home watching a tin of beans heat up in a microwave. And because everyone knows you can't put metal things in a microwave, it would have at least provided more drama and more tension than the entirety of this very long and very boring film.*Yawn* It's very slow, but still brilliant to say the least.Exclellent Movie - More Excellent Country Than Now This review may be a spoiler if you don't know the real history and haven't seen the movie. This an inspired depiction of the 1960's exchange of a Russian Spy captured by the United States and then traded for our spy captured by the Soviets. The movie is excellent and a sparkling story with superb acting that moves along whether you know what happened or you don't. Tom Hanks is at his best portraying a private attorney requested by the US Government to negotiate the exchange as a private person not a government employee. It gets quite tense at times and I understood it better the second time I viewed it. I gave it a 10. What struck me, and why I am writing this review, is the difference in our country then compared to now. Then we were all patriotic and it was USA first. It is not so now. Now we have many people who refuse to stand for the National Anthem. I liked our country better then than now. Actually I am disgusted at the behavior now. If you are interested as why, check on the NFL.Good film of Cold War true events "Bridge of Spies" is a first rate film about three true events that occurred at the height of the Cold War (1946-1991). They were headline news stories of their day. The first two incidents were unrelated but were tied together by the third event. Director Steven Spielberg and the writing team had a tough job condensing three stories over five years into a film of less than 2½ hours. They had to skip much detail, and the film seems crammed in places. Some things may not be apparent to one who doesn't know the history.  The first event was the 1957 New York arrest, trial and conviction of Rudolf Abel, a Soviet spy. The second event was the 1960 crash of an American spy plane over Russia and the arrest, trial and conviction of the pilot, Francis Gary Powers. The third event was the 1962 prisoner exchange of the two men, along with a second American. The first and last of these three events involve a third principal character, James Donovan, a New York attorney. The film revolves around Donovan and his role in the lives of the captive men.  All of the cast are superb in their roles. The film naturally had Hollywood treatment, so some parts are fiction. Folks interested in the Cold War, or in espionage, or Soviet spying in particular, might enjoy more details. So, I offer some here from my study of these subjects.  Rudolf Abel was one of many aliases of Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (1903-1971). Fisher was an English-born Russian. He moved to Russia in the 1920s, served in the military and became a Soviet intelligence officer. After World War II, he joined the KGB and was trained to spy in the U.S. He left Russia in 1948. Using different IDs and passports, he made his way across Europe to Canada and then the U.S. on Nov. 17. He operated in a spy ring under the code name, Mark. When things heated up, he was about to leave the U.S. with a new ID. But, he was arrested before he could leave. That was June 21, 1957. The film gives a sense of intrigue with Abel's capture. It didn't happen the way the movie portrays it. He answered the door in his hotel room and was arrested by FBI agents. But the scenes with a hollow nickel were one way to bring into the story a real aspect that led to Abel's capture. In 1953, a Brooklyn newspaper boy received a hollow nickel for payment when he was collecting for his paper route. He dropped the coin and it popped open, revealing a piece of microfilm. It wound up in the hands of the FBI. In time, through trailing other known Soviet spies, and the defection of one in May of 1957, the feds were able to corral Abel.  The federal court in New York convicted him of spying and sentenced him to 30 years in prison. He had served just over four years in an Atlanta prison, when he was exchanged in 1962 for Gary Powers. Back home in Russia, Fisher lectured on his experiences until he died at age 68 in 1971. Francis Gary Powers (1929-1977) was a U.S. Air Force jet pilot during 1952-56. He was discharged from the Air Force as a captain in 1956, and went to work for the CIA to fly U-2 missions over the Soviet Union. Those began on Sept. 27, 1956 and continued into 1960. On May 1 of that year, Powers was shot down by a new Soviet ground to air missile, and parachuted to safety. On Aug. 19, the Soviet Union convicted him of espionage and sentenced him to three years in prison and seven years of hard labor. He served just over 21 months in prison before the February 10, 1962 exchange. The movie doesn't show it, but the Powers family and two American attorneys were at his trial. In later years, Powers received honors for his service. Soviet records released after the fall of the Iron Curtain verified the details Power had given of his U-2 flight. Powers died on Aug. 1, 1977 when his TV traffic helicopter crashed in Los Angeles. While making an emergency landing, he swerved to avoid hitting children playing in a park.  James Donovan (1916-1970) took the Abel case after several others had turned it down. He had been in a private law firm just seven years after serving as a commander in the Navy. During World War II, he was associate counsel in a research and development office. After the war, he was assistant to Justice Robert H. Jackson, the chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg war trials in Germany. Donovan was the main negotiator in the prisoner exchange of Abel and Powers, which also included an American student, Frederic Pryor.  While the movie doesn't cover it, Donovan's efforts that same year and the next for Cuban exiles were as harrowing as his negotiations with the Soviets. In June, exiled Cubans asked him to negotiate the release of the Cuban Americans captured by Fidel Castro after the failed April 17, 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The negotiations concluded on July 3, 1963, and led to the release of about 1,100 people. Donovan was just 53 years old when he died of a heart attack in January 1970.  A 1976 TV movie was made about Gary Powers. Lee Majors starred in "Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident." A 1948 movie, "The Iron Curtain," stars Dana Andrews as Igor Gouzenko. He was a Soviet crypto clerk who defected and exposed a massive spy network in Canada and the U.S. The Soviets were way ahead of the U.S. in their espionage work after WW II and during the early years of the Cold War.Query - Rylance 's Oscar. I enjoyed this movie more than I thought would - Tom Hanks is his usual brilliant self and Spielberg directs this really well. My only problem is with Mark Rylance getting an Oscar for his turn as Abel the Soviet spy. He always underplays and I personally do not rate his acting talents at all. He is so laid back as to be almost horizontal. It is, by its subject, a very talky movie but it is well written and none of the talk is wasted time. It is absorbing and interesting about a time when I had little interest in world politics. It all makes sense to me now.From Brooklyn to Berlin ***MILD SPOILERS***True story of the capture conviction and later exchange of Soviet master spy Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance, who was caught in his Brooklyn hotel room by the FBI trying to relay,in a hollowed out US nickel,a secret documents to his Soviet controllers back in 1957. What seemed like an open and shut case of espionage Abel was given insurance lawyer James B. Donovan, Tom Hanks, to represent him to show the world as well as the hated Soviet Union that he was to get a fair trial before he's to be executed or at least sent away for life for his crimes. Donovan really takes his job as well as the US Constatution seriously and defends Abel to the best of his ability only to have his client convicted and given a 30 year sentence which to many Americans seems like a slap on the wrist: That's after the Rosenbergs were executed for the very same crimes that Abel was convicted of some five years earlier. With Abel locked away in federal prison in Georgia and Donoven appealing his conviction US Air Force pilot Francis Gary Powers,Austin Stowell, is shot down with his U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union on of all days May 1-May or Workers Day in the USSR-1960 giving Abel a lifeline for an early out by the US Government who's ready to exchange him for Powers. It was Powers who against orders didn't end up killing himself with a cyanide tipped needle before he was captured by the Russians alive that exposed him as a US spy not a weather man as the US Government claimed he was. With Donovan still Abel's lawyer he's told by his government to negotiate Abel's release in exchange for Powers who's been given a three year sentence, a lot less the Abel was given by the US courts ,behind bars as well as seven years house arrest-In the Moscow Hilton- by the Soviet peoples court. It's with all this going on a love sick American collage student Fred Pryor played by Will Rogers?, not the one you think it is but someone else, is busted by the Communist East German police in trying to get his German girlfriend out of the city of divided Berlin before it's walled up by the East German police as well as military. With the US more then willing to let the totally innocent Pryor hang-by his you know what's- but only wanting to get Powers, who in fact was spying on the USSR, freed Donovan makes it a point to get both Pryor as well as Donovan freed or else he just won't cooperate with his string pullers in both the State Department and Pentagon. ***MILD SPOILERS SINCE HISTORY ALREADY SHOWED US WHAT HAPPENED***Donovan prevailed in the end getting both Powers as well as Pryor freed for the return of Rudolf Able in a nail biting exchange on the Berlin Gilenicke Bridge with out as much as a shot, in anger or celebration, being fired. Donvovan who was hated and called a dirty Commie by almost everyone who knew him is now a hero not only by getting Powers and Pryor back but later getting over 9,000 Cuban freedom fighters and their families back to freedom after being captured and arrested by Castro's troops in the disastrous "Bay of Pigs" invasion of Communist Cuba in 1961. As for Francis Gary Powers the main man in this movie he never was given the respect that he deserved in him not killing himself before the Commies or Russans captured him thus exposing the entire U-2 spy operations to the world at large. And putting the US, who up until then said it was national policy not to spy on anyone, the self proclaimed "Good Guys of the Free World" in a bad light.Well done Well-acted, well-written, well-directed, well-produced. Spielberg and the Coen brothers take an interesting episode in world history and craft a compelling, dramatic story.  About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it. My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of "terrible", with 5 being "mediocre" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A Classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating)Getting across the wall Bridge of Spies is a pedestrian cold war drama that combines the talents of Steven Spielberg and the Coen brothers. It really is a literal title as the climax takes place on a bridge and it has spies. Tom Hanks plays an insurance lawyer. We are meant to root for him even though as he tries to stiff a personal injury lawyer. Remember folks, his insured driver injured five people but he wants to limit it as one claim. Hanks really has the hang of these types of characters now, sturdy, steady, steadfast with just a hint of overacting. He plays James Donovan who is called in to defend Rudolf Abel a captured KGB spy operating in the USA. He places his life at risk to save him from the death penalty, being astute enough to realise that Abel may become useful in later years. So it does when the Russians capture a U-2 spy plane pilot. Donovan then has to put his personal safety at risk by going to East Germany to negotiate a spy swap. The film features a critically acclaimed performance from Mark Rylance who plays Abel and won a best supporting actor Oscar. Rylance is an example of a subtle, understated performance. Spielberg is a master craftsman but the film is just too cumbersome and stuffy. It never has the labyrinthic thrills of a John Le Carre story. There is some wonderful art direction but the film really needed some zap.***1/2 Someone will have to explain to me why Mark Rylance won the best supporting Oscar award for this very good film, especially in a year where Sylvester Stallone was well favored to garner the award. That being said, this was a very good film showing the efforts of a Brooklyn lawyer in going to Europe to secure the swap of Rudolph Ivanovich Abel, a Russian spy with Gary Francis Powers, the latter getting caught during the U-2 Spy Incident during the waning years of the Eisenhower administration. Hanks, as the attorney, is relentless that the swap must include the economics student who was studying in East Germany at the wrong time. The film showed the break that there was between East Germany and the Soviet Union.OK story, but too long and too slow This is a movie about spies during the cold war. Main problem was the movie was well over 2 hours with not enough excitement or tension. Plot is Rudolf Abel is arrested for being a Russian spy, I guess he was but never really admits it. Tom Hanks plays James his lawyer. When an US pilot gets captured by the Russians, James makes a play to trade Rudolf for him. He does the dangerous work of even going to Berlin and meeting with Russian and German officials. He learns of a US student whom has been arrested in Berlin, so going against what he's told, he tries to bargain for the student also. So of course the 2 sides have issues, but in the end James is able to negotiate the release of both US detainees.  FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, but only watch it if you got a lot of time on your hands.Good Entertainment if You Don't Need Historical Accuracy or Reality We enjoyed this movie on a purely entertainment level. If you don't have to have historical accuracy and logic, this will do for that. The movie is filled with mucho movie clichés, for example, a dark stormy, rainy night to set the anxious scene for the shady CIA agent following Tom Hanks, cold blizzardy snow to set the East Germany post war gloom and danger, mean/cold/evil CIA agents, a judge that doesn't care about following proper legal proceedings, WW II era German soldiers, cold and calculating Soviets, 1950's innocence in America, Commie hating Americans, unquestioning allegiance to the Military, and of course everything has to be based on a time deadline and come down to a happy ending at the last moment. The first part of the movie made me uncomfortable because of its historical inaccuracy and exaggerations. Once I stopped looking for accuracy and reality as necessities, I settled down to just being entertained.  Gary Powers clinging to his spinning out of control U-2 was both exciting and silly. A person attached to an out of control airplane that was falling at +400 mph would be torn apart. I believe the historically accurate story was less exciting. Gary Powers ejected after his plane was hit, failed to destroy the aircraft and take his suicide pill, and was captured, to the embarrassment of the U.S. The movie takes a long time to move through the story that we know has to have a happy ending. It's filled with almost there, then failure, then almost there again. That's the main pattern of the telling. Tom Hanks is always Tom Hanks, no matter who he plays these days. He's no longer the intense actor we saw in "Big", "Forrest Gump", "Cast Away", or his other blockbuster masterpieces.  The overall theme of the story was a good one. Spying was considered a necessary part of the Cold War, and both sides denying that they were spying was part of the game. History loses something in the telling.An interesting story but it's one that is imbalanced and poorly structured (minor spoilers) James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is a lawyer who practices in 'insurance' law, but when he's tasked with defending Soviet spy and traitor Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) it proves to be a case that is not only career-defining for Donovan, but one that is also life-changing as well. Bridge Of Spies was a film that did hold my interest and have me gripped (up until the conclusion of Abel's trial). However, from this point on, at least as far as I was concerned, it gradually became less and less interesting.... The first problem lies with how the film has been structured - Bridge Of Spies is a film that runs for over 2 hours, but in those 2 + hours the film essentially only has two threads hanging it together (Abel's trial and the exchange of prisoners). What you get here is about 45 minutes of trial and about 90 minutes of Donovan's various conversations with government officials. As I've said the first third of it is OK, but the final two thirds of the picture are repetitive and rather dull and it quickly becomes evident that the prisoner exchange aspect of the story does not necessitate 90 minutes worth of screen time. The next issue lies with how imbalanced the whole film feels; as I've said great portions of the film are spent on both Abel's trial and on Donovan's wonderful negotiating skills in effecting the prisoner exchanges, but Spielberg and his team of scriptwriters (2 of whom are the Coen brothers) seem to overlook other aspects of the film such as what happened to Abel whilst he was in the US? What happened to Powers when he was captured in Russia? What happened to the American student whilst he was held in Germany? Spielberg sets all these plot points up on an assembly line, but doesn't delve deeper into any of these plot points which at times means that the film lacks depth and insight. I was particularly disappointed that Powers didn't factor as prominently in the story considering that he was quite an important character. Rylance won an Oscar for his performance here which I personally found a bit puzzling (yes he's OK, but I didn't really see anything brilliant about his performance). Hanks again is OK but he generally gives a fairly stock 'everyman' performance which isn't that big a stretch for him. When all is said and done I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed by Bridge Of Spies; to me it put too much focus in some areas and not enough focus in other areas which resulted in an imbalanced and poorly structured film. I think the best way to summarise it would be 'interesting subject matter that was poorly delivered.'Spy Chase Spielberg Style Although very good to look at and mostly continually interesting (while maybe a little over length) this bridge may not hold as much weight as it could have. I suppose we should know what we can expect with Spielberg at the helm. While I agree this is one of his better movies, it still offers the usual over exaggerated bits just to liven up the action - while some facts get overlooked for the sake of 'entertainment'. We don't get to know anything about the character the whole show is built around - not even what his bit of folded paper was all about, so have to assume this was perhaps mocked-up to hold our interest. Mr Hank's wife is just a bit too difficult to believe - especially her reaction after their home and family get shot up!- then again, with that whole segment being a fabricated beat-up (this looks like Cohen Bros stuff) I guess it also fits in with the way Hollywood saw 50's women.  It's mostly good based on fact dramatic entertainment with an element of fanciful trimmings - what more could be expected of a Spielberg/Cohen partnership?. Another positive comes in the way Award winner Marc Rylance as Abel (the spy) and Tom Hanks as his defense, perfectly bounce words and glances off each other.Boring to Death!!! During the Cold War, an American lawyer is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers. I never thought that i would ever watch a Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks movie and get so goddamn bored i really lost my interest after 30 minutes and Mark Rylance? He wasn't even that great to begin with and it amazes me how he even won that Oscar instead of Stallone who was magnificent in Creed. Tom Hanks is as great as always but the boring pacing it just ruins the whole movie and the audience's experience and to be honest i had more fun with Indiana Jones 4 than this.A bridge too far. Spielberg's latest film, Bridge of Spies ends up being about exactly that. A bridge in Berlin where captured spies are swapped from east to west. And the hero of the piece, played by Tom Hanks, is the one good American who will win the day and save the participants. And that is where my least favourite trope of a Spielberg film comes out. There's no denying that Spielberg is a good filmmaker and a master storyteller. I just wish that he wouldn't allow his sentimentality to subvert the real subjects of his movies. What Bridge of Spies should be about, and briefly is, are the two contrasting spies in this mostly true story. The film opens with Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) being captured. It's made clear that there is no question of his guilt. The government doesn't want anything to do with the defence, so attorney James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is randomly assigned to the case. Its then that you get to see the performance of Rylance dominate in his sessions with Donovan. Seemingly non-plussed, Abel doesn't seem to care about his fate and Rylance brings a real sense of eccentricity and intelligence to his character. The trial is stacked against him, with zero chance of an acquittal and that's when the film started to lose my interest. Minutes are devoted to the actual trial and the viewer is left to wonder about the nature of the evidence and the drama of the case. I hoped to learn more about the psychology of spydom, and Rylance has the nuance to reveal it. Ultimately, the character remains an unknowable cipher. But it's deemed unimportant because Spielberg has bigger fish to fry. Namely, after the conviction, the suggestion by Donovan that in lieu of sentencing, Abel may be used as a trade for an American spy being held by the Soviets. This turns out to be U.S. air pilot Francis Gary Powers, shot down over Soviet air space while on a reconnaissance mission. His guilt isn't in question either, but unlike Abel, we don't get to know too much about Powers other than the fact that he is young and handsome. His instructions were to blow up his plane and commit suicide if he is captured, neither of which he does. It's difficult to care about his fate, particularly with his actions remaining unquestioned. He seems more pawn than spy. So the trade seems unbalanced. The second half of the movie shifts the focus almost completely to Donovan and his mission to make the spy swap in Berlin. We get an hour or so of stereotypical, and in some cases ridiculous agents and diplomats of the East German and Soviet variety. And this is where Spielberg really shows his hand. He uses Hanks for his Jimmy Stewart quality as an aw shucks, righteous man who not only manages the swap, but gets an extra prisoner, an American student held in East Berlin. We've been prepared for this since the start with scenes that show what a good husband and father he is, a sympathetic and kind lawyer, and, it seems, the only character with a pure agenda. So by the end, the film becomes a flag waving tribute to the decency of a simple, honest man. Forrest Gump does détente.Excellent and often very absorbing film, without being one of Spielberg's finest 'Bridge of Spies' had much going for it, mainly that it's based on a very interesting story, Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance are talented actors with some very noteworthy performances and when in his prime Steven Spielberg directed some of the most relentlessly entertaining and entertaining films in cinema. While 'Bridge of Spies' is not one of Spielberg's finest films, in the way 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'ET', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Empire of the Sun', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'Jurassic Park' are, for me despite its flaws along with 'Lincoln' and 'War Horse' (remember liking 'Munich' a lot too, though it needs a re-watch) it's one of his better ones since 'AI'. There is not an awful lot wrong with 'Bridge of Spies', though due to the subject matter it's not going to appeal to all tastebuds. To me, it's biggest problem was pacing. By all means not a continuous problem, because there was enough in the film that was really engaging, but parts do drag and not every scene felt like it was needed. The beginning is notably draggy and the film could easily have ended after the climactic scene on the bridge, because the ending did feel unnecessarily stretched and was particularly guilty of the sappiness and over-sentimentality that Spielberg is often criticised for. Similarly Donovan's family scenes could have been excised with no problem, they add very little and their cloying nature did feel too much and misplaced within the rest of the film. The only other problem was Thomas Newman's score, it's nicely composed and it fits at least (to have it used sparingly was also a good move in order to not distract from the atmosphere and dialogue) but there is nothing hugely memorable or anything to go wow over or that evokes any strong emotions. Not bad as such, just bland. However, 'Bridge of Spies', as always with Spielberg is incredibly well-made, as well as directed with a lot of class. It is sumptuously shot and the period detail is elegant, atmospheric and positively eye catching, especially the scenes in Berlin where you actually feel the cold, austerity and tension. While there is a lot of talk in 'Bridge of Spies', the script is thought-provoking and tightly structured, not making the mistake of being rambling, using complicated jargon or being too wordy. There is even some nice knowing witty humour that gives the film some freshness and is well-incorporated when it appears, while the political and patriotic elements avoid being preachy. While the pace is not completely secure and not every scene felt necessary, the story is very absorbing and is told with intelligence, tension and emotion. While there is perhaps not enough on the trial, that part is very intriguingly done, while the Berlin scenes that dominate the film have a lot of tension and suspense. The shift from America to Berlin is handled well and not too crudely, a very easy thing to do when visually and atmospherically their scenes are so different. The characters are engagingly written on the most part, with the exception of Donovan's family (his wife in particular is the typical nurturing but frustrated cliché with little variation on it). Donovan is one of those characters that holds the narrative together as strong as a rock and is easily rootable, while Abel comes close to being the most sympathetic character while at the same time evoking some chills. The chemistry between the two characters is very strongly done. All the acting is very good (though Amy Ryan barely registers in the role that gives her very little to work with), with Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance being outstanding. Hanks is effortlessly commanding and has such a great cool charisma, essential for a lead role that is on screen for almost the whole duration. Despite his screen time being much less, Rylance portrays Abel with quiet understated dignity, with his expressions and eyes speaking every bit as much as when he's delivering his lines, that comes over both chillingly and heart-wrenchingly. All in all, excellent and often very absorbing. 7.5/10 Bethany CoxBridge of Spies displays a lot of patriotism, character, and love for your enemies. Bridge of Spies had an amazing display of sincere and authentic care for your enemies. The display of love for your enemies in this movie is a great example of who we are supposed to be in Christ when we struggle to do the right thing against our sin nature. For when we love our enemies, our friends may hate us for it, but we can be assured in who we are in Christ by not backing down in our character and convictions even if the crowd demands our head. In the Bible in Matthew 5:43-45 it says, "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven." Character is also greatly displayed in Donovan's character throughout the movie. For example when the American government asks Donovan to violate attorney client privilege defending an accused Russian spy on American soil, Donovan refuses quoting the constitution and stays true to his client and character. Bridge of Spies is a great movie filled with true patriotism.Cheap CGI and predictable plot Spielberg has done it again: After the lame and shameful CGI in Indy 4, Bridge of Spies returns with some terrible CGI of a plummeting plane so lame that makes the fake plastic baby form American Sniper a masterpiece.  The movie is OK, but it's flat and predictable: **SPOILER HERE** A brilliant lawyer (Hanks) defends a soviet spy and works his ways not to send him to the electric chair in case 'someday' a US pilot is caught by the soviets and there's a need to exchange them both. What happens a minute later? You guessed right: A US pilot is held prisoner (the one in the cheap CGI plane) and Tom Hanks is in charge of the exchange. Tadaaah.  Also a US student is held prisoner just because, but Tom Hanks manages to free them both after 3 long hours of chit chat and blurry backgrounds thanks to the cheap CGI that fills every corner of the movie.Interesting but somewhat draggy To start off, Tom Hank's acting was spot on. He played the character James Donovan well, and the film as a whole allows us to root for him and to feel what he feels, even though everyone looks down on him for his ideals. Mark Rylance's character (Rudolf Abel) was dry in my opinion, although there were small moments where he shined.  The plot as a whole was interesting, but the movie's progress felt somewhat slow. Was it to build up tension? I'd guess so, though I didn't feel it and I was always waiting for more to happen (to no avail, until the finale). The movie could have been shortened to an hour an a half, in my humble opinion. Perhaps it is somewhat due to the relatively simple and short main plot.  Not an absolute must watch in my opinion. I'm sorry but I expected so much more.  6/10Spielberg Can Make Even the Cold War Maudlin I thought that the Coen brothers as co-screenwriters of "Bridge of Spies" meant that we might get some restraint and intelligence to balance the maudlin platitudes that almost certainly come attached with a Steven Spielberg film. But I was wrong. Spielberg takes a chilly Cold War setting and then proceeds to pump sentimentality into it until by the end it's as sunny and warm as a Folgers coffee commercial. Tom Hanks, as usual, does his best to calm Spielberg down, and plays the main character as an every man Joe trying to do the right thing despite Spielberg's attempts to cram his heroics down our throats. But by the film's end, he's as overwhelmed by the rest of us by Spielberg's schmaltz, served with healthy doses of the requisite pounding Spielbergian score, this one supplied not by John Williams but rather by Thomas Newman. Mark Rylance won an Oscar for playing a Russian spy who barely speaks, and I suppose I appreciated his ability to convey emotions without histrionics, something Spielberg certainly isn't capable of. But I can't say I really see that he did anything special enough to warrant an Academy Award. The Coens were nominated for their script, which they co-wrote with Matt Charman, and the film also copped nominations for Best Picture, Production Design, Original Score, and Sound Mixing. Grade: B-An exciting film which however varies wildly from the real truth This film is an example of myth-making, whether intentional or not I do not know. There is very little chance that the U-2 spy aircraft supposedly 'shot down' in 1960 by the Soviets in the notorious 'U-2 Incident' was really shot down at all. The various existing stories significantly contradict each other. The Russians say they fired one S-75 Dvina missile, but two different internet sites say that seven or thirteen missiles were fired, one shooting a MIG-19 out of the sky by mistake. I do not believe that any of these stories is true. We now know that Lee Harvey Oswald insisted the plane was never really shot down, and papers released in 2012 by the CIA show that they never believed either that their own man, the young pilot Francis Gary Powers, was really shot down. So why should the film suggest that he was and perpetuate a now discredited myth? It was apparently impossible for the Soviets' S-75 missile to hit a target flying at above 70,000 feet as the U-2 was. Nor did they have the guidance and control capacity to hit the plane even if a rocket existed which could get that high with any semblance of accuracy. The film shows the plane crashing nose-downward, which contradicts the official report that it crashed nose-upwards. But it appears that the truth is it never crashed, and merely landed normally, as part of a complex and mysterious political plot. It has been suggested that this was to derail détente, but that may not be the whole story. There are other ambiguities regarding Powers himself. There seems to be no certainty as to his birthplace. In the 1960s he was said to be from Pound, Virginia, but on Wikipedia it says Jenkins, Kentucky, or perhaps Burdine, Kentucky. All three places are near one another on the Kentucky-Virginia border, and I used to know the area well. In the old days, apart from Highway 23, there was nothing but dirt tracks. The region is one of the wildest and most remote in the entire Appalachians. I have spent many, many weeks there in the distant past. The area was populated almost entirely by genuine hillbillies, who lived in log cabins and still hunted with flintlock rifles. I know this because I met them as a child, entered their log cabins, and held their flintlocks. I was not allowed to fire one because the gunpowder was precious and they cast their own lead ball shot from an iron mould. But the boy who let me hold and aim his own precious flintlock, which had an immensely long barrel and had 'belonged to my great-great-great-grand-pappy', was from about 1800 or even earlier. Using it, the family got most of their wild meat. The boy told me, in words I shall never forget: 'I can shoot the head off a squirrel at a hundred yards with my flintlock.' It was from this wild area that Powers was supposed to have originated, as well as another well known and notorious CIA-linked figure. (The coincidence of two major spy figures coming from the same dot on the map is impossible.) I also knew as a child a genuine local man who told me the CIA and FBI both had a special connection with Pound, Virginia, and that he had been hired himself by the FBI to do messenger work across the South and to report regularly to Pound. When Powers died mysteriously in 1977, many people thought he had been murdered. So all of these matters are extremely murky, and we shall probably never know the real truth about any of it. As for the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, I do not know what the film's agenda is for showing him as a quiet gentle, thoughtful, and artistic man, who is repeatedly described as 'honourable'. Why also is the entire American population shown in the film as foaming-at-the-mouth McCarthyites who want to lynch Abel and Donovan? Are Soviet spies being set up as the new heroes? What is going on with this film? The idea that the supposedly naive insurance lawyer Donovan would be taken to see Allen Dulles, who would tell him he could carry out his own private negotiations with the Soviets at the height of the Cold War involving a spy and a captured pilot, is totally and outrageously ludicrous. Donovan had been part of the legal team at Nuremberg and must have had intelligence affiliations already in the 1940s. Rudolf Abel (aka Willie Fisher) appears to have been a failure as a Soviet spy in America, and it defies belief that the Soviets would exchange a high-value captured American airman for him. The suspicion is that the American and Soviet security services cooperated secretly, with or without the knowledge of their own governments, to stage these phoney events. The film does not make clear that Abel had been in jail for four years before the swap for Powers, and was hence 'old news'. The film maintains that the East Germans resented and defied the Soviets, which is absurd, since East Germany was the most supine and devoted Soviet satellite state in the entire Warsaw Pact. If the Germans had behaved as shown in the film, they would have been summarily executed. Why are we expected to swallow all this nonsense? The direction of the film by Stephen Spielberg is superb, and the performances by Tom Hanks as the lawyer Donovan and Mark Rylance as Abel are outstanding in every way. (Powers features only as a minor figure in the two parallel stories shown here, which only come together with the spy swap on the bridge in Berlin.) But how much better and more interesting the film would have been if it had been accurate, and had explored the many mysterious byways and unanswered enigmas and contradictions. Instead, it adds to the existing, enormous disinformation overload.Not bad but a bit boring I'm not really a fan of Tom Hanks but in this film, he gave a good, albeit not brilliant, performance as Donovan, who suffered public scorn to do what he thought was right. I went into this film unaware that it was based on real live events but at the end, it showed some of Donovan's accomplishments after these events and I was impressed by the number of people he saved; 9703. However in the film, I wasn't hugely impressed by Tom Hanks, although he's by no means a bad actor. Supporting actor Mark Rylance was good, perhaps better than Hanks, and had some funny moments particularly with his main phrase "Would it help?"  I'm not entirely sure if this was meant to be a funny film but it got a laugh out of the audience a fair few times. There were scenes showing Abel's indifference to his situation and Donovan had some amusing lines here and there, but it seemed that the films tone was supposed to be a bit more serious and the humorous parts ruined that slightly. That said, the funny scenes weren't bad, but would probably have been better suited to a more humorous film. There were some things I liked such as the friendship that developed between Abel and Donovan over the course of the film. Their relationship was the films strong point in my opinion. Another part that I liked was at the end, when Donovan was on the train and saw some people climbing over a fence. This links back to an earlier scene in Berlin, where some people were trying to scale a wall and got shot down, which is a good contrast between Berlin and New York. I thought the judge was a jerk and it seemed to me that he was letting his prejudice against Abel influence his decision in the courtroom, so I was glad when Donovan managed to talk him out of giving Abel the death sentence. To me, the judges behavior showed that some people can't be trusted with power, but it was nice to see that he wasn't totally corrupt, so perhaps I misjudged him.  This film had a lot of talk about negotiation and politics and since I have little interest in either - largely because I don't trust politicians - it wasn't really my kind of movie. However, I wouldn't call it a bad film. Tom Hanks has some good speeches and there's a funny line here and there, so if you like movies about what goes on behind the scenes in a war, instead of focusing on shooting and explosions, you'll probably like this film. There is a bit of shooting and blowing things up - specifically a plane used to spy on the enemy - but it's kept to a minimum, focusing mainly on Donovan's struggle to help Abel.A somewhat exciting but rather bland story of Americans helping each other Bridge of Spies is about a simple American lawyer, played by Tom Hanks, who during the 60's Cold War defends a Soviet spy, played by Mark Rylance. Hanks eventually end up in the middle of East Berlin to negotiate a trade, the Soviet spy for an American pilot. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg which means that the two heavyweights are reunited once again, the last time being in 2004 when they collaborated on The Terminal. Bridge of Spies was nominated for an Oscar, among others in the category for best picture. Mark Rylance won surprisingly for best supporting role. Bridge of Spies is a very skillfully crafted film but with such a competent director as Steven Spielberg, I wasn't expecting anything else. What really stands out with Bridge of Spies is how great they've recreated East Berlin in the 60's. The production design, the costumes and the music is indeed top class. I was curious about the story itself, but at the same time I sort of suspected it to be a pretty one-sided tale of American heroism. I was right. The fact that Bridge of Spies is told from an American perspective is not a problem, there are tons of great films told that way. The thing that bothers me is the liberties they take with the truth, just for dramatic effect. Everything can of course not be true in a film based on real events, but this film steps over the line a couple of times. An example of this is the portrayal of how the Soviet treats their prisoners just to make them look worse. The other thing that bothers me is the pacing of the film and the fact that it never really takes off. It's sort of like watching a motion picture combined with a documentary where they twist and turn the truth. Hanks spends a lot of time in East Berlin without ever really finding out anything new and vital. With its 2 hours and 20 minutes, Bridge of Spies is simply too long and could have been made on or below 2 hours. The story is however interesting and the film looks good, 6 out of 10. David Lindahl - www.filmografen.seFelt like it was directed by a committee. This is worth watching for the acting. Hanks and especially Rylance were masterful. Their characters carried the film. I kept wanting more, to hear how these honorable men, in opposite enemy camps planning to blow up the World, each doing their duty for beliefs and country, learn to know and like each other. Alas, this film hinted at the depth of their relationship but could have showed so much more. Rather, like a parasitic over-the-top twin, the movie within a movie interrupted the story. The U-2 pilot was more Millennium Falcon than Air Force, the U-2 special effects more "Gravity" than realistic high altitude ejection, and the U-2 training--OJT rather than classroom, made me laugh when humor was not intended. Some of the plot points felt gimmicky so I read up on the history after watching, and the film did take some literary license with several of the historical details. Although some were clearly worth the payoff to maintain tension, some struck me as more distracting than dramatic. The sense of place and feeling of the Cold War comes through, but don't watch this film to prep for a history test. Overall, the storytelling, pacing, and acting -- especially the two lead characters, make this well worth watching.Mostly Well-Made but Very Forgettable and a Little Slow Bridge of Spies is based on the true story of an insurance lawyer during the Cold War who is chosen to defend a Russian spy in court simply to give the man a fair trial, and he decides to take it too far. For the most part it's well presented, but it doesn't stand out as anything special.  The plot is one that I think we've all seen before. There's someone who wants to help beyond his call of duty, so he does. It's not a bad plot line, but it's not a particularly good one. It's like a superhero movie without the capes. Although Bridge of Spies is much better than most superhero movies. It's not very well-paced all the time though, and it does drag a little pretty much throughout the entire movie. I always felt myself checking the remaining run time and wondering how the movie would find enough content to compensate for its 142 minute run time. It does, though, and I think that for the most part it did it well.  The character development is just fine. Jim Donovan is just like any other main character in these kinds of movies: He wants to help people, and he overdoes it more than expected despite people not wanting him to. Other than him, there's hardly any focus on any other character, so in short, they're just fine. Nothing special, but not bad either.  The acting is just fine too. Mark Rylance, who somehow won an Oscar for his performance, is such a minor character that he barely had enough time to showcase his skills as an actor. Sure, he's important to the story, but he has barely enough screen time to really be considered all that important. This is more of a personal issue that doesn't really affect my opinion of the movie, however, and is more directed at the Oscars themselves.  Overall Bridge of Spies is a good movie. It's not fantastic, it's not great, it's just good. It's one of those movies that I just watched and will probably never watch again or think about really afterwards. It's pretty forgettable, actually. Nothing about it stood out in particular, it was just good. In the end I'd recommend this movie. Maybe you'll love it, maybe you'll hate it, and maybe you'll just like it. I can see why anyone would feel any of those ways.Topical Message is Too Profound to be Delivered So Dry and Deliberate So, more than a Decade after "The Patriot Act" and every Non Neo-Con in the Country weighed in with Loud and Convincing Arguments about "The Constitution", "The Bill of Rights", and the foundation of the Country's "American Values" at Risk, what with Torture now being called "Enhanced Interrogation Techniques", and so forth, Spielberg and His "Band of Brothers" have made a Film with the same Arguments. Everyone falling all over Themselves about this "High Moral Ground" Movie, where have you been? Tom Hanks, the Coen Brothers, and others Contribute to this A-List Film and all should be Commended for Their Contribution. Mark Rylance as Abel, the Soviet Spy (true story) Deserves His Oscar Credit. But the Nomination for Best Film of the Year by the Oscars. Hardly. The Film is Peppered with Spicy Scenes that Intrigue but Interest Wanes now and then with the Lethargic Pace and Dry Composition. The Message is Obvious but why Deliver it in such a Matter of Fact, Drawn Out, Lengthy Story that Sputters at times. This is one of those that the Parts are much Better than the Whole Thing and this Thing is surely Professional Artisism at its Highest Level, but as a Profound Picture with a Heavy Political and Topical Message. Not so much. It Misses the Mark and that is to Package the Content in a Gripping and Unforgettable Film that can not be Overlooked by the Masses. The Method that the Director and His Team chose, will Alienate Half the Audience and most likely will Never get the Encrypted Memo.Competent, unspectacular but enjoyable A well-made and acted but understated cold-war drama about the exchange of prisoners between the USA and the USSR in Germany. Tom Hanks is reliably good as the insurance lawyer James Donovan, drawn into cold-war intrigue, representing a Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in court. Mark Rylance gives a quiet, understated performance as the spy. Rylance is competent, but the performance is rather a surprising nod for an Oscar. After an American spy pilot is shot down over Soviet air space, much of the film is set in Berlin as Donovan negotiates with Soviet and East German authorities for the release of the pilot and an American student captured in East Berlin in exchange for Abel. The scene where the pilots plane is shot down, is poorly filmed with cheap special effects.  But otherwise the film is well shot with excellent period detail and atmosphere. Although some of the scenes in East Berlin verge slightly on absurd, a hint of the Coen brothers influence as screenwriters for the film. Amy Ryan is largely wasted as Donovan's wife while the early scenes detailing Abels court case feel a bit short and underdeveloped. And the final scenes fall prey to Steven Spielberg's usual twee sensibilities. But overall, the film represents a decent notch in the well worn and capable partnership between Spielberg and Hanks.A Dust-Off Slide-Solid Polit-Thriller Movie Review: "Bridge of Spies" (2015) Three years after releasing Academy-Award-nominated "Lincoln" starring Daniel Day-Lewis as 16th President of the United States, comes this Berlin-Wall building time period og early 1960s Germany screenplay atmospherically-researched by Joel &amp; Ethan Coen to the utmost attention of director Steven Spielberg, who had decided to make it a 135-Minute Polit-Drama, which no one hurts of just being clever motion picture entertainment. Leading actor Tom Hanks as capable U.S. constitution-defending Lawyer James B. Donovan, who travels to post-world-war-II Berlin, Germany in highly-visceral as moody remaining 35mm film cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and professional because accurate production design by Academy-Award-winner Adam Stockhausen, when "Bridge of Spies" already wastes his suspense feed in the first 30 minutes screening a remarkable sequence featuring supreme support actor Mark Rylance as the character Rudolf Abel, who exchanges tiny encrypted messages within only razor-sharpness' able to open split metallic coins for the precious "Intel" with regard to common park-bank placements. "Bridge of Spies" directed by Steven Spielberg is no surprise, but highly-professional, enduring as a quality motion picture, nevertheless missing the moment of truth, at least emotionally with a title-given bridge-exchange of cold-war prisoners in the final thirty minutes to no suspense-consequence of just being there. FAZIT: Picture approved (breakable)  Copyright 2018 Cinemajesty Entertainments LLCMilestone film in Steven Spielberg career Another milestone film in director Steven Spielberg's feather. This one is really a heart melting and inspirational story which based on true incidents. An attorney from USA, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) willing to take risk of his lifetime to bring the freedom for the three mistakenly captures by USA, RUSSIA &amp; GERMAN during the period of Cold War. The climax made me to cried. And the best part is that his childrens do not even know that their father is an attorney, which they thought was a fisherman or sailor until the news telecast in television. "Bridge of Spies is the true story of three extraordinary characters - William Fisher, alias Rudolf Abel, a British born KGB agent arrested by the FBI in New York City and jailed as a Soviet superspy for trying to steal America's most precious nuclear secrets; Gary Powers, the American U-2 pilot who was captured when ..."you don't seem alarmed.. Bridge Of Spies The negotiations are predictable and a bit eerie, maybe because it is based on factual events which the maker in here, does not completely rely upon giving enough space for the drama to fit in. Bridge Of Spies is way too long for its material; especially the side characters that follows upto the event seems a bit redundant, and needs better editing. Spielberg does not let the movie slip away even for a frame; his execution is amazing in it and gives enough range for the actors to settle in on the screen. Tom Hanks has the job to glue all the sequences up for the audience to root for the character for he is the only common or familiar on screen and he stinks to its job very well with some good supporting cast like Mark Rylance. Bridge Of Spies comes off enthralling to the audience contrary to its genre; which I suppose shows the excellence of the director, for the writing seemed a bit loose on building up the characters for the audience to that level of drama as it was on paper.A hit from Spielberg I always find Spielberg a hit-and-miss director; for every winning thriller like MUNICH there's a piece of tat like INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL to come along and reduce the director's stature in my eyes. Thankfully, BRIDGE OF SPIES is one of his mature films, which translates into talkiness which is never boring thanks to a very strong script that recalls great Cold War thrillers like THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. Tom Hanks is once again a likeable, quick-thinking everyman who this time around is tasked with defending a Russian spy in the courts. I remember despising Mark Rylance's WOLF HALL when I attempted watching it, but Rylance is at the top of his game here and extremely likeable as the self-effacing spy. The film's true story origins means it has the ring of authenticity throughout and Spielberg admirably avoids sentimentality, instead presenting complex characters working their way through complicated situations. The end result is a film which delights from beginning to end.Really well made Cold War true story 'Bridge of Spies' is an espionage thriller at its finest. It's set in the late 50s &amp; early 60s and certainly looks the part - I always love seeing the old cars driving around New York, looking classy. Starts off like any classic spy film, but then Abel (Rylance) is caught. In comes Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer who is asked to defend Abel, so he can receive due legal practice. The first 45min or so is a good courtroom drama and moves along fast enough, with Hanks giving a few great speeches and making some solid points about what's right and what's best. The movie really captures well the Cold War tension in America and what families would've gone through. It helps that this is the best film Spielberg has made in a few years and the best film Hanks has been in for a while. Once the movie turns into political chess, with an exchange of Abel for Powers (Stowell) in Berlin, the stakes are raised and there's plenty of great subterfuge. Hanks basically owns the film, with everyone having some good moments (especially Rylance, with his "would it help?"s), but he really plays a great everyman who stands up to both Germany, Russia &amp; his own country (mostly portrayed by the CIA/Shepherd) for what is morally right and just, not just what is politically acceptable at the current time.Just Solid, Classic Spielberg One of the most prolific directors in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg, returns to the silver screen with his new period thriller "Bridge of Spies" starring two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks. It features competent and solid filmmaking from its director, writers, and crafts team however, the film doesn't quite ignite passion and excitement from its standard storytelling. What really manages to standout is the impeccable and sensational performance of Emmy Award nominee Mark Rylance, who steals and owns every scene he's present. The film tells the story of James Donovan (Hanks), an American lawyer that is recruited by the CIA during the Cold War to help rescue a pilot (Austin Stowell) detained in the Soviet Union. It all begins with the discovery of a probable spy on our own soil Rudolf Abel (Rylance), who tests Donovan's profession and safety net. Academy Award winner Steven Spielberg brings many of his signature techniques to the spy tale. Tugging at the emotional heartstrings is an Olympic event at this juncture in his career, although not exactly hitting the mark the way it was intended. He frames his scenes with the same familiar authority that we've grown to love about Spielberg, and it definitely exceeds some of his lesser works like "War Horse" and "The Terminal." What the film truly lacks is a daring approach to its source material. Unfamiliar with the story and real life individuals, Spielberg, and the writers, Joel &amp; Ethan Coen and Matt Charman, don't enter the grit and horror of two countries at a feud, literally on the brink of a real devastating war. Tom Hanks brings his natural charisma and wit that we've loved about him for decades. His James Donovan is caring, engaging, and reminiscent of Atticus Finch in "To Kill a Mockingbird." His devotion to his family and the human condition is truly admirable, all clear and on display thanks to Hanks. As Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance is just a joy to behold, filling in the gaps of the film's shortcomings with charm and seasoned acting ability. It's a brilliant turn by a brilliant actor. It's one of the year's best supporting turns and a contender for the Oscar statue. As James' wife Mary, Amy Ryan is relegated to just a few scenes but great nonetheless. Also brief are the works of Billy Magnussen and Alan Alda, who have good, solid one scenes to chew on. Technically the film does present qualms. Janusz Kaminski's camera work is distracting in parts, shining bright lights through windows, and keeping a one note camera style all throughout its 135 minute run time. Thomas Newman's score isn't put to its best use, as it swells in inopportune moments, even managing to overwhelm a key and fantastic scene by Rylance. Michael Kahn cuts the film to a bloated expansive run time but manages to keep you involved enough to make it through. The film really shines in its Production Design by Adam Stockhausen and its Costume work by Kasia Walicka-Maimone. "Bridge of Spies" may find lovers in mass audiences. What it does well is ignite a curiosity and power to look at the history of its subject. Spielberg succeeds at introducing the world to James Donovan and what else he contributed to society, along with the supporting players at hand. We do wish that a better, more dynamic treatment had hit the screens. From an awards standpoint, it's going to appeal to a great deal. Perhaps a second viewing will open up more possibilities.greatly condensed and more tightly intertwined Hanks gives a very satisfying, watchable and assured performance, with just the right amount of hokum, homely and wily in judiciously balanced proportions,Because this is Hanks we're dealing with, audiences know what to expect. it's terrific craftsmanship, pure storytelling gusto and that Midas- touch ability to find grounds for optimism everywhere, Steven Spielberg has dramatised a true-life cold war spy-swap drama, starring Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. Those brought up on John Le Carré might perhaps expect from this moral equivalence, shabby compromise and exhausted futility. But Spielberg, with his gift for uncynicism, uncovers decency and moral courage amidst all the Realpolitik. He works from an excellent screenplay by up-and-coming British dramatist Matt Charman, a script punched up in recognisable places by Joel and Ethan Coen.Great Performances and Good Drama Bridge of Spies (2015)  *** (out of 4) Attorney James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is given the thankless job of defending suspected Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Donovan accepts the job but soon finds himself defending his client a bit too good for some, which leads to him being the main negotiator between America and Russia when it comes time for a prisoner swap. Steven Spielberg's BRIDGE OF SPIES isn't one of the director's greatest works but it's certainly a very well-made film that manages to hold your attention throughout the rather long running time. I must admit that the trailer for the film really left me cold so I wasn't sure what to expect from the film but overall it's another good movie from the director, although the ending falls into that cringe-worthy, over-sentimental stuff that the director does quite often. With that said, there's no doubt that there's a highly good story being told here that grabs your attention and doesn't let it go. The screenplay by Joel &amp; Ethan Coen and Matt Charman does a very good job at capturing the spirit of the period and even if you're not familiar with the Cold War the film does a nice job at bringing you up to speed on the various fears. Spielberg perfectly handles the material and milks it for some nice drama as well as some political points that are certainly meant to be taken into consideration on some current issues. Hanks, as you'd expect, turns in an excellent performance and is certainly believable in the role of the attorney who finds his life spinning out of control from not only his wife but strangers who feels he is helping a spy. Hanks is such a calm grace that it really was entertaining just seeing him negotiate. Rylance also deserves a lot of credit for the way he played this character and I really loved the laid back approach to where the character never tips his cap in regards to what and who he really is. Technically speaking the film is quite good and of high standards. BRIDGE OF SPIES could have been a bit tougher on the political aspects but it's goal was to aim for the mainstream and in the end it's an entertaining film.Fascinating but a bit long One of the most interesting movies I have seen so far this year.  My only criticism was that it was just a tad too long and began to drag when Donovan was in Berlin trying to negotiate the prisoner exchange. It is definitely a movie for history buffs rather than people seeking a shoot 'em up, blow 'em up action movie. The characters of Abel and Donovan are both well developed. The historical settings are rich and enjoyable. People sensitive to Hollywood making fun of American culture may be upset by the portrayal of CIA operatives as descendants of the Keystone CopsThis is what real spies looks like This is one of only a few spy movies i happened to see in 2015. I have seen most of Steven Spielberg movies. Some of them i liked more than others. He created horror, adventure, mystery, fantasy, comedy genre movies. But his strongest movies are the ones about history. Bridge of spies is about a lawyer who gets in a dangerous politics game of spies between USA and USSR. I gotta say this movie is not adventure movie so if you are waiting for lots of action and shooting and running, forget it. But if you want to see a good realistic spy movie that shows what spies looks like in a real world this movie is a must. Again Tom Hanks performed perfectly. Directing, screenplay and cameraman job is done with highest standards. The only weak spot i would think of is it gets too sentimental at times. But who has seen Steven Spielberg movies, knows he does it a lot. I totally recommend this movie for history, real life events based movie lovers.Excellent espionage movie Against the backdrop of immensely popular TV Shows such as The Americans &amp; Deutschland 83, Bridge of Spies holds its own ground and showcases a masterpiece to the audience, thanks to the incredible duo - Steven Spielberg &amp; Tom Hanks. It seems they can do no wrong and this movie makes them one of the top collaborators in Hollywood.  As for the movie, its not especially intense as compared to other high octane spy thrillers, but shows a lighter and more delicate version of the cold war era politics, with focus on negotiation tactics employed by governments and their officials. Quick &amp; witty dialogues along with some great emotions displayed by the actors (Kudos to Mark Rylance) makes it one of the best movies to watch in 2015.Classic American Propaganda Beside the good acting of Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, there isn't many good things about this movie. Tom Hanks appears as a symbol of 'great' America, doing the right things one after another, even though the authorities are against it (like it is possible for him to act so independent) to symbolize how 'great' is the US. On the other hand Soviets are the evils as usual. Tortures against American soldier/spy, hostile military officers even against their own spy ( while American soldier does the exact opposite), scared children that got education at school about nuclear war (ironically with the footage of nuclear experiments that US did) and many other things that show how evil the Soviet was. But the American side had right causes to act unjust (not evil, just unjust) because they are patriots which is a good thing. To summarize, it is all about taking necessary dosage of American propaganda with some good acting.Liked this movie very much, except for one disturbing issue... I did not expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did, though as a child in the late 50's, the subject matter and terrifying school-based videos really struck a chord. The acting was also very good! I just have to note that I had a real problem with the comment wielded at Tom Hanks' character at the beginning of the movie by the CIA agent over a drink: "...don't go all Boy Scout on me..." No one would have said that in 1957 and there were a few other similar inconsistencies...annoying. This story is an important one to be told--the "cold war" was very real as children and downright frightening on a daily basis. It's important to get this message out to the younger audience.Great spy/legal/historical drama also good for families This is a great spy and legal drama on the exchange of spies during the cold war. I went to see it with the kids and they all liked it. The historical reconstruction (East Berlin in particular) is very realistic and the movie mixes very well "every day" life scenes with intense scenes. Tom Hanks played very well the unwilling soft spoken hero (Atticus Finch style). The stress that himself and his family had to bear is a tense part of the first half of the movie. The (almost) final scene when the family discovers his role in the exchange is a great masterpiece for me. Mark Rylance in the Soviet spy role is also a great supporting actor, so much like a stubborn, quiet grandfather working at the post office, and so much different from the "traditional Russian spy" (either half-naked lady or half-brained bully) to be entirely believable (and likable too). One of my kids knew the story from a spy history book and vouches for the accuracy of the details (minor issue is that the American spying plane pilot Powers seems a novice whilst he had several flights under his belly, but you can't have everything).Not much Interesting!!! Even though I am not American I found many interesting movies about history and biographical, but not this one. I went to this movie with great expectation of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks and the rating given for the movie, but the movie was below my expectation. I don't find ,much mystery,twist,thriller or interesting drama.  The movie was just going on towards successful deal. The opposite parties involved in the negotiation with Tom Hanks are approving for all his demands after every second attempt. All looks very less complicated negotiations.Over hyped may be because of entities shown in the film are big or because of I already read about the incident depicted in the movie. But still there are many movies you will tend to watch again and again even though you read the story and watched already, this one not up to that level. The role given for Tom Hanks is just a piece of cake for him. Movie may be interesting to the audience who obsessed with that true events. Not for me.. sorry!!'Bridge of Spies': A Cold Fight The montage of 'Bridge of Spies' is loaded with narratively significant match cuts. Those are reminiscent of the ironically great cut in 'Catch Me If You Can' where the shot of a girl saying "no, no ..." in surprise is harshly cut into "yes, yes ..." being yelled by the same girl while having intercourse consequently. It's useful to compare them with the pretentious, nonfunctional, so- called innovative jump cuts of Goddard's. Hitchcock once explained that cutting "should be called assembly.  Montage means the assembly of pieces of film which, moved in rapid succession before the eye, create an idea." Spielberg surely have thoroughly comprehended the notion.  As far as I've noticed, each sequence is in a narratively significant dialogue with the ones surrounding it. Such dialogue is also aesthetical. For instance, there is a seemingly tranquil sequence, where Donovan is meeting the spy in confinement, preceded by an aggressively disruptive sequence - following the sentence being declared in the courtroom - and proceeding to a the scene where Donovan's house is being shot. This reminds me of the contrast characteristic of montage once explained by Hitchcock. The movie is also loaded with dark, fiendish ironies (again, reminiscent of 'Catch Me If You Can' to an extent) delicately embodied by Tom Hanks. The picture is full of good deeds, being done by the typecast Hanks, and some kind of patriotism which is so recurrent in Spielberg's works. Such extent of these characteristics are not appealing to me. Nonetheless, they've done their works so appropriately and elaborately that I can't help enjoying them! I get filled with the tremendous, yet not corny, melodramatic atmosphere the director builds up. One remarkable reason why it doesn't feel corny is that he demonstrates even the (so-to-say) villain in a perceptive manner. It is notable, as a recurrent element - and therefore a privilege from the auteurism point of view - that his typical protagonist is neither a hero nor a villain but he's somewhere in the middle. It should be also wisely noticed that such middle state is not caused by the character's (or indeed filmmakers') inability to possess a clear status but by his absolutely firm and self-assured status which isn't predominantly accepted. Take for instance Hanks's role as a purely professional lawyer in this movie, his role as an arguably hardboiled cop – albeit not the protagonist - in 'Catch Me If You Can', Lincoln firmly believing in one simple principle in 'Lincoln' and Schindler as a mere industrialist in 'Schindler's List'. From a more detailed point of view, what matters to his protagonists is not the right or wrong but is (their) principles. For instance, Donovan, in this picture, believes in his job - and its principles - to such extent that even the Soviet spy, being defended by him, cautions "Jim ... you should be careful. Careful!"  Another privilege of Spielberg's over these contemporary, pretentious directors is his precise perception and elaborate fulfillment of complication and complexity. This picture, as an excellent example, features tens of instances of complication, in situations and interactions, which are likely to capture an audience's mind to such extent that it would reinforce the narrative and convey the suspense and thrill to the audience much more effectively. Such mature director is completely in contrast to the directors aforementioned. Take the highly cherished director, Nolan, for example. He's used to complicating his works so much that not only he, but perhaps anyone, can do. However, what he – and that anyone naturally – is unable to do is finishing up the narrative with any given degree of complication it's loaded with. He just abandons the narrative in a nondescript point.  There are two narratives constituting the story which, interestingly enough, while interacting with each other, gradually build up the political condition of the day too. It just caught my undivided attention how a cold fight, magnificently representing the Cold War, was demonstrated throughout the last sequences of the film – not to mention it's there throughout the movie with varying degrees. Throughout those final sequences, Donovan is involved in an outrageous fight where everyone is fully attempting to prove their power. It is literally a cold fight. It employs no muscle but is absolutely detrimental and nerve-wrecking.  The Cold War, naturally, had a cold side to it, signifying you couldn't know what's to come for sure. However, it was extraordinarily hot. Living in the day, while bombarded by propagandas suggesting a horrible war could begin at any time, one would be overwhelmed, distressed and, in all, superfluously confident. Such state of tremendously firm presumptions regarding war, enemy and stuff like that is fabulously suggested by the blinding lights throughout the movie. In most cases, light is dreadfully dark in this movie, making it arguably a groundbreaking neo-noir. Such lighting suggests the sense of assurance in the confinement and incarceration scenes too; this time implying Donovan and the spy being assured of their professional principles, which is what's common between them, as the glamorous gleam in their background is. His employment of technology, unlike most of Hollywood directors' exploitation of technology, actively induces my analytic enjoyment. Finally, the amphiboly in the title of the picture caught my eyes. Bridge has two meanings here. Its second meaning, medium/facilitator, is Donovan himself who, at the peak of the movie, ends up at a bridge (the first meaning) bridging the spies. And you see a final touch in the end of the sequence where everyone leaves the situation rapidly and all the lights are turned off but Donovan stays. And ultimately, the aerial long shot – featuring only Donovan and the bridge – implies the amphiboly in the title, 'Bridge of Spies'.  So far as I've watched Spielberg's works, along with 'Catch Me If You Can', this one of his have best appealed to me. PS. Spielberg-Hanks, undoubtedly, is one the functionally greatest duo in filmmaking.Spielberg shows us a simpler, humaner side of the Cold-War era I should start by saying that this movie really moved me - in a way that I truly didn't expect it to. As the end credits rolled I found myself in soft tears, something I almost never do.  Maybe it's the setting, I was expecting a spy movie packed with intense dialogue or maybe even chases here and there... I was so wrong and for the better of it. Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor and he plays the role of a simple lawyer being dragged into an unfamiliar situation with a huge amount of confidence and bravery. He fights for what he believes is right and plays both sides ( the Germans and the Russians) perfectly. I love his line in the end "It doesn't matter what people think, you know what you did." Make no mistake, this is a human drama with all the best elements of a spy story. The acting by both Hanks and Rylance is great, Mr. Mark is a pleasure to watch and I don't think that anyone could have played the role of the soviet spy better than he did. There is something in his eyes and the way he talks, it just pins you down and you just have to focus on him. Of course, the camera work in the movie is excellent and it really puts you right inside the action - especially in the second part of the movie.Engaging, Entertaining and very Hollywood A well acted movie with catchy dialog. Too often though, it sounds like punch lines being delivered. "I'm not afraid to die....Then the punchline...but it wouldn't be my first choice." Unfortunately it was meant to please not give the story any depth. At the end of the film you know nothing about, nor care about, the characters other than what was minimally needed to move the story. Just for the record, all the women are minor characters. You really don't have an idea about the relationship between the Tom Hanks character and his wife. Refreshingly, there no guns, girls or chase scenes and yet the movie is engaging. Tom Hanks is the anti James Bond.One of my favorites this year Steven Spielberg made it again, yet another historic film that is actually pretty well made, it is such an excellent film and a surprise as well since I had no idea the Coen Bros worked on the screenplay until I saw the credits. The first hour was a bit slow with all the setting and dialog, it gets much better in the second one. The events in the second half were pivotal and the political complexities Tom Hanks found himself mired in were essential to the plot, at the second hour the film was starting to get my interest in a way that I could'nt turn away from it. It is a terrific Spielberg picture, there were some great performances by both actors leading and supporting, i hope that Mark Rylance gets the Oscar, I would've like to see Tom Hanks get a nomination as well but it is what it is. Thank you for reading.American Justice system on trial A good suspense Cold War movie about civilian lawyer, James B. Donovan, who negotiates the release of U2 spy plane pilot Gary Powers and American foreign exchange student Frederic Pryor for KGB mole agent Rudolf Abel. Both lawyer James B. Donovan and KGB agent Rudolf Abel had a very interesting careers in real history. It's well worth reading about them. There was also a lot of cloak and dagger/duck and cover tension drama in this movie. Should we the American people follow the typical lynch mob mentality and hang foreign agent Rudolf Abel or should we let the justice system take its course? Otherwise we would be no different than the Kangaroo courts that the Soviets would set up if they capture one of our agents. That is the question lawyer James Donovan debates about with his peers, his family, and the American public he encounters on the street before U2 pilot Gary Powers gets shot down by S.A.M.'s. This movie is Stephen Spielberg and Tom Hanks at their best. It will probably be an instant classic for years to come.'It doesn't matter what others think. You know what you did.' The setting for this based on a true story film is the 10950s – that tense period when in America children were put through classroom drills in case of an expected (or rather, feared) nuclear attack form Russia. Most people had bomb shelters stocked with supplies for the propaganda response that the Cold War ruled everyone's thinking. Remember those days? If not then this film will most assuredly force you to stare at the anxiety that ruled the politics and the military and the populace during that awful time. Steven Spielberg directs a script created by the Coen Brothers and Matt Charman and has engaged a splendid cast that offers many insights into the thinking of that period. The story (for those who are shaky on facts and dates) is as follows: 'In the cold war, an insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), who hasn't practiced criminal law since he was a prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials after World War II, is recruited by the CIA and involved in an intense negotiation mission to release and exchange a CIA U-2 spy-plane pilot, Francis G. Powers (Austin Stowell) who was arrested alive after his plane was shot down by the Soviet Union during a mission- with a KGB intelligence officer, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) who was arrested for espionage in the US. The strong anti- Communist mood at the time makes him a target from those (the general populace) who think Abel should just be executed. Abel is convicted but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence him to prison, rather than execute him, as they may at some point in the future want to swap him for an American spy the Soviets might have in custody. And of course Donovan's theory works, emphasizing the humanity that can resist fear of the unknown in the time of Cold War.  The cast is uniformly excellent with special kudos to Alan Alda, Sebastian Koch, Amy Ryan and of course Hanks and Rylance. Superb script, well re-enactment of an ugly part of our history, and some fine nuances about faith in the democratic system make this one of the finest films of the year.Another Spielberg-Hanks epic drama film I've been a fan of this duo since Saving Private Ryan, Catvh Me if You Can and also The Terminal. Steven Spielberg always makes the audience keep on the edge of their seats. Like me while watching this i am really excited on what will gonna happen next.  The movie is based on a real life lawyer James Donovan portrayed by Tom Hanks. As usual Tom Hanks gives another well acted performance just like in any other movies of him. Another actor that give great performance was Mark Rylance. I never heard of him only in this film and i am blown away with his portrayal of Rudolf Abel, his facial expression is great the acting of him really from the heart.  The movies is more on drama but it's thrilling. Some may say it's boring because of the lack of action scene. This is a drama film not an action film but you can feel intense the way the connection of the characters and the story about it.  Great acting, I love the cinematography, the atmospheric effect really feels like i was there on that certain period of time. Great directing by Steven Spielberg. Well written by the Coen brothers. I really love the way the movie was written there are some funny lines which i love the most. Like talking seriously and suddenly it changes from a little comedy. I will not spoil you about it.  This film will be nominated in some Oscar awards and it is indeed well deserve for this film.Slow as death - felt like a MOW/Docudrama. Little substance and Boring! I am a big fan of Spielberg and really had high expectations for this film. However, it was so slow moving that if it was not for the director name and Tom Hanks I would have walked out of it. Yes, you read that correctly. There was really nothing moving about the movie and the over saturated directing made it even worse. The main few events were played over and over so much that the end of the story felt blaise. Great material and wonderful that it is a true story but it was the most shallow slow moving boring docudrama and I love history but I would not recommend or waste any money on this movie. I give it a 1 star and the worst movie Spielberg has made.
