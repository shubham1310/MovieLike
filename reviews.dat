A virtual scene by scene steal of episode IV but without the originality Some say that there are only three original stories, some say five and some say seven. In the case of the Star Wars franchise this is patently NOT true; instead we get the same old story churned out seven times in seven progressively worse parodies of what was, in it's day, an original film. In this new version we have a somewhat badly drawn and remarkably underwhelming universe in which a bunch of hardly memorable characters set out to recreate a simple rewrite of most of episode IV - but with somewhat better special effects. To say that you could see what was coming from scene one is understating the utter predictability of the story, but perhaps Mr Abrams decided that predictability would magically make the characters readily recognisable, thereby eliminating the need for character development. This lack of character depth made it impossible to engage with them in any memorable way, it also made the romantic interest very uninteresting and highly unbelievable. Although it is a somewhat cringe-worthy production, it is just about watchable.Yet another Jar Jar Abrams abortion When I saw what the idiot Abrams did to Star Trek, I was furious. When I learned that he was going to direct the latest Star Wars movie, I knew exactly what would be the result; a total abortion of a great franchise, just as he did Star Trek. Abrams once again shows his true colors by exploiting the work of someone else, and then totally destroying it. Abrams philosophy is "All we have to do is take the original movie, change a few character names, and then put it up as a new GREAT IDEA." Sorry, it doesn't work this time.  In a horrible rip off of the first Star Wars movie that premiered in 1977, Abrams takes EVERY plot idea, relies on Disney marketing to hype the movie to death, and then delivers a total failure of a movie complete with horrible actors (Harrison Ford is the exception) and trying to rely on effects to say, "Hey, look what I can do!" A few highlights: CAUTION: MAJOR SPOILER ALERT, however Abrams spoiled the movie before I wrote this review. During a storm trooper invasion a map was hidden in R2 Rolie Polie and pursued by the bad guys. During a storm trooper invasion, plans were hidden in R2-D2 and pursued by the bad guys.

A group of rebel forces flies down a trench in order to shoot at the death star's weakness and destroy it. R2-D2 and 3PO had NO meaning in the movie at all. Their appearances were only there to be able to say that they've been in all Star Wars movies Luke Skywalker finally shows up at the end of the movie, which was the obsession of the stupid plot, only to say NOTHING, but stare at the girl attempting to hand him his light saber. The movie ended before we heard the phrase, "I am your father." I would have vomited all over the theater floor if this had come about. Why people hire, support or even give J.J. Abrams any kind of recognition is beyond me. He's a horrible director and total thief of classic work. This time however, he can't blame his stupidity on an "alternate time line" as he tried miserably in Star Trek.This trash makes no sense They forced Star Wars to return and as much as any film it makes no sense. Last we saw Star Wars the rebels won. No one bothered to tell director JJ Abrams. They are now rebels again. Luke is hiding and doesn't want to be found (but left a map behind anyway har har), but why? Don't think about it because there is no answer. Bad acting, bad or no characters and typical remake problems. Just the choice of JJ Abrams shows you what Disney intended to do: take money and return deliver less than zero. IMDB, why can't we give a zero?Cover version This movie was like one of those tribute bands playing cover versions on the nostalgia circuit. You feel as if you have seen and heard the original and much better version and this is just a replica and a fake. Why would be surprised though? Disney is famed for having no talent. How many versions of, Hunchback Of Notre Dame, Captain America, Bambi, etc etc. has this company churned out? Yup, so why should they now start to create something new or exciting now? To make matters worse, the cash hounds did not notice that: No one can magically master the force in a day... No one can simply scan the cosmos and find a space ship just like that (er, space is like er you know kinda big place) The troopers are clones and are all alike so no one cannot be black and just for fun here is another one: on a raid and assault to retrieve plans (see I told you it is a rip off) you do not take a sewage cleaner soldier with you... Fine, you got the leading girl, the black trooper and the cute robot (now available at authorized dealers, outlets and websites for purchase...costing you $$ even though they are Made in China and cost 3 cents to produce) but for me four things come to mind: I am boycotting Disney going forward. That is right, you can call it Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar whatever I am out. I am boycotting JJ 'Master Hack' Abrams and producers Tommy Harper and Ben Rosenblatt going forward for being money hungry dream destroying douches and finally will never ever again trust the media and reviewers again. You are all exposed as frauds.Disney's Hype Wars Won. Star Wars Did Not - A Safe Corporate Exercise In Entertainment. Following the mass-marketing campaign extraordinaire, I truly was fooled into believing this was a fantastic movie before I saw it. I believed the hype, that this was a Star Wars returned to form.....It is not!  Story-wise it falls short of the prequels, never mind the original films. It truly is a Disney Star Wars. It's an almost sickeningly safe corporate exercise in entertainment with none of the original edge &amp; flare/excitement. The original was based on old Saturday morning swash-buckling matin√©e series, with heroes &amp; beautiful heroines. This Star Wars gave us a flat-chested car mechanic who looks like a teenage choirboy, a ham-acting ex-storm-trooper &amp; Princess Leia re-imagined as a General. It's just soulless &amp; flat &amp; scared of its own shadow!  Basically they've taken the original story, sucked all the sexiness out of it &amp; punched &amp; squeezed it into a corporate 'Disney' box. All stories must have accessibility, they must allow you to buy into the imaginings &amp; in this 'The Force Awakens' fails miserably as it has hacked clumsily away at the origin story to suit its new safe Disney Star Wars universe. Booo!JJ Abrams needs to quit Just awful is all I can say. A sanitation storm trooper,, who was at a invasion? A sanitation storm trooper who knows how to sword fight? Just clueless. I did not like this at all, my children did not like this, my grandma did not like this, Time lines seem to not fit, we got a old princess lea, but the technology hasn't been improved, or the old craft has not been upgraded to new technology. The found the falcon on a junk planet, but yet it's fully operational after 40 years, do they have eternal power sources, i don't think so. The end of the show was even more worthless, Luke was on what appears to be earth? and on a island in the middle of the ocean with no food or water or shelter. lololmao. Things must be getting pretty desperate in Lollywood for them to be pumping out this garbage.A Cinematic Travesty I will never forget seeing Star Wars Episode IV for the first time in 1977. What an awesome film it was. I've been a fan of the Star Wars universe ever since. It was with great excitement I watched the latest episode VII. As usual the movie began with the scrolling text laying out the current scenario. Already at this point it seemed a bit weak and very similar to previous plots. It did not take long to begin predicting what would happen in many of the scenes. I often blurted out to my family, "don't tell me they're going to copy that scene from (insert scene from other episode) here." My wife would say "Oh no, they would do that." They did! I was able to predict events and even dialogue nearly verbatim because the movie continually reused the twists and turns of previous installments. My wife who is also a Star Wars fan agreed wholeheartedly with my ho-hum reaction. Our son (also a fan) left less than 30 minutes in. I won't go into all the details of how the movie stole so much from the previous films as you can surely read them in other reviews. I wanted so much to enjoy and love this movie as I did all the others, but honestly it was boring. Whereas I've watched each of the previous Star Wars films numerous times, I seriously doubt I will ever waste two hours watching this one again. I can't imagine how it was possible to take such a fantastic imaginative story like Star Wars and make it this boring. How is it possible that not one new idea sprang up in someones mind in the ten years since the last episode? There was no character development to speak of either. I really can't think of one takeaway from this film that would be beneficial to watching any future episode either. Dull, unimaginative, and boring best describes the movie. I'm a little upset that more was not done with the opportunity to add to such a brilliant legacy. I'm not sure what JJ. Abrams was thinking and I can't understand how George Lucas allowed this cinematic travesty.  I have never been so disappointed in a movie before. Edited to add: I have now gone and read some of the other reviews here. It seems that EVERY review I saw is rated 1 out of 10 with the odd 4 or 5, so how is it possible this movie has an 8.3 average??? Something smells odd here.The IMDb rating is mighty fishy... I wouldn't have taken the time nor the effort to post a written review of this movie were it not for the suspiciously inflated IMDb score of 8.5. Curious, I scrolled through the first 20 PAGES of reviews and counted exactly 5 positive ones. The many negative reviews gave it one star explicitly to balance out the ridiculous score it now has overall.  I will do the same and I urge everyone else who gave it 5 stars or less to amend your review and give it a one star rating instead. The IMDb books are cooked. I'm not a conspiratorial person by nature but with so much money at stake I have to believe that the House of Mouse might have had something to do with it.  At any rate I would honestly rate it a 6 out of 10. But my sense of fair play bids me give it only one star.Didn't expect much, was still disappointed. This movie was exactly what I expected it to be. A safe, unimaginative, nostalgia-filled cash grab. I cant exactly blame Disney or Abrams for taking the safe route after the backlash Lucas got for attempting to do something new, but I was still surprised at exactly how safe they decided to stay. Nearly everything is a rehash of episode 4. Same plot, same characters, same factions, even another death star. There is a painful lack of exposition. Nothing is explained about the state of the galaxy or what happened after episode 6. The viewer is not told what the New Republic is, not told what the First Order is, what the motivations of either party are, who Rey is or why she so good at everything. I know this is the first in a new trilogy, but that doesn't excuse bad writing in this movie. There is zero world building. Even the musical score is lackluster, something I figured for impossible in a Star Wars movie. For all the hate he gets, Lucas was a master world builder. I genuinely enjoyed the machinations of Palpatine within the Senate, the political scheming of the trade federation, and the build up to the start of the Clone Wars. It made the Star Wars universe seem so real seeing a functioning government and the power struggles within it. Abrams' entry in the series is devoid of all of that context. And the lesser for it. I was seriously surprised at the lack of criticism the is movie received in the days and weeks after its release. Star Wars fans ripped into every. single. little. flaw. in the prequels, yet this movie was getting a pass on major deficiencies. I even went out to see it two more times just to make sure I wasn't missing any hidden dialogue or bits of exposition. Nope.  Even now, nearly a year after its release, its still being called the best Star Wars movie by many people. I don't understand it. Star Wars is supposed to be a fantasy series, and maybe I'm wrong, but world building and exposition are supposed to be important parts of fantasy writing. How the movie with arguably the least exposition and world building is being hailed as the best is beyond me. Bottom line: This a decent action movie, but a sub par Star Wars movie.Disney Sponsored Fan Fiction. The Force Awakens Is A Disgraceful Example Of Corporate Filmmaking. For those praising this film,  Star Wars Episode 7 is a despicable corporate product of a movie, that leeches off the imagination of the man who created its universe, while simultaneously giving him a giant middle finger by erasing all remnants of his Prequel Trilogy and turning the franchise into a vehicle for pandering fan service and a "progressive", feminist agenda.  Episode 7 is nothing but glorified fan fiction made by a corporation desperate to get a return on their investment. With years of careful risk-benefit analysis, they were able to produce a film that upset the least amount of the rabid, vicious "original fan base" as possible. So "fans", you got everything you wanted. George Lucas, and the prequels are but a memory and you get all your original toys back, with just enough new crap to fool you into thinking your experiencing something fresh. You'll see the next 20 Star Wars movies and you'll get everything you begged to have, but you'll never be surprised.  When Lucas wrote the script for A New Hope, he wasn't trying to please anyone but himself. He wasn't feeding a hungry mob everything they wanted, he was crafting a story that he wanted to see told on film. After 6 great chapters, he finished his story. So enjoy Disney's Star Wars movies until the end of time, but just remember that you're never going to see a film series so daring, ambitious, and above all, entertaining as George Lucas' Star Wars.  Now, onto the aspects of this travesty that I fundamentally stand against. 1. A Star Wars Movie Without George Lucas Is Not Star Wars  George Lucas didn't just have a part in the making of Star Wars, he CREATED it. Star Wars wasn't a collaboration that incorporated the imaginations of many different people. It wasn't an adaptation of someone else's work. Star Wars is solely the product of one man's imagination. Sure, tons of people worked on the films, but the entire Star Wars universe is George Lucas' vision. The uniqueness of Star Wars is that it all comes from the mind of one, incredibly creative man. Episodes 1-6 are the official Star Wars story as told by the man who created it. Any other story is, by definition, an imitation. Lucasfilm can try all they like to make these new movies look and feel like the real deal, but the truth of the matter is, they will never be the genuine article. Lucas' quirky touch is what makes Star Wars special. Without it, it's just another disposable sci-fi franchise.  2. Every Decision Was Made By A Corporation.   The Force Awakens is a focus-grouped, market researched, PRODUCT that reeks of corporate control. After acquiring Lucasfilm, Disney had this film made so they would make their money back and then some. Storytelling was absolutely secondary. And the conception of the film isn't the only glaringly obvious corporate decision in Episode 7. EVERY major decision in the film was overseen by Disney and Lucasfilm. The new characters in particular reek of corporate greed and agenda pushing. The main character is a female and the secondary characters are mostly played by women or minorities. Disney will champion these casting decisions as a progressive triumph, but the truth of the matter is that these new characters exist purely as a PR move. Congratulations, your SJW street cred is through the roof, but I will never support a movie that uses someone else's creation as a platform to help their brand.   3. It Panders To A Vocal Minority Of "Fans" It absolutely sickens me that this movie deliberately ignores and actively mocks the prequels. George Lucas spent 10 years of his life crafting those films, and millions of people loved them, but the executives at Lucasfilm and Disney were so afraid of the pathetic internet trolls that they became one themselves. All the marketing of "The movie you've been waiting for since 1983!", "It's all real!", "The magic is back!"... it's all a ploy to appease a vocal minority of sad losers that couldn't stand that Episodes 1,2, and 3 tried new things. Even the title of the movie is a shot at the prequels. "The Force Awakens", as if those 3 massively popular movies somehow put the force to sleep. Once again, all of these decisions are corporate based. As a result, we get a two hour apology tour. They hear people complain about dialogue, so everyone becomes an over-acting spunk machine. They hear people complain about politics, so they ax that aspect entirely. Basically, they hear people complain about the prequels, so they do everything possible to remove them from memory. "We hate George Lucas and the prequels too, see?" Because the vocal minority of whiners is more important than the majority of people who love Lucas' entire saga. It's almost shocking how disrespectful Lucasfilm has been to prequel fans and Lucas himself. Almost.  4. This Is A Troubling Sign Of Things To Come.   The Force Awakens ushers in an era of prostitution for the Star Wars name. With Episode 7, Disney has learned that they can make whatever they want, and as long they do exactly what the "fans" tell them, they'll have a cash cow that never dries up, and they'll never have anyone complain. After all, fans are getting everything they want, right? Well what about those of us that want to see NEW things? These corporations don't care about us. New ideas could upset people, so innovation loses over imitation. The Star Wars story ended in 2005. It's time for something new. Boycott the rest of Disney's Star Wars fan-fiction, and maybe we can prevent Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens from being the movie that killed the blockbuster. An abomination I put the spoiler alert... but there is little to spoil here. It's just something that should never have been filmed. It's my fault, a friend of mine warned me. And I remember I didn't care, "it's Star Wars, I even enjoyed the I, II, III... When I see the logo and the music starts... they should really try very hard to ruin it for me. What can they do so bad?" Well... They destroy everything Star Wars was about: The Force as a mystical thing? Now it's just "superpowers", and you don't need to train. You have them, that's all. And even a spoiled brat with daddy issues has, sometimes, more powers than Yoda or Palpatine... Of course, only sometimes. Sense? None. They go for a map to find a guy that run away (and for some reason left a map???) and the reason is... is... why is that important to find him? Specially when there is a new Death Star to be destroyed? No reason at all. Because it's Luke. That's it. Dark side vs Light side? Now, the "new heroin" beats the bad guy without any training, because she's really angry. I guess, in some place, Palpatine was laughing "yes, use your anger"... But in this new Star Wars is OK, she has superpowers, that's all. You don't need calm to control the Force and, in fact, it's the bad guy who gets tempted by the light side... WTH??????? Consistency with TRotJ? If the Rebels won, shouldn't the "bad guys" be the new "rebels"? No, they are pretty much the Empire. What happened? Why? Don't expect any answer in the flick. Somebody told me it's supposed to be explained somewhere. I don't care. If you need web pages or books just to explain the main plot of a movie, that movie is really bad storytelling. Period. Great villains? (Vader, Maul, Palpatine...) Now the villain is a kid with anger control and daddy issues, some pathetic little kid not even stormtroopers respect. They give them more "superpowers" than Yoda and Palpatine together, they made him kill the most iconic Star Wars character, just to try to make him look bad-ass... And yet, you just want to ask him for him lunch money. Just pathetic. The character and the effort of Abrams to make him charismatic. The first time we saw Vader he just walked, looked around... and we knew you shouldn't mess with him. No need for superpowers. That's called being "charismatic". This guy is the new Jar Jar, but worst. Jar Jar wasn't meant to be scary. And stupid. The poor guy wants to be like Vader... The same Vader that saved the day at the end of the OT and ended up being a good guy???? That Vader???? Adventures? as we already know the plot of the movie... not so much. Great settings? A desert. Woodlands. That's all. Even if you didn't like the episodes I, II, III, you have things to enjoy: Naboo, Coruscant... Here... NOTHING. No new design to awe you. TIES, X- Wings... that's all. The Galaxy just got really, really small. The first minutes, with the Star Destroyers in the desert, are OK. The rest... I could only thing "please, I really want this to end already". It felt like a 10 hour movie to me. The only thing OK was Solo and we all know how that ended... My brain just couldn't understand why the Star Wars music was in this B-Rate bad pilot for a TV series. And the worst of all, when it ended... The silence in the cinema. And i felt... dirty, but emotionally flat. I don't feel anger towards the movie or Abrams. I didn't feel anything. With the pass of the weeks I ended up feeling something: sadness. I really can't understand why people with half a brain can say this is not a disgrace and even argue is one of the best. I really can't. For me... it's just the end. I'll enjoy the first 6 movies and try to forget this disgrace. I really felt dirty when the movie finished. Disney can forget about my money. And I write this several weeks after wasting my money for this... thing.Star Wars The Force Awoken Review I have just watched the film after weeks or being too nervous .  After the 30 minutes of franchise related adverts ,the trailers started .A constant flow of good vs evil franchise films starting with London has Fallen ,Captain America ,Civil War, Star Trek ,X- men .  Seriously this constant flow of formulaic drivel has become laughable .Time to try something different perhaps .  The new characters in the film all seemed very light weight ,there was no real character development at all for Finn . I didn't appreciate the way that every significant character seemed to just bump into each other regardless of where they landed .  The discovery of the LightSabre was also a very questionable scene .  Another criticism was the situation between Leia ,Han and their son now choosing to work for the evil Empire . They seemed to accept the situation a little too easily for my liking .  The acting of Domhnall Gleeson was pantomime camp .  The scene where Rey discovers her powers and then uses then was atrocious .  The scene showing the death of Han was over thought and you could see the outcome from a mile off .  The obsession with Death Star Super weapons was boring and the usual split action scene of space battle / significant character battle really has become an over used clich√© .  I never enjoyed one scene in the whole film .  I am truly broken hearted ,and what the hell was that final scene of Rey holding a light sabre and Luke facing her .It was nothing more than a scene devised for an 80s style flyover scene reminiscent of Clash of the Titans (original).  My rating 2/10Here is a joke: JJ Abrams! This huckster is the shining example of all that is wrong with Hollywood. Zero talent, zero entertainment value, zero creativity and definitely no artistic integrity. Actually if he ever reads this interview he will laugh out loud. He thinks all these concepts are dated. All he cares about is cash and remaking and rebooting. No wonder he is either called Mr Rip off or Jar Jar Abrams. He and Disney fit one another.  RIP Star Wars.The Force Falls Asleep Well I finally went to see the movie, with a total of 5 others in the theater! As I feared, the force has fallen asleep. This was pathetic as I kept seeing the same story, the same roles, doing the same things and everything else as it was before. Heck, even the animated chess board on the Millennium Falcon was activated (and probably right back to where it was left 30 years ago)! OMG is this the best they could come up with? Really? Hiding underneath the floor/deck in the MF, is that all they can think up? Oh but hey, the MF has a new radar dish on it, rectangular shaped vs round...30 years allowed for that significant advancement. The XWing fighters are still the same, after 30 years? Even the US Air Force upgrades to better technology in 30 years. Even the alien band playing looked very familiar in the dark caf√©/club....Where was the Rancour? (sp?). Even an evil alien there transmitting 'top secret' information...oh so boring, boring! We have a masked bad guy with dark powers and all the rest... Really! OMG this was boring and painful to watch. The movie previews for other movies before this sleepy rehash were more interesting! And a big cavern/hole for someone to fall down into... I guess Han Solo/HF said kill me please, I can't take this same old drama again after 30 years. I could go on and on, and I'm sure it's all been covered by other reviewers but at least I have said my part. JJ, a major disappointment, pathetic that this is all you could come up with. And Mark Hamill/LS didn't even say a word, how silly. I won't be buying this on BluRay and I won't bother to see the next movie. Yawn, the force is putting me to sleep, darn mitochondria (sp?) are acting up again, laughing at me for spending money to see the same old over again!This movie made me never believe critics again All the critics and professional reviewers loved this movie and gave it great reviews, but now that I watch this film it is a rip off of the original and much much much better film. Yes it copies and traces the lines of the original 1977 classic. Desert planet, cute robot and all without the good acting or directing of course. From a marketing perspective it is brilliant. Those knock off Apple Stores in China get shut down and do not last. How did this film make cash and get in the Top 250 of IMDb? More payola? Disney and the director must be ashamed and retired forever. I would boycott them from this day. But do not forget the professional payola writers who like anything they are told to like shame.The Farce Awakens   -  "I find your lack of vision... disturbing." Intro crawler &amp; Star Wars fanfare.  Opening scene - cut to a Star Destroyer in orbit above a planet. We then meet one of our heroes as they attempt to escape &amp; evade an attack from stormtroopers.  Our hero however is unsuccessful &amp; is instead captured by the dark lord &amp; his troops. Before being captured however, they manage to secret information vital to the resistance within their loyal droid. This droid is then tasked with reaching the resistance where this information will be retrieved. The droid sets off aimlessly across the wastelands of a harsh desert planet, pursued by a garrison of stormtroopers intent on finding it asap.  The droid is however captured first by a small statured scavenger of this planet, but is soon liberated by our main hero - a young desert wanderer and cunning pilot, who dreams of a brighter future. Meanwhile the dark forces have constructed a new technological terror. A super weapon so devastating, it can destroy entire planets with one blast of its mighty cannon.  Our female hero is captured by the dark lord, held prisoner &amp; interrogated within this new super weapon. But, with the aid of Han Solo &amp; Chewbacca, a daring rescue mission is staged which combines an attack on the shield generators of this super weapon. Cue a shock father/son epiphany and stand off within its chasmic interior. Following the defeat of the shield generator, a glorious X-Wing attack is staged (incorporating a hazardous trench run against enemy laser turrets and Tie Fighters) The planet sized super weapon is quickly defeated &amp; the X-Wing fleet escape the engulfing catastrophe.  Does any of this sound familiar? You would be forgiven for thinking that I have just described Episode IV! But sadly not. Daisy Ridley was an excellent choice as Rey. Kylo Ren amounted to a 2-dimensional teenager throwing tantrums, who removes his mask at anyone's request. General Hux was a painfully diluted character, bearing no more malice than a mild cold. And Captain Phasma? Was there really any point? George Lucas did it all before and better in the 1970's and was original at the same time.Been There, Done That **SPOILER ALERT** **SPOILER ALERT**  Wow, this movie was an identical to is predecessors... nothing new here Check list:  Young Jedi on a desert plant - Check!    Death star - Check!    Resistance pilot flying through the tunnel to destroy the death star - Check!    Crappy robot with secret message - Check!    Han Solo - Check!   Evil dude covered with black mask - Check!  But what really annoys me, is that a young Jedi who 30 minutes ago thought that The Force is a myth and Luke is a legend learned how to use the force in 1 day and defeats the evil masked guy who is training in the force his entire life....Star wars : The copy awakens Why o why after almost 40 years is the same exact movie recreated as the one from 1977 ? This so called blockbuster is an exact copy of episode 4 with little bits from 5 thrown in to fill the 2 hour running time. Even the soundtrack is more or less the same. I can understand the fans wanting something that securely sits in the star wars universe, but a 100% exact copy ? What is the point of this movie, what is its audience ? Most people, even the kids, will have seen the original many many times on TV, in home cinemas or on the small screen that's in front of you in tourist class when flying long haul, there is no need for a copy. Really annoying is the political correctness in this movie, here we have a black main character and a Hispanic side kick, of course all the evil is done by white men, so the Asians are missing , so you can be sure that the replacement for a character that's killed off in this episode will pop up next time and be Asian, o my. Near the end of the movie i found myself shouting "look at the size of this thing !", but not in an amused , but rather annoyed way. If you like things being blown up, stormtroopers still missing everyone with their "Peeew peeew" blasters and gender neutral toilets, go see it ! Otherwise just look at episode 4 yet again.Did not feel like Star Wars Here is a list of why this movie blows and why it didn't feel like Star Wars. 1. There was to much forced comedy with Finn, Poe, Solo, and Kylo Ren. Keep it simple with just BB-8.  2. Poe takes out 10 Tie Fighters and 2 stormtroopers within 10 seconds in his X-wing. Not even Wedge can do that. This ruined the whole movie for me.  3. Poe talks about how Tie Fighters can "really move" when he's flying one but then he is able to fly circles around them in his X-wing.  4. Kylo Ren uses force stasis on blaster bolts. Force Stasis only works on people, not blasters bolts. 5. No call signs for pilots. In this movie they were Cowboys in space. Not once they say, for example "This is Red-5."  6. Finn is able to take on a Sith lord, without dying. A trooper fighting a Sith lord would not be able to hold their ground, but Finn did.  7. A remake of A New Hope. 8. I love John Williams but the musical score was kind of weak.  9. C-3P0 has a red arm. Why? And why does he have 2 gold arms at the very end? lol No explanation.  10. Rey uses Jedi Mind trick on a stormtrooper and she has never been trained to use the force. Enough said.Use the Schwarz, J.J.! .. after Mel Brooks in Spaceballs. J.J.Abrams should have stuck to something he does not kill. The Force in this case. If there would be justice, this movie would never have been created due to copyright infringement. Except that those rich enough can buy up anything, strip it from the essential values and present a much worse version, erasing the past. The original from 77' was a classic: reinvention of the sci-fi genre, storyline, visuals, morality. This one was obviously hyped by global branding worthy of the 21st century. And that's exactly the issue: a 10 for marketing, but a mediocre 6 for the actual product, the movie, which in my book means a 2, just to pull the odds straight on a fair voting result. Here's the why: 1. Storyline: an EXACT copy of Episode 4, the first Star Wars movie ever made! Poor hero(ine) coincidentally meets droid that holds plan that is key to master plan - meet Han Solo / Chewbacca - meet forces of good ‚Äì fighting forces of evil where black-masked prime-evil guy turns out to be family member ‚Äì while fighting evil dude on bridge, planet-sized planet-destroying machine needs to be destroyed, before it erases all the good guys - fighter plane fight after disabling shielding device - shooting in tunnel - last-minute destruction of monstrosity by hitting it with a few loose guns at its core, which is practically unprotected. Everything is EXACTLY THE SAME in this sequel, almost 40 years after having made the first such movie, when the whole story was still original! This obviously shows the intent to address the second and third generation of kids, the children of those who saw the original. It adds absolutely nothing however in originality. 2. Casting: having said it's a rip-off, it doesn't stop there. Aged actors from the original movie (Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Best Friend Chewbacca) line up to remind us that this IS Star Wars. This time around however to appeal to the "elder" generation: those who were kids when they first watched SW and should now feel connected enough to keep bringing their kids to the remaining two episodes as well.. The younger actors (Finn, Rey, Kylo Ren) however are just a joke. While Finn is the funny guy who needs to appeal to insecurities in all of us and never takes off his surprised-look mask (despite chopping up half the galaxy while he's "doing the right thing"), Rey is the next-gen copy of Luke Skywalker, except it's the 21st-cent politically correct (female) version that speaks as if she just left drama class, but despite the haughtiness of noblesse, feels the need to stomp around like a fishwife. Unlike the ¬Ñold Luke", she is a modern control-freak, the emancipated girl-power type, sweat dripping in buckets by the effort of balancing femininity with the pseudo-liberal BS of "equality". Literally the actress is overwhelmed by her role and she simply overdoes it where most would have failed anyway, but better casting would still have saved some face. Third in row is the hysterical spoiled brat Kylo Ren, who sounds quite cool while still in his mask, if only he would not behave like a 5 year old who is easier manipulated than a puppy and looses the sinister image as soon as he takes off his mask and starts smashing furniture at the slightest setback. Reminds us of the same mistake made with using Hayden Christensen who played Anakin Skywalker turning from naive kid to hurt adolescent in Episode 3. Shouldn't that have been a sign for J.J.Abrams not to make the same mistake of taking away coolness from a Jedi?.. Breaking kitchenware will hardly appeal to any 21st century kid when the prime-evil character needs a touch of coolness. I don't even go into detailing the new "wise" CGI character of the 21st century politically-correct (female) version of Yoda, a passing whim with not a fraction of Yoda's charisma, despite being 1000 years of age. Oh, the glasses..yeah, I guess that makes her wise. Just shows how poor of a job the director did, if a character needs glasses to gain some respect from the viewer. Maybe a tattoo like "I'm the smartest chick around the block" would have been even more obvious J.J., on her forehead! To sum up the cast(rat)ing change: while almost 40 years ago we had a kid with hidden talents and a strong sister who finally melted by the charms of a bounty hunter, with the most bad-ass black-masked Evil of all times, J.J.Abrams now gave us panicky Finn, angry Rey and hysterical K-ren.. Just shows you Hollywood does not want role-models kids could look up to but gives them excuses for being like a wet rag. 3. Dialogues and character development: repetitive, simplistic jokes that were trendy when they first appeared by Spielberg in the eighties in the Indiana Jones franchise. Are they still cool 30 years later?.. If J.J. Abrams partners with Spielberg in the future, I would understand his urge to comply with the Master of Hollywood's flat directing style at the cost of authenticity, but for everyone else it's time travel backwards and not in a nostalgic sense. The movie and the reviews show that it pays off to totally remake a movie with no originality, poor acting, not even using minor storyline techniques to show anything new, brainwashing the audience to even reviewing it positively and not even to be punished for it. It's cheap, it's a disgraceful abuse of an original idea and all the energy put into the original movie and makes me wonder why this should be allowed in the first place. At any case, it robs a whole generation that grew up with Star Wars from its past, to replace it with a cheap remake.Star Wars, Episode VII: A New Reboot Watching this movie is like having the pathways in your brain responsible for the feeling of deja vu malfunction and get stuck on replay. For 138 minutes. ***Spoilers*** "The Force Awakens" is basically "A New Hope" in a peculiar alternate universe. In this strange new realm, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia have both been reincarnated as the same character: Rey. Rey is the highlight of the movie, not really for her story or Ridley's acting performance, but because of her Luke-like earnestness and Ridley's good looks. Han Solo has been reincarnated as Finn. But instead of being a hotshot pilot and pirate, he is now a goofy janitor, runaway stormtrooper, and blundering coward. Sheesh, makes you wonder what Harrison Ford did to make JJ Abrams get back at him in such an underhanded and passive aggressive way.... Obi-Wan has come back as an elderly version of Han Solo. "Who's more foolish now, eh? The fool, or the one who follows the fool".... Or the one who becomes the fool? Tee hee! Abrams, whatever problem you have with Harrison Ford, you should settle it like normal people. Face-to-face. Off-screen. Darth Vader has been reincarnated as the character of Severus Snape. Which is a bit odd, even for this alternate version reality. Eh, if JK Rowling's okay with it, I guess we should be, too. Palpatine is Snoke. Yoda appears as a yellow Pokemon alien. There are no new planets. Tatooine, Yavin 4, and Hoth are all featured in this movie, but with different names, of course. As is the case for the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance, and the Empire. Even the Death Star plans have made a comeback -- as coordinates for Luke's location. (Elderly, second-Yoda Luke, not Rey). In a SW first, there is no eye candy for the ladies in this movie. Okay, so the red-haired reincarnation of Moff Jerjerrod, but he's barely seen, and maybe Poe Dameron (new Wedge Antilles) who's also barely there. Rey unfortunately never wears any beautifully outlandish SW costumes, which is another SW first for a female lead. Sorry, girls. Needless to say, I won't be paying to watch the next chapter in SW, "The Reboot Strikes Back," though I have to admit I'm a bit curious who and what General Rieekan, Lando Calrissian, the AT-AT walkers, and the space slug will reincarnate as.I'm so disappointed I still can't believe it. How is it possible to turn something special, into something awful in just two hours. The whole Sci-Fi community waited such a long time for the SW - Saga to carriing on. And then came this. One of the most ...... up movies I ever had to watch in my entire life. J.J. Abrams is one the most uncreative, non visionairy falsifier in the film industry. Every movie directed by him, has a enormous touch of a cheap TV-series. So does "HIS" Star Wars Movie. I say his movie because, this is not a movie made for the millions of fans all over the world, who looked forward for a new breath taking adventure. Specially for those who already read Timothy Zahn's Star Wars books, this movie is just unbearable. No it is only made to satify his own, way to big ego. He already ruined the Star Trek Saga by turning it in to a stupid crash-boom-bang movie, taking place in a parallel universe. And now he destroyed Star Wars. I just hope, that the upcoming movies will be produced under the advice of George Lucas. That would be really nice, because it hurts to read all those reviewes from angry and disappointed fans. Ant it hurts much more to be one those.JJ Abrams ruined Star Wars and possibly the future of the franchise I would like to start this review but saying that I have seen all the movies and have read almost every expanded universe book that has been written, something that I highly doubt J.J. Abrams has done. There weren't many things done right with this movie except that the graphics looked good and there was not an annoying Jar Jar Binks-like character. The major issues that I see are: 1) The movie is essentially a remake of the original Star Wars. The new rebellion (aka the Resistance). A new empire (aka the First Order). A new Luke Skywalker (aka Rey). New Death Star (aka much bigger death star). I don't even know if they can come back from this... 2) The expanded universe books are so good and they decided to completely trash everything that has been written about Star Wars and start over. I think this is a big mistake. 3) The casting seemed motivated from a diversity/politically correct perspective. I am all for diversity, but they went way overboard. 4) The strong female main character, Rey, is from a backwater planet with virtually nothing positive to say about it. However, she is stronger, faster, and smarter than everyone around her including Han Solo and the trained warrior, Finn (more comments about him below). She knows how to fix and fly a starship. She can use a light saber and beat a trained dark-side force user in one-on-one combat. This trained force user is incredibly powerful as shown by his ability to stop a blaster bolt in mid-fire, something that would be incredibly difficult for only but the strongest force users. Also, she showed Han Solo how to fix his ship that he has been using for 50 years. 5) Finn is a storm trooper, taken from his parents at birth and trained as a fighter and warrior. Yet, he acts scared throughout the movie. He doesn't know how to fight, fly a ship, or anything else a trained warrior should be able to do. Instead, Rey, who grew up on a backwater planet is the fighter and not afraid of anything. Rey, who was never trained to do anything really except survive on a backwater desert planet. I am extremely disappointed and cannot imagine that George Lucas approved of this. I have lost a LOT of respect for J. J. Abrams and think that he might have irretrievably ruined the story line.Sponging on market profits since the last Star wars movie Repeat same story line from previous episodes that consisting of the following a twin was born (a boy and a girl),  there are two bad guys who are Sith Lords the bad guys are building an artificial planet that is also a very powerful weapon the good guys will fight the bad guys with a few planes and is good enough to finish off the artificial planet. It is always that Sith Lords work in pairs, and refused to learn the lesson that two will always lose out to all the Jedis. And the Sith Lords always like to build an artificial planet, despite learning that the idea will never match a few good planes bombing its energy core. This really came at an expense on the quality of work and story of Disney.Complete and Utter Insult to the Star Wars Universe Really enjoyed Marvel's Star Wars.

J.J has directed a fun, action filled Star Wars film that feels like the original trilogy, but also feels very new, Ridley and Boyega lead the acting pack in the film and in turn give us some great performances and new characters to love in the franchise. Ford and Issac also deliver great performances, and Driver feels very whiny, but he does great with what he's given. The beginning and the middle are great, but the third act is very repetitive of A New Hope, but that said Lucas loves rhyming in the SW universe, it's like a poem, so I don't mind it that much because there is plenty of new stuff to detract from that. All in all TFA is a solid Star Wars film there rejouvenated the franchise and shows us that Disney can take care of our beloved universe.What the franchise needed After the painful prequel trilogy filled with bad dialogue, bad acting, bad directing and a confused narrative we get this modern day classic that will inspire a new generation of kids. It's a great movie for huge Star Wars fans like myself without being to heavy handed with the refrences. They introduce the new characters and develop them and let the old which we already know and love take a back seat. Don't listen to the negative reviews it's a great movie and lots of work was put into it and they really care about the film. It feels genuine unlike the prequels which feel artificial and the director just sat in a chair watching a screen and didn't work with the actors. If you haven't already seen it for some reason watch it!Too Nostalgic, but Still Good With a series as beloved as Star Wars, anything is possible. The Force Awakens, the beginning of the sequel trilogy, is quite possibly the most anticipated movie of all time. The fact that it reeled in a record breaking $250,000,000 opening weekend in the U.S. alone is a testament to the popularity of this franchise. So, was it worth the wait? That's an interesting question. For many people, myself included, the nostalgia blinders came with the movie. The anticipation before the opening crawl and the euphoria that that classic opening note brought was an unforgettable experience. This movie brought out happy memories of watching the Original Trilogy for the first time, and the wonder and mystery that the galaxy of Star Wars brought us. However, the movie relies way too much on the nostalgia factor. The best and most memorable things about this movie (aside from that scene, of course) were the opening crawl, the appearance of the Millennium Falcon, the first appearances of the original characters (especially Han and Chewie), and the scene with Darth Vader's helmet. Aside from those things, it's a carbonite copy of the original 1977 movie, with the exact same story arc. There's very little originality, which is a massive detractor. Even the ships and vehicles are exactly the same, with a few exceptions. Of course, Starkiller Base is just another Death Star, even if the way it works is awesome. Even the character's roles feel recycled from the Original Trilogy. Rey is Luke (the desert dwelling, force sensitive protagonist), Finn is Han (The guy who tries to stay out of it but ends up coming back in), Poe is Leia (The one with the droid with the important message), BB-8 is R2-D2 (said droid), Han is Obi-Wan (The mentor who fought in the previous war), and Luke is Yoda (The Jedi who is now a recluse). While this is bad, it doesn't mean the characters are bad. They're not entirely recycled, but the roles they play certainly are. This isn't a bad movie, though. There really is a lot to like. The new characters were pretty good. With Rey, they set her up as a very mysterious figure, one you wonder about regarding who she is and where she's going. While Force Awakens doesn't reveal any of that, it sets it up for later installments. (By the way, this review is judging TFA independently from Last Jedi). Finn goes from being a cowardly deserter to someone who stands up and fights for his cause. Poe's nothing to write home about. Kylo Ren is simultaneously the best character in this movie and the worst. He's the best at the beginning, when you first see him in the black armor with the hood up. He looks awesome. Without the helmet, he's not so great. BB-8 is just about the cutest droid/robot ever. Also extremely marketable. Snoke was great. Han and Chewie really stole the show, mostly because of how long its been since they had screen time together. And also, unlike with the Prequels, when you know what's going to happen, as you've probably seen the Originals, there's a feeling of suspense where you know the characters you've grown to love are in danger, and you desperately want to see them come out OK. Oh, and, you know that feeling when you really want to talk about a movie spoiler but you can't because not everyone saw it as early as you? Yeah. This really went into effect here. Upon the first viewing of this movie, the nostalgia factor made it appear much better than it actually is. I thought this movie was a solid 9/10 after seeing it for the first time. It really isn't. It's still a good movie, though. Most of the callbacks to the original trilogy were welcome, the visuals are spectacular, John Williams continues his perfect track record, and most importantly, it got us interested in where they would take the series with the next installment.Superb Thankfully, the Star Wars franchise can get back to fun, and character, and unpredictability. After the durge created by the flaccid prequel trilogy, where there was no emotion, nor effort to wield a lightsaber, and no need to develop personality, it's great to see an unhinged evil character, an uncertain female protagonist, and an awesome droid!  Fanboys will obviously lament not having back stories and canon adherence to "the force", or that stuffy old men aren't as prolific in this new version, but this is the way forward, not dwelling in the past.  Lucas proved he was no director with EPS 1-3, so it is great to have the mantle handed over to film makers.Few risks, fan service and opening some questions My title sums up this movie. You want to see the Falcon? A cool red light-saber? Han and Chewie? And see a bunch of X-wings destroy the Deat... I mean Starkiller base? Well, you'll get it. Casting is pretty decent, Poe, Finny and even BB8 are kinda okay. Rey, I still don't know what to think of her. A bit too na√Øve and innocent in my opinion but she's not annoying at least. And Kylo... Kylo is pretty much the risk this movie has taken, by making him look really awesome with his outfit, saber and mask aaaaand surprising you when you see his face. I think it was a good choice in the end. It's a solid and simple star wars movie. A bit of plot and "star wars science" holes, like how in such a huge galaxy can they see the shot of starkiller and the explosion of the planets? Unless they're in the same system, not possible. During the fight after Maz Cantina gets blown up... where did everyone go? The cantina was full. Somehow only Han and friends get out of the debris. Rey's awakening is a bit weird but why not. Personally I would have made her force sensitive when she's running after Finn who's going to get eaten by the weird worm creatures on Han's ship. Not even going to ask why did those creatures insta kill all the bad guys but they capture Finn... with all those tentacles, don't ask. Anyways, a good and entertaining star wars movie. Good action, decent actors, good CGI. Just a bit too predictable.7 but still my least favorite I have to be honest with myself. For some reason when I watched this movie it felt like there was something missing. The prequels to the original get so much constant hate and criticism and no one points out the positive things about those movies.. .. I actually enjoyed watching those movies more than this one despite some cheesy lines, over use of CGI and annoying characters like JaJa..  I feel this way because episodes 1-3 still had that magic touch.. I don't know what it is but it still maintained a certain type of feel and flow of the original movies. It had things about those movies that were very memorable, original, yet still felt familiar.. That is what I feel was lacking in this one. There was nothing about it that really stood out.. It tried to be Star Wars so hard, but it failed. It just felt like "someone else" was trying to copy and remake the Star Wars theme.. None of the characters were memorable.. None of the fight scenes were really memorable.. Each one of the Star Wars movies before it had something that really stood out . I could watch all six of the Star Wars movies over again .... But this one I feel like after watching it once.. I don't really care if I see it again. Even Harrison Ford didn't look into it. It was like someone dragged him out of bed and forced him to do this movie.. His acting was very lack luster.  There was no imagination in this movie but simply a rehash without the same flow and rhythm of the other six.. Here's what stands out for me. . Ep 1 - Darth maul.. 10x better of a character.. the one in force awakens felt more like watching a space balls villain .... Pod racing.. That really stood out.. The music and fight scenes with darth maul... Awesome acting by liam Neeson and McGreggor..  Ep2- The clone wars battle scene was a pretty epic battle and very memorable. Seeing yoda younger and actually fighting was memorable even if it was funny to watch. A lot of memorable acting and synergy between Anakin and Obi Wan..  Ep3- was dark, told the story that lead up to the originals... The final battle was very memorable.. the ending stood in my mind for awhile... The Emperors acting was on point..  Force awakens- The best thing i liked about it really was the new droid.. Oh and if you want to count a progressive approach having a woman and black guy be the main characters.. but I don't really care about any of that.  My score... originals were my favorite. followed by rogue one and the prequels.. Force Awakens was the least enjoyable to watch for me.What happened to Star Wars? This movie was okay, but not even close to as good as the original trilogy.The Force(d) Awakens J.J. Abrams reignites and revitalizes a galaxy far, far away with raw, practical wonder like never before, with a story that feels like more of an unfulfilling reunion show, but an exhilarating reunion nonetheless. Ever since the prequels, in fact ever since the originals, we (Star Wars enthusiasts) have been anxiously anticipating a return to the Star Wars universe, and ever since it was announced back in 2013, it rose the potential for a brand new trilogy, hopefully out-grown and learned from the prequels, and true to the originals, to create something truly new and extraordinary. With a whole new set of characters, in a whole new set of stories, extraordinary, it is not. I don't want to bum out the incredibly protective fanbase, but if you're hoping for new planets, a different kind of Star Wars story we'd never seen before, or even an exploration of things you'd only dream of, dream again because Force Awakens takes such a safe route that it almost replicates, frame-by-frame, arch-by-arch "A New Hope" in a very respectable, but unnecessary way. First and foremost, the problem I have with "safe movies," is there's nothing to hate because no risks were taken. Example given// The Force Awakens. Now, that's not to say I didn't enjoy the movie by any stretch of the imagination because there's so much to love here. There's a certain mold that defines Star Wars and J.J. understands that beautifully. What I mean is the franchise's so-called style sort of rides this fine line of being overly-cheesy and overly-romantic in its cinematic experience. And its a style that really only works with Star Wars, but it's also a style that has become beloved and cherished by millions of people on the planet. And that said, "The Force Awakens" fully embraces this style and projects it on a stage of film-making, entertainment and execution that is at an incredibly high-level of craft, higher than almost any previous installment. It's all there. The performances are sensational, and are even better than expected. The returnees such as Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill are all terrific. But it's the new cast that's significant in this one, and do they ever steal the show. Daisy Ridley plays a wondrous scavenger in Rey, who really is the heart and hope of The Force Awakens, giving us a true female hero for this generation. John Boyega plays a runaway stormtrooper named FN217, or aka Finn, and comes across annoying at times, but plays it in a real "Star Warsy" way that's effective. But the one to talk about is Adam Driver who plays the emotionally corrupt villain Kylo Ren, who comes across so stellar that in his character's desires to become the next Darth Vader, you actually wish he was as he nails the Star Wars villain with humor and class as good as any before him. So in terms of craft and breaking down the filmmaking elements of "The Force Awakens," this movie has it all. But if those elements are in just a simple, safe story that you wish would go to the next level, then it's just promise. But you put those elements in a daring story, it's extraordinary. Unfortunately, it strays in the prior and stays safe. Without judging the performances, the new characters of Rey, Kylo and Finn are intriguing, but are nothing new. Furthermore where they take these characters, which could've been interesting to any inventive writer, they instead put in them in the default Star Wars character setting in the same-old story-verse we've seen and heard many times before. Now, the default setting isn't a bad thing, it's just that's what's keeping Episode 7 from being extraordinary. Now about the title. This installment delves into a concept that is referred to in the title as "The Force Awakens." Intriguing and relevant to the new trilogy. But as much as it is true in some ways, it isn't as relevant as it needs to be. In fact, to think about it, when was the Force ever Awakening, and when you really think about, there are only really 1 or 2 moments in the grand scale of the journey that makes this relevant in any way. The story actually focuses more on the search for Luke Skywalker, which in retrospect gives more sense to Episode 7 being titled "The Last Jedi," or even "Search for the Last Jedi." But, shouldn't it be exploring its own new fresh awakening, which is why its called Force Awakens in the first place? Yes, and that is where this movie is flawed. Not saying this movie doesn't go anywhere, it certainly does especially in the last act of the film. Its just for a good portion of this episode, we're left waiting in anxiety and we start to force our own awakening and wonder upon this movie in hopes it'll create some of it's own. It eventually does, but the line from the Yoda-like character referred to as Maz says, "a different question for a different time," completely defines this movie. Then until its final breathes, do we realize this may just be where the story really gets going. But it ends right there. Sure, it was a fun ride, but there were so much unfulfilled desires and hopes in the story and characters, other than the craftsmanship, there's really no reason to revisit Force Awakens other than getting giddy about a few promises that are soon to come, in sequels ahead. Yes, I am going overboard with the criticism here. But there was potential to take this installment in a direction that could've been extraordinary and new. The filmmaking was there, the performances were all there, but I feel as though the production was too in awe that they were making a Star Wars movie, and gave us something fun that pays too much omage. But that doesn't mean it isn't an exhilarating voyage into a galaxy far, far away. Its exuberant, fresh and has moments with awe that slice you right through the heart. Yes, it has its flaws, but every Star Wars movie does In the end of the day, this is a fine addition to an already celebrated and unprecedented saga that only brushes the surface, but brushes it in the most exciting way imaginable and leaves us a lot to look forward to. May the Force Be With You!An average Star Wars movie While doing her routine search for items which will bring her daily dose of food, Rey saves a tiny droid which is in need of even more help. Carrying an important piece of information, it must be taken urgently to the rebels. Together with a new friend, she'll have to face many adventures until the BB-8 completes its quest before the First Order gets its hands on him. This instalment of the Star Wars franchise has its story set in a time where The First Order has only the last hiding forces of the rebels to defeat before taking complete control. Young Rey is introduced into the story, along with her special abilities, who will prove to be a key factor in what is to come. We follow her, throughout many perils, full of captivating CGI and action sequences, typical to the series. Unfortunately, these are the main pluses of the movie, and not the same can be said about the story and the characters. Many are annoying or simply stupid, without a clear idea of their role, contributing one way or another to a story which simply doesn't provide something truly great. It is just OK, not very predictable but also not very complex, doing its job but nothing more.  I found it to be quite an average film, with only a couple of characters which are pleasant and dignified to be watched, bringing some substance to an average story which also contains characters which simply shouldn't exist, which have a tendency of getting on your nerves more than being useful. Besides this problems, if you look closer, you can still find some good aspects which ultimately transform this movie into a rather good watch. It still looks great, has plenty of action, and at least two or three good characters which somehow make up to the other disappointments. Overall, I found an average movie, which definitely could have been a lot better, but it simply fell into mediocrity due to a lack of story complexity and character development. I'm pretty sure that the series' fans will be disappointed with it, but for me it was somewhat OK.Recycled, nostalgic, and practically perfect JJ Abrams is really good at this: recycle the plot, reconfigure the characters and let the action take center stage. It is a simple formula. And it makes this movie cook with gas. Despite basically being a remake of the first Star Wars - from the plot to the characters - this story feels fresh and fun. Part of that's performances, but most of it is Abrams' sense of pace: more action, less trade policy. The flaws from the original trilogy are all here, especially the plot holes. But it is hard to notice them when you are having this much fun. Well worth the wait. (Let's pretend those prequels never happened.)Bringing back Star Wars !!! There is a moment towards the middle of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' when Han Solo says the following to Rey and Finn - "It's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true." - that particular line of dialogue to me completely and very clearly established and underlines the motive and the intent of JJ Abrams and Disney as a whole behind their collective approach in restarting the Star Wars Saga. Since the souring of the mood and the spirits of the diehard Star Wars fans triggered by the prequels, there had been a prolonged gap. The basic idea of 'The Force Awakens' is to end that gap by reaffirming the myths, the legends and the magic of Star Wars and reassure the fanbase with a film that symbolises the phrase - 'Star Wars(in its original form) is back !!!'  To me this idea of reaffirming the legend of 'Star Wars' has two repercussions which are very noticeable in the film. On one hand, certain elements that make the original trilogy wondrous like the joy and innocence of fantasies and adventures, Han Solo's charisma, etc. On the other hand, it also brings along with it the elements that have always prevented me from fully embracing Star Wars which are surface level storytelling, hokey and over-expressive dialogue,etc. Another problem with the film is that in trying to deliver on 'fan service', the film doubles down and flirts with the prospect of being a little over-abundant on references and moments that pay explicit homage to the original trilogy as well as overall narrative throughlines that again blatantly mirror a number of the occurrences in previous films in the series.  However what prevents the film from becoming an excuse in nostalgia porn is the characters. The new characters especially Rey and Finn were very likeable and they seem like individuals that I as a viewer would like to accompany in future adventures and spend time with. I mentioned earlier how 'Force Awakens' reaffirms the myths of Star Wars. Through Daisy Ridley's 'Rey', the film goes one step forward by hinting at powers and abilities which are unprecedented and almost incomprehensible(to Rey herself), the sources of which will probably be elaborated upon in the sequels. Harrison Ford manages to embody the swashbuckling Han Solo once again after all these years and it feels like older version of the exact same character from the original trilogy with the same charisma and sarcasm. Kylo Ren seemed interesting enough.  In an nutshell the film embodies certain elements that I have never completely been in tune with which are inherent to the concept of Star Wars itself. But having said that, with the basic energy and the exciting new characters, JJ Abrams managed to make me not only care about about this film, but also curious about what's to come next.A remake This film was visually stunning. However I feel it was simply a remake of episode IV: A New Hope with a subplot attached. I was and still am disappointed with the way this movie turnedBetter than I remember The first time I watched this I thought it was the worst in the saga but now on rewatch I find it the best after the original trilogy. This is the only Star Wars film until that point, including the original trilogy, in which I didn't cringe at a dialogue or acting at some point of the film. The set up of all the new characters and the world is so perfect while giving enough importance to the old characters just enough.Faithful to original films whilst bringing something new. Abrams' achievement in rebooting SW with such faithfulness to the original trilogy will guarantee his place in the history books as perhaps the greatest movie director.I'd give this a 10 if it weren't for "A New Hope" I'd have to admit, if this were a standalone film it would be fantastic, because JJ Abrams and his new crew of Star Wars makers did a really good job. However, I have no idea why, but for some reason he and Lawrence Kasdan decided to steal most if not all the aspects of "A New Hope" into this new storyline that would either make or break Disney's reputation for how well they can handle Star Wars. So here's my basic analysis of this movie compared to Episode IV (minor spoilers, if you don't want to read ahead). How the plot lines up with Episode IV  Stormtroopers, plus a Sith Lord who wears a mask that digitizes his voice, attack the good guys because they have valuable information, and one of the good guys sends off a droid with that information before getting captured. That droid with the valuable information comes across the lead protagonist, on a sandy planet, who later discovers Jedi powers. The stormtroopers find the droid with its Jedi partner, but then they escape in the Millennium Falcon (which the Jedi character regards as trashy). The bad guys have their headquarters on a gigantic fortress that has a cannon that can destroy entire planets. The new Jedi character comes across Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber. The new Jedi and friends come across the team of good guys and go to their planet that is moderately forest but somewhat swampy (I'm almost starting to wonder if it's the same planet in both movies), and discuss how to defeat the bad guys' planet-destroying headquarters. The good guys, with their X-Wings and Y-Wings, attack the enemy headquarters as it's preparing to destroy the good guys' headquarters. The Sith Lord manages to escape alive, along with various other members of his team, for the sake of setting up a sequel.  Here's other features of Episode IV that were placed in out of order  A stormtrooper rescues one of the bad guys' prisoners (the same prisoner who sent off the droid with the valuable information). The Millennium Falcon gets captured by tractor-beam. Han Solo has an unsettled debt with criminals. The main characters enter a cantina, where the gad buys have a spy who notices the droid with the valuable information (which later leads to a battle) , and one of the main characters pays someone for transportation. The main characters manually go in to disable the bad guys' fortress' shield. A old, mentor character is killed by the Sith Lord.  Now on the positive side, let me mention some original material (or at the very least, material that makes this plot unique) that this movie had.  The new Sith's lightsaber - it not only has the laser hilts, but the saber itself seems to have a different texture to it than most lightsabers. For some reason, none of the Sith are called "Darth". New force powers were introduced (such as force freeze and force faint), however I'm not too sure whether that's a plus for this movie. The leading character is female (all the previous Star Wars movies have had male characters), and she lives as a scavenger. A stormtrooper, out of his own conscience, chooses to betray the bad guys; this clearly shows actual personality to them as opposed to the previous Star Wars films, which depicts them as merely expendable objects. The new Jedi is able to discover that she is a Jedi all on her own; in Luke's and Anakin's cases, they needed another Jedi master to tell them that they were Jedi. The second-to-last fight scene is perhaps the most original Star Wars battle to date (the one on the green planet where that cantina is). A non-Jedi wields a lightsaber to fight the bad guys (Han Solo in E. V never fought stormtroopers with Luke's lightsaber, and General Grievous in E. III was already a bad guy). A stormtrooper wields a melee weapon, though this does somewhat compare to the Magnaguards in E. III. The Sith takes off his mask to show how ordinary he is (however, people initially laughed at his non-masked appearance). The Jedi=Sith battle at the end showed that neither side had too much experience with lightsabers. The valuable information contained by the droid isn't about defeating the bad guys, but it sets up the sequel.  The only reason why everyone has been rating this film 1-5 is because of how much of a remake of E. IV this is. I can totally understand their disappointment, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the movie itself was bad. I do agree that I was a little dumbfounded to see that this movie was too exact to E. IV, but I do still think that this movie was good enough to set a good reputation for Disney occupying Star Wars (you can at least admit that this movie was better than the prequels, right?). Like I said before, this is the only reason why I am rating this a 7; otherwise, I would have rated it a 10.Good old Star Wars action but d√©j√† vu First of all, as a huge Star Wars fan, I find that seeing a Star Wars movie on IMAX 3D with the latest CGI technology was astonishing. That movie was very beautiful. It successfully captured the essence of a Star Wars movie and I am not just talking about space and Jedi battles. I am talking about the mythical aspect of it like the good versus evil, light and dark, hope and despair contradictions. I am also talking about the constant change between order and stability for chaos and destruction. The story was dramatic and interesting but nothing we haven't already seen. This movie has so many similarities with A New Hope that it can be seen has an attempt to make easy money with the less effort possible. Seriously, the "Empire" has a huge super weapon and the "Rebels" need to stop it before it blows up planets. A mentor dies to help the greater cause. The apprentice uses her new found power to fight off the dark side. There wasn't much originality in the story but it the movie was still successful at capturing the essence of Star Wars. I really liked the new actors that they chose for this film. Especially John Boyega as Finn. That guy with BB8 were they comic duo of the movie. I really enjoyed watching them. Lupita Nyong'o is such a good actress. The way she acted, we were able to truly feel that Maz Kanata was very ancient and mystical. As for Rey, I wouldn't say that she was the best of the group but she played her role just fine. The only actor that I didn't feel that was fitting was Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. It's like Anakin Skywalker all over again but worst. I can understand that the Director wanted us to see that Kylo Ren is very conflicted between good and evil because of his ties to his family. That he was not a slave like Anakin and that he had everything before going to the dark side which make him looks like nothing is enough. The character really looked more immature than he should be. Even though he was a grown man, to me, he looked like a winy teenager. Finally, I could have been harder on the movie and give it less than a 7 but even though the story was not original, the actors and the universe gave this movie enough appeal so that I can recommend it.Everything old is new again I just came from seeing STAR WARS VII! Before I get started, I'd just like to point out that I have never seen a movie with as much hype behind it in my life! Disney has really pulled out all the stops and spared no expense in stoking the flames of this release. With all the merchandising and third party tie in's from makeup to jewelry to breakfast cereal to (no lie) oranges, this movie is set up to possibly be the biggest movie of all time! As a matter of fact, it's so set itself up that if it's anything less than that some will look at it as a failure. Directed by Hollywood powerhouse J.J. Abrams, the director of the Star Trek reboot, this new Star Wars movie seeks to blow more wind into the sails of the biggest film franchise of all time and wash the taste of the ill fated prequels from the mouths of Star Wars fans everywhere. So what does that mean for you, John and Jane Q. Movie-goer? Well, it typically means one of two things, either it is in fact the greatest movie ever made or it's a rotten piece of garbage that the studio is hoping for big numbers for in the first few weeks before people realize that it stinks on ice. Well folks, I've just come from the theater and I have to say that without a doubt, Star Wars delivers! Just to give you a bit of a background, the last time we we heard about the saga going on in a galaxy far, far away, Luke Skywalker and the Rebel Alliance had just defeated Darth Vader the evil Emperor Palpatine. The story in Star Wars VII takes place some 25 years after the defeat of the Galactic Empire where out of the ashes of the now defunct empire a new evil has emerged in the form of The First Order, an oppressive force bent on destroying Luke Skywalker and his group of Jedi Knights who have since gone into hiding. At the same time a faction of the Rebel Alliance known as The Resistance seeks to find Luke and fight The First Order. This story is centered around The characters Rey and Finn, two misfits, played by relative Hollywood newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega and their journey to help The Resistance find Luke Skywalker at any cost. I'd love to tell more, but given the nature of this film, it's best to leave the details of the plot alone. Let's just say that they, along with Oscar Issac, who plays the hot shot X-Wing pilot Poe, do a great job of breathing some much needed new life into this franchise. At the same time, Domhnall Gleeson, Adam Driver and Andy Circus are famously evil as the quasi-Nazi First Order. This movie is not all new blood however, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and all your favorite Star Wars heroes like Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 make appearances here and they work well to provide balance between the old and the new in the film. The special effects are fantastic, the action scenes are crisp and well choreographed and the story is thrilling, fast paced and immersive, with equal parts old and new Star Wars, bringing in new characters and new stories while at the same time taking quite a few cues from the original Star Wars which for me ended up being both heart warming and a little disappointing seeing as the familiar parts begin to give the movie a bit of the Ghostbusters 2 syndrome in that a few too many of the same notes from the old series are hit. All in all, I really really liked this movie and it's faults are all but crushed by it's hundreds of positives from funny script writing to thrilling visuals to the pure rush I got from seeing some of the old characters back together. I am definitely looking forward to seeing this movie at least another 2 times in the theater. Star Wars: The Force Awakens get a 4.5... out of 5.The Good, The Bad, &amp; The Ugly NOTE: I watched this film with an abject disdain. As a result I wasn't nearly as bitter by the time the film concluded. I've since rewatched it twice to get a better handle on how to rate it. I was born in the Time Gap between the Trilogy and the Prequels so I was very hyper-analytical when I watched this because I felt (And still feel) that the Prequels were an abomination where George Lucas attempted to cash in on the Trilogies iconic status. This is as unbiased a review as I can possibly produce. Here's the breakdown. Visuals: 8.1 (It was fine. It was space &amp; planets that looked like space &amp; planets)  Effects: 7.4 (Some of the CGI was still a little too out-of-place, but not awful)  Script &amp; Writing: 7.2 (It was better than the Lucas Prequels, so...yeah)  Sound &amp; Music: 8.1 (It's Star Wars. Give John Williams a baton or emulate him in every conceivable fashion &amp; you win)  Acting: 7.3 (It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but could have been better)  Directing: 7.6 (It was a fair approach that tried to honor the Trilogy)  Overall Rating: 7.6 (Fair to Decent) Whether you like this movie or do not will be entirely subjective to what you'd expect and hope it to be. I honestly cannot tell you whether or not you'll love it or hate it. I think how you approach it may ease the transition into it. As far as anyone's statements about PC-Star Wars or what not, I do disagree with that. I think the new actors did alright. They had an admittedly difficult set of shoes to fill. I'm obliged to maintain a spoiler free atmosphere with my reviews so I won't get into anything deeper than that. The returning cast did their jobs. The problem to me isn't that this movie was good or bad or ugly, the problem is the Ghostbusters-factor. After a certain amount of time has passed it gradually becomes impossible to produce a film, series, or variation of such based on an original film, series, or variation that will hold up to the standards of the fanbase. Is this film for kids? Probably not toddlers but yeah I'd say while some of the scenes have more aggressive tones older kids and younger teens could probably handle it fine. It depends on your child really. Will fans of the Trilogy like it? Depends on the fan and how they approach, along with their expectations upon entering. I didn't hate it. I didn't love it. It was fair to decent, parts were good, parts were meh, and parts were bad. Eye of the Beholder film for sure.It's Star Wars for new generation. That's what I told the guy sitting next to me in the theatre in South San Francisco off of 280 when he and I exchanged some thoughts on the then new Star Wars film. It was fun to see, but Disney's film is handicapped by the following; this film didn't come on the heels of 30+ years of ultra- serious dramas or very corny musicals, where sci-fi was a thing given to kiddies or the "brainiacs" or "nerds" who liked to engage in technical and scientific things, but who didn't date much (note the sexual undercurrent in a lot of sci-fi from the 50s and 60s). Star Wars, the original 1977 feature film, had that benefit. There was 2001 Space Odyssey, Logan's Run the year before with its awful miniatures, and the Star Trek TV series that had been canceled a few years before, but effects technology at the time was more miss than hit, and the genre itself, other than classic Star Trek, really wasn't taken all that seriously. So when Star Wars hit the screen people were blown away by it. The Force Awakens, or more specifically the people who made it, know they can't repeat those conditions that gave the 1977 film that "wow effect", so it steers more towards a graphic-novel like presentation, complete with emotional intrigue among the characters to try and compliment that large SFX wizardry that's presented on screen. But that's kind of the draw back to The Force Awakens. It's a victim of its own circumstances where we have lots of effects heavy films in the Superhero genre and other tangential scifi sub-genres already tumbling out of Hollwood studios, one after the other. Therefore any visual bedazzlement from The Force Awakens needs to be fairly spectacular to compete with and against the other films. Do we get that? In some respect. The effects are impressive, but the story elements they're meant to accentuate, at times, seem a bit odd. Storywise there's a real attempt to re-invent the basic story for the whole saga, taking some cues from graphic-novel story conventions. Which in turn gives the film a very 2000's kind of look and feel. The visual presentation and interweaving romantic- tension subplots is a very post 80's story telling style, of which I am not a fan. It is my opinion that the story is the story. A romance or sexual tension can be part of that story, but today is meant to run parallel to the main-story as a backdrop thread to appease those who have interests in such matters. The final summation implies that the romance is just as important as needing to defeat the bad guys or overcome the harrowing situation. And, to be brutally honest, both men and women know that that is not true in any situation where this is the setting. And ultimately this is why I liked the film as a Sunday afternoon kind of affair; couch, summer-Sunday, window open, maybe the fan running slightly in the background, maybe your dog sleeping next to you or in a cool spot of the house, and you have this thing on at a low volume as you lay back and watch it with nothing else to do. To me that's the kind of movie this is. It lacks grit, uses conventional modern Disney story telling styles to recirculate the death star plot from the 1977 feature film. And where 1977's film prepared my generation for social and personal challenges in a world that would increasingly rely on tech, this film posits more romantic and interpersonal preparation for a multi- ethnic world. To me that message is many days late and several dollars short. The exit of a major character, the under-exposition of classic characters, a reliance on a plot already used, doesn't really add up to neither an outstanding nor poor film experience, but one that just happens to be. It's almost like a social commentary on what already is, and a warning against the regurgitation of past ideologies.  My last observation is that this is aimed at the teen-aged children of the teenagers and pre-teens who saw the film way back in 1977. Which I think makes for an odd film making and directorial style, because we're not exposed to classic film making here, but someone's idea of what today's teens want to see. That includes that exit of a major character, which seemed hammy and nearly anti-climactic; i.e. no "disturbances in the force" was felt because of this. A dramatic moment that felt like a real over the top story point that had no emotional impact, as it should have.  I guess the best one could say is that if Disney had produced Star Wars, then this is the result we would get. I think that's the fairest statement anyone can make, and all that it implies. Watch at your risk, but maybe relax while doing so.Love Star Wars First of all, I love Star Wars series because it is not SF, but it describes the family relation and the problem of virtue and evil. The background is imaginary, but we have the same problem as its core theme. In Star Wars episode VII , many people discuss mainly "who is Ray? " And I think she describes the figure of every girls live this modern society. She is asked " Who are you?"by everyone, and also ask herself the same way. She cannot sure her identity, but she has strong mental power to live through life. This implies the way girls live their life . Moreover, Kylo Ren's inner weakness suggests human's weakness. His appearance seems to be very strong and evil, however, his true figure is very fragile. He cannot establish his existence and seems to have bemusement about which he belongs, "virtue or evil?". Such conflict often occurs when we live life. Anyway, I cannot wait the sequel.Okay Storyline... I think the main reason we all saw the movie was Luke Skywalker, who doesn't show up until the end of the movie...That was not the only thing, the story line to it was a little dull if you ask me. All in all the move was good. But with all that being said it was a pretty good movie with everything a movie needs. Twists in the plot such as Han Solo murdered by Kylo Ren (His Son) was a nice twist in the story, though me and my family are huge Han Solo fans it was a nice twist to the story I have to admit. If a little more effort was put into it I think it would've been a lot better. I would say I recommend this movie to people but it is out of theateres, so you should buy it on DVD if you have not seen it yet.Won This Guy Over So I'm not into big blockbuster movies normally. I prefer more cerebral, laboured, art-house indie films. I find the constant overwhelming spectacle of noise, explosions, and unrealistic worlds which derive from spinoffs of pre-existing lore, mythology, and legends exhausting and cardboard-thin. However with this iteration of Star Wars, and I don't know why the others, including the classics, never had that effect on me, it feels like there's an air of magic, and childhood wonder wrapped into it. Perhaps I'm wrong, but what I got a sense of is that every actor, creative, and person on set had a childhood reverence and excitement in them when it came to making this movie. And it doesn't matter that you will be staring at odd looking aliens, or seeing humans interact with machines in implausible ways, or that people's names, or that of planets, are sometimes outright ridiculous. It matters that, 3 minutes in, you just don't care, and end up watching the whole thing with a smile 3 miles wide. Awesome.Great for Star Wars fans.. "Meh" for film fans So what did I think of the next chapter in Star Wars? To be honest, yes, the Star Wars geek in me was yelling in excitement on the inside. I actually did tear up a little when the scrolling credits started up. So as a fan, I loved it. It has been far too long that I have been wanting to know the next story but lets be critical shall we? I was not blown away by this film as many fans (including myself) was expecting to be. I found the story a little predictable at times and clich√©. I found the comedy within the movie far too Disney-esque. Something I would expect and welcome in a Marvel movie because that is what I love coming out of my favorite super heroes mouth's but Star Wars? Not so much. Also, as a Star Wars fan I was upset with the lack of light saber action. On the other end though, I enjoyed the action sequences as a whole. From the ground combat to the dogfights in the sky; Star Wars delivered and it was quite epic. The returning faces were great to see as well in their respective scenes. So again, as a whole the film brought the pain and I enjoyed the majority of it. I have waited a long time for this as a fan and it fulfilled the void in my heart for a good Star Wars film. I hope for the next installment that there is much more force and light sabers. So here's to waiting a couple years for the next one to come.The $2 Billion Reboot Episode VII in the "Star Wars" saga serves to reunite some of our favorite characters (and actors) from the very first film of 1977. Harrison Ford is back as Han Solo, as is Carrie Fisher as the Princess Leia Organa. Mark Hamill has a cameo appearance as Luke Skywalker. There are also three great new characters joining the resistance movement against the formidable First Order. They include a dynamic performance by Daisy Rider as Rey, John Boyega as Finn, and Oscar Isaac as the pilot Poe Dameron. R2-D2, C-CPO, and Chewie Chewbaca are also back! The plot of "The Force Awakens" is a virtual cookie cutter from the original "Star Wars" film with the same stages of the hero's journey. More than any other character, the central hero is the character of Rey, as she discovers the force within her to the overcome adversity of The First Order. The most dramatic scene in the film is a tension-packed meeting of father and son when Han Solo confronts his son on a bridge. Adam Driver turns in a good performance as the son, Kylo Ren, who has gone over to the other side. The meeting of father and son has Oedipal connotations exactly like the relationship of Luke and Darth Vader. For 135 minutes, this "Star Wars" film has plenty of action and lively moments, the best of which involve the sly and sassy remarks of Han Solo. Not to be missed!Not Much New Here The story is a rehash of all the episodes that went before with some exception: the Bad Guys are now called The First Order led by the Supreme Leader Snoke played by Andy Serkis. The main premise centers on finding Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) so that he cannot lead a rebellion against the First Order. Luke had gone into seclusion. The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the CGI which is again spectacular. Nothing is really new except for the young scavenger girl Rey played by Daisy Ridley and she is pretty and a breath of fresh air in a series that truly needs it.  Of course, the First Order has a weapon that uses the power of the sun to destroy the Republic led by General/Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). The main fallacy here is that had the First Order used the weapon and destroyed the Republic and didn't concentrate on finding Luke, well, that would have been that and end of story. But they didn't and well, you know the good guys -- ( Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) -- will find a way to destroy the First Order. Hey, it's in the script. (You waited on that one, eh?) There are some almost good lines between Han Solo and Chewbacca and sometimes Rey. Han Solo does comment on Princess Leia's hair (he likes it this way) that was atrocious in previous Star Wars movies. We learn that the General under Supreme Leader Snoke is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who happens to be the son of Han Solo and Princess Leia. Who knew? (I believe you fell asleep in previous stories) Yes, that is true, the never ending battles and explosions all over the galaxy have that tendency to put me into la la land. This time the battles didn't last as long and that was a good thing. Something that was disappointing was the voice of General Kylo Ren. We expected it to be more along the lines of Darth Vader back in the day. But he sounded more like a Brooklynite who happened to be in charge of Storm Troopers in the First Order. (yes, we expected something more commanding along Darth Vader's voice especially with the Mask on.) One other thing that may or may not be true, but sometimes I had the feeling that some conversations were dubbed. Could have been just me, but¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö If one had never seen previous Star Wars movies this movie will be excellent and quite enjoyable, but for others we saw a rehash of previous versions, nothing really new and it's just the same with the good guys going after the bad guys that included spectacular CGI to include outstanding cinematography. (7/10) Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.JJ Did It! JJ Abrams nailed it. The movie had extremely high expectations. Considering the hype, I would say I was satisfied. The visuals were very well done and did not make your head spin (like most high speed CG movies today). Daisy and Boyega performed very well and I look forward to their performance in next installment of the franchise. But the best part to me was the background score. It really evoked the feeling of pure joy that the prequels could not. Watch the trailer again after seeing the film and you will be amazed at how cleverly they managed to keep the film under the wraps. Great end to a stellar year Hollywood. Good on you."Star Wars: The Force Awakens" is ultimately a collection of counterparts and equivalents. Thirty years after the defeat of Emperor Palpatine and the Galactic Empire, a new threat has arisen to once again bring terror and destruction to the galaxy. The self-proclaimed "First Order" military force, led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and the mysterious Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), strategically conspires to attack the Republic to regain their former glory. But when conflicted stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) disobeys his murderous orders to instead aid in the escape of Resistance fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), he sets in motion a cataclysmic battle between good and evil that will bring him face to face with a pretty scavenger (Daisy Ridley), a vicious Dark Jedi, and a legendary duo from the past. It's just not quite the same without the Twentieth Century Fox fanfare prior to the now unmistakable line, "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away¬Ö" Nevertheless, John Williams' thunderous theme music and the yellow scrolling text instantly put the viewer back into that nostalgic territory of what George Lucas started back in 1977. This new chapter is, in large part, an attempt to undo what Lucas then did to the franchise with his staggeringly mediocre prequel trilogy, which itself felt like an opportunistic endeavor rather than a passionate work of art. "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" is ultimately a collection of counterparts and equivalents. The more the filmmakers attempt to recreate the substance of the original three pictures, the more it negates its own reason for existence. To its credit, most of the imagery and sound effects and character designs do possess an aura of authenticity when compared directly to the former vision (almost as if this project commenced around 1986, keeping up with the three-year gaps). But in sticking to so many familiar elements, the project forgot to craft its own identity; it's unmistakably reminiscent of a remake. From the blaster fire, to the massive Star Destroyers crossing star-speckled skies, to the rubbery alien faces populating desert communities, to the black-cloaked villain stepping from his transport, to the droids rolling and chirping about, so much of this undertaking is recycled. Director J.J. Abrams would insist that all of the similarities are nods or homage, but by the time the heavily-secreted plot is revealed, it's entirely obvious that no new story is awaiting to unfold. Damsels in distress, familial betrayals, roguish pilots engaging in daredevil maneuvers, planet-destroying weapons, good versus evil, and vastly outnumbered rebels proposing speculative plans to blow things up, all return in spades, but without the inspiration needed to demonstrate something novel or impactful. However, a dash of blood here and there appears generally unconventional. "I've got a bad feeling about this." The dialogue also conforms to the mood and tone of the '77 classic, plucking snippets from the prior six episodes to such a great degree that it's possible the whole screenplay does not contain a single line of fresh material. And the storyline once again starts in the middle of a middle (not unlike "The Empire Strikes Back"), recognizing that, certainly not serving as a standalone entry, this enterprise will be best appreciated by longtime fans. It's also under the impression that audiences require constant action, as it creates a static level of nonstop tumult in which no single sequence has the chance to stand out. But in the end, though it may have lost a good portion of the magic, every so often, when an iconic component or character makes a grandiose appearance (and there are plenty of notable arrivals), it's difficult not to revel in the experience of witnessing a familiar cast wield the Force and do battle against the Dark Side - the right way and for the first time in over 30 years.  The Massie Twins A (near) perfect synthesis of old and new. This FEELS like Star Wars! This movie hits every conceivable emotion, but above all, it's fun. Nowadays, we have so much dark gritty stuff which is great and deep, but it gets tiring. And, things that try to be fun come off as overly silly and dumbed down. The Force Awakens does something not many films have done successfully in a while; combine the two seamlessly into one balanced package. The prequels tried to do this, and it blew up in Lucas' face. The reason it works in this movie is that all the humour and drama comes naturally from the characters. Yes, the plot and beats are VERY similar to A New Hope, but that was a great movie. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Besides, that's exactly what's been missing from movies lately. So don't listen to all these negative reviewers saying "it's a remake", or a "rip-off". Towards the end, it goes completely its own way becoming more like The Empire Strikes Back. Let's start with the characters. It's great to see the old characters back in action. The Han and Leia scenes could have easily felt like they were just in there for nostalgia factor, but they feel natural and factor into the plot. Given the vast number of characters, it's amazing how very few of them feel shoe-horned in. There are three that I can think of who did, but all three of them are confirmed to be in the next one, so I'll get my fix then. However, the real standouts are the new characters. Adam Driver brings unexpected depth to Kylo Ren. Oscar Isaac is intensely likable as Poe Dameron. John Boyega is great as Finn. But the best is Daisy Ridley as Rey. She is going to be in so much more stuff, I guarantee. The chemistry between her and Finn was one of my favourite parts of the movie. The cinematography is incredible. The camera never moved around in the originals. Here, it follows around the action, capturing the feeling of playing with toys as a kid more perfectly than any movie before. It also just feels so much like Star Wars. Every sound and image is familiar. The movie has a real presence; the practical effects make it feel real. John Williams' new score is great, of course. He does a great job integrating the old with the new. In fact, that would be my summary of the movie. It pays enough homage to the original while setting up an exciting new story. I like how not everything is revealed by the end of this film. The final shot perfectly sums up all the questions we are left with and foreshadows what to come. It may be one of my favourite final shots of a movie ever. In conclusion, some people are going to hate on it for being too much like the originals, others are going to complain that it's not enough like them. Some will say too many questions were answered, others will say that not enough were. In the end, there are so many expectations riding on this film that it will never live up to everyone's hype. It's a minor miracle what JJ did. He had to bring in all of the old, set up a sprawling galaxy of new, establish what's been going on for 30 years between films, add humour, add drama, and somehow make it cohesive and fun. If you go in with the understanding that this is a movie, not the second coming, you will leave immensely satisfied.amazing return to the star wars universe We've waited.... and waited..... and here it is! The Force Awakens is everything we've come to love about Star Wars. It's big, it's epic, it's spectacular. And underneath, there's actually a big heart to it all. You get a sense from watching it, that it was made by true fans of the series. I won't give away any real spoilers- but rest assured Jar Jar Binks does not put in an appearance, so remain calm.  The good guys are very likable, I thought the relationship between Ray and Finn worked out very well. It gave the film it's emotional anchor.  The villains are pretty much what you would expect, but the filmmakers threw in a few twists about them that were interesting.  Add some terrific battle sequences, and you get a very welcome return to the greatness of Star Wars. Go and see it (but you already know you will). Take a friend or a family member. You'll have a great time. Because that's what these films are about when it comes down to it.  Overall, Force Awakens shows off some snazzy visual effects combined with a compelling story and great characters. It won't disappoint.mediocre Well, the first part of the movie is about ... the main protagonists meeting and then separating and meeting again. It really has this Harry Potter taste to it. It makes you want to feel that these characters are connected, but if they are it doesn't happen in this movie. The other part consists of pretty shots of dead spaceships in da desert and some terribly plastic epic moments of returning actors.  Which brings to the next point and it must be said; were dropped 30 years in the future with no clue as to what happened and no explanation of the current situation. Leia just appears almost solely to reinforce the feeling of continuation between the new and old cast, but we don't know anything of what she did in the last 30 years. Even worst for the antagonists. The 'new emperor' is a giant alien being with a terrible scar on his face. No explanation on who he is or how he got there. totally random. As for his apprentice, or the main villein for this movie he might as well be called Darth Malfoy or Darth Twilight. He is somewhat fragile, week, needy and maybe just a tad creepy and sneaky but that is really all that Adam Driver has to say in the movie. more on him later. Perhaps the worst part is the second half of the movie. At first, when they discuss their mission in the command room in the typical star wars pre battle briefing, I thought it was actually a joke. But no, they really have to destroy the deathstar, again, only this time its 10 times bigger. thats it. So basically the plot is harry potter meets a new hope. Going back to the antagonists, (because lets say it, the traitor stormtrooper, the lady skywalker and the ace pilot aren't particularly extravagant tropes) the big bad giant without a name, of a never seen before race whose rise to power has no explanation is just really a mass of pixels with 2 or 3 lines in the movie. His apprentice? is just a pig puzzle of... indecision. His attempt to seduce Rey to the dark side is.. laughable... and out of the blue.. just felt like it was added to the dialogue 'cos thats what star wars is'.  This movie is a mess, and the stunts were better in the later 3 episodes by Lucas. Not to mention, Most of the locations of this movie are real places on earth. Sand, Snow, and Iceland type islands. So much for the space opera.  Last but not least. Someone said this movie was witty... he's being paid to say so... It had none of the good humor some of the recent Disney movies had (lone ranger - john carter) the jokes and I laughed one or two times during the whole pic. The audience seemed to agree with me, no one was particularly exited on their way out, sure, it was almost 3 am Finally, the plot twist in the movie is ... 1) you know its coming 5 minutes before it happens. 2) It feels like they just did it to a) not have to deal with him anymore b) cos he wanted it since episode 5 c) to make a similarity with Obi One's death from a new hope (as if they alrady didn't take enough of that movies plot into this one..) BAH!...Felt like a Star Wars movie, But left me with a sense of disappointment *Spoilers* For months I've this movie has been hyped up, and as I stood in a queue that looked like it had neither a beginning nor end, I was buzzing with excitement like every other person in the queue. When STAR WARS flashed across the screen with the accompanying music that is universally known, I settled myself in for what was sure to be the best Star Wars movie yet....right? While the movie itself was very good, hence the 7/10 rating, there was something amiss. Everything was going great at the start, you're introduced to these fresh new characters that you know nothing about, but you're eager to learn everything about them, and by the time the movie finished, you knew that one of these would be your favorite, that you would emotionally connect with that character more than any other. But by the end of the movie, the only new character I can say that I felt the slightest bit emotionally connected to was BB-8. it had nothing to do with with the acting, which was actually rather good (with the exception of a certain princess/general and at times, kylo ren). no, the issue was you didn't know enough about the characters to feel emotionally invested in them. you get very little back-story on our new heroes/villains, and when you do, it is generally quite vague, I guess it helps the movie move a little faster, but would it hurt to sit the characters down for 5 minutes or so and actually explain to us who these characters really are? But they're saving that for the next movie some people might say, well that's fair enough, but I hope to god that it's worth waiting 2 years for. and lets not even start on characters that were probably just thrown in so Disney could put a name to the toy cough*Phasma*cough. The plot seemed awfully familiar (a new hope anyone?) and there were certain things that annoyed the s*** out of me. for example, the storm trooper that decided to desert, and now all of a sudden he can shoot straight, and he's able to go one on one with a reasonably trained sith for a good 5 minutes or so (regular storm trooper would last 5 seconds). and lets not mention the fact that rey suddenly turned into a jedi master, with no yoda. *major spoiler* I think the worst part for me was the death of Han Solo, I thought it was brilliant that he was killed off, don't get me wrong, I love the guy, but it's that shock factor and urge to cry that makes it so brilliant, if Finn had been killed, people probably wouldn't have been that bothered. No, the part that bothered me so much, was when Rey, Chewie and Finn returned to the resistance base, Leia sought solace over the loss of Han (she did't look too bothered tbh) with Rey, someone she has barely known for 5 minutes, while Chewie is left to mourn the loss of his best friend of more than 30 years on his own, not even a pat on the head for the guy, I mean come on. and where was the funeral? a last dignified goodbye for the guy we've wanted to be since we were kids. Vader got one, even Qui-gon got one. "He might still be alive" some might say. don't be so stupid, the guys in his 60's for crying out loud. he got impaled and got thrown overboard emperor style. falling down the last couple of stairs would have finished him off. To conclude, as much as I've ripped on it, it was still a very enjoyable movie. would I watch it again? yes. would i watch it dozens of times like previous star wars? probably not. Rant overStar Wars Awakens After thinking about the films for several hours after seeing it, and being initially disappointed. I can say that Star Wars the Force Awakens is well crafted film that captures the spirit of the original trilogy very well. The new cast members all perform well and create a new set of heroes and villains. Older cast members are also great especially Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Daisy Ridley as Rey. The film moves along at pace, similar to the first Star Wars film and is essentially a chase movie for the first hour of its run time. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is an interesting villain, which has conflicting issues to deal with, and is quite a nut case that has hissy fits. My main gripe with the film is the plot line of the Starkiller base, being too similar to the death star of the original trilogy. There was really no need for this plot line, just having Kylo Ren looking for Luke Skywalker was enough. Also would the rebellion not of known about the creation of such a base well before its construction? I also feel that Luke Skywalker would not abandon His truest friends, I do understand there is a lot gone on since Return of the Jedi that could of driven a wedge between their friendships. Luke however would of sensed what was going on with signals in the force and surely of helped, I feel his appearance was purely to set up the next film. Although the resistance claims victory it feels like a subdued win because of events of the attack on the Star killer base. The action is well filmed and the lightsaber battles are raw and feel dangerous. Overall this is a good film and a return to the film making beats of the original trilogy. It had unachievable hype to live up too, but the mix of old and new bond well, it is exciting to see what happens next in the Star Wars Saga....This movie awakens that good ol' feeling Finally there is a new Star Wars movie. This movie is easy to sum up without spoiling it. It is a roller-coaster ride throughout the whole movie. And yes, there are (a lot) of elements that summon a d√©j√† vu. But those elements made us fall in love with Star Wars in the first place and once again it made me fall in love with "The Force Awakens". I saw it yesterday in IMAX and I am still shaking. This is my first review because I owe it to JJ. I just want to let people know to go and watch this. And form your own opinion! Don't let negative people influence your judgment...Pessimism is a path to the dark side. Stay true and may the Force be with you.It's Our Fault, We Asked For This! After 10 years - or 32, depending on your regard for the legitimacy of the prequel trilogy - Star Wars is back, and, in the spirit of times, as Giuseppe DI Lampedusa would have put it, it was necessary for everything to change in order for it to remain the same: new studio, new team, new characters... new expanded universe even (more on that later). It's funny then, and sadly not at all surprising, that so many things remain the same as in 1977. The Empire has survived, in the form the The First Order, and the rebellion is now the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa. A soul-searching stormtrooper (Boyega) saves ace resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Isaac) and important info stored in a droid and stages an escape to a desolate desert planet... Well, if echoes of Episode IV are already a bit startling, it gets worse. It quickly becomes clear why so many directors turned down this dream assignment, as Episode VII isn't as much a chance to play in George Lucas' sandbox as a remake of his original opus. Blame Disney. Blame J. J. Abrahms, he's certainly done this before... the fault, it turns out, is yours. After the dismal prequels, chock-block of new ideas, some good, some bad, most of them executed horribly, we've howled for movies that resembled the originals more that Disney would have been suicidal to approve anything more original than this, and history will judge Episode VII on how much it emboldens the studio to be more daring, or whether it just confirms the need to just "give fans what they want", more of the same. Time will tell, but, to quote our heroes, I have a bad feeling about this. What is annoying this time, after the utter cluelessness of Episodes I-III, is the very real talent on display here. The old characters could have stood silently in the background, paychecks safely cashed, but they make a mark, particularly Harrison Ford as Solo, more touching and involved here than he has been for at least a decade. The new characters are just as involving and appealing, particularly John Boyega's Finn and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. Andy Serkis also makes an impression. Otherwise, the humor is back and it's a thrill to see J.J. Abrams work a scene after the inane telenovela-like blocking of the prequels. And still, this could have been much more, and our only consolation will have to be that it could have also been worse. The greatest question is, what comes next? Tonally, we are squarely back in original trilogy mode, the only limit will be the appeal of the characters (mostly successful here) and the caliber of the stories (not so much). It is a bit worrying that Disney has jettisoned all the expanded universe, both because it might set an ugly precedent, and because it does show a fear of risk and cynical approach to a very valuable brand.  And yet... we might be wrong: what little transparency has been displayed so far might be completely honest. It was George Lucas himself who, in an interview, said Disney had rejected all his outlines saying that they wanted to make "one for the fans". Well, this describes Episode VII perfectly. If we could have some fresh ideas with our next helping, we'd truly be thrilled.Don't listen to the haters! It's a shame to see so many people complaining about how similar this was to episode IV and how it feels simply like a reboot. Maybe there are points where the homage becomes extreme, but it still ticks almost all the boxes of a movie-goer. The film itself looks and feels amazing, with all the touches of old, including numerous new and old aliens lurking in the background to give it that classic star wars universe feel. Obviously as in any film there are ways you could pick at it, maybe the humour is excessive? Maybe it could be more original? But at the end of the day it will leave you laughing, crying and cheering, all in good measure. Star Wars is back with a bang, and episode VII makes it feel like it's never really been gone.Boycott the new Star Wars movie! I've never asked for my money back for any movie in my life until know! Without ruining the movie for anyone... the main start is a female Jedi (Rey) which had her usually passive aggressive attitude towards all men (Feminist behaviour) and "I can look after myself." I was going to walk out until Harrison Ford made an entrance and played his alpha self. Of course Rey comes along and tells Harrison Ford how to run his ship for him! You can see him wanting to tell her to shut the %@#$ up but her pulls out his Feminist agenda card cause he doesn't want to be ridiculed by the Galaxy media and lose his job! The bad guy was great for only 5 mins but after running into Rey he turns into a major beta just like the storm trooper Finn. I was a star wars fan until now! Everything that was star wars is in my bin now! If you want to see a bullshit "woman in power" and all men bowing down to her, go see the new Star Wars!Something, something, something, dark side. Something, something, something, complete¬Ö It's as if millions of Star Wars fans suddenly cried out in criticism and were suddenly silenced ‚Äì as that's the effect this movie should have on most (other than those fanatics who were bound to be disappointed/hate it no matter what). For all the SANE Star Wars fans out there, I'm happy to report that the Force is strong with this series once again (after taking a walk on the dark side with the prequels). All other shoddy imitations take note ‚Äì THIS is how you do a space opera. The Force Awakens possesses everything that was missing from the soulless prequels ‚Äì we have a non-snooze-worthy storyline, likable new characters, great acting, non-cringe-worthy dialogue and not such a reliance on only CGI effects/green-screen. The pluses of this movie are in abundance, starting with what's new. All those with reservations about the fresh young actors cast to play new characters Rey and Finn should sit back, relax and watch the beautiful chemistry between the two as their characters form a friendship/dynamic on screen (which they also seem to share off- screen) that rivals that of the original trio. Daisy Ridley more than proves she's up to the challenge of letting a large portion of the new trilogy rest on her shoulders. Her Rey is a scavenger with a good heart (as evidenced by her coming to the rescue of BB-8, a droid carrying something important on him). Whilst certain people (who for some unfathomable reason don't like seeing a woman who can handle herself) may take this new female lead (who is smart, brave, kind and just all around awesome) as a personal affront to them, for the rest of us who *don't* hate seeing a woman take centre stage, this is what we've been looking for in a female character for so long. She's everything you could hope for...but not without her faults, as she does make occasional mistakes ‚Äì but not enough you hate her for it. She's flawed, but SO much more interesting because of this. Ridley imbues her character with so much heart and soul, conveys a lot with just looks and even shows she's adept at humour as well. Most importantly, she's likable, forming instant friendship with other characters who we already like (so we know she's awesome). Any gripes about her would be for petty reasons/nitpick-y. Sharing her responsibility of being one of the new faces of this trilogy is John Boyega as Finn ‚Äì a former Stormtooper who refuses to go along with the rest when he witnesses them do something terrible. It's after this that he meets Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron, who he forms an almost-immediate friendship with. Out of the three new leads, Isaac's Poe is probably given the least development, but he manages to make it believable that he and Finn become close friends in such a short space of time. The best dynamic, though, is without a doubt the one formed between Rey and Finn. The way they play off each other with such ease is thanks in large parts to the actors, but also the dialogue is snappy and quick-witted. They share a fun friendship that becomes quite close, but is always believable due to the actors truly inhabiting their roles/believing in who they're playing as well as the universe they're a part of (where characters talk/act in a unique way). One of many things the prequels sadly lacked was heart, but this movie/these characters have it in spades. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren picks up where Darth Vader left off as our main villain this time around and is clearly devoted to his memory (since he talks to the burnt mask of him, as seen in the trailers). Driver is quite good at playing the bad guy, though he is prone to the occasional 'hissy fit' with his crossguard lightsaber which verges into slightly over-the-top/petulant teenager behavior. Thankfully, when the big moments occur, Driver shows real emotion/conflict within his character. His lightsaber duel, first with Finn and then Rey, is everything the prequel duels were lacking. They may've had the needless fancy twirling and whatnot, but here we have rough and tumble, gritty fights between someone skilled and two people who are only just learning what they're capable of. Plus there's real emotional investment, which helps. It's an epic battle with tension ‚Äì which is a BIG plus with this movie: we don't know what's going to happen. Of course it's good to see our old favourites back. Han, Chewie, Leia, R2-D2, C-3PO, even the Millennium Falcon ‚Äì all of these received applause at my screening. Those claiming this film relies on nostalgia/good will towards the original films alone are mistaken. Whilst the prequels included familiar characters/moments just for the sake of callbacks, what they do here is much more satisfying. Han's his usual charming, funny, "scruffy-looking nerf-herder" self, but he forms attachments to our new characters, and his dynamics with them allows for some of the film's best moments. The movie certainly has humour, but thankfully it's not the "cutsie" nauseating variety found in the prequels. There's genuinely funny moments for young and old alike.  J.J. Abrams has been unfairly criticised, when he should be receiving thanks for bringing the Star Wars Saga back from the brink/re-energising it after the prequels. So what if there's some familiarity? My only quibbles were Domhnall Gleeson's shouting/performance, the somewhat hit-and-miss soundtrack, and Andy Serkis' CGI Supreme Leader Snoke - since, in most other instances, Abrams ensured that (along with story/character development) locations/miniatures/practical effects and make-up took precedence over a reliance on CGI/things that simply 'looked cool'. The sequels have their work cut out for them in matching this thrilling/exciting, enjoyable and satisfying first chapter of a new era in the saga, but if this film's anything to go by, the next two should be safe in the hands. Finally, we have a new hope. What more could anyone (without impossible standards) wish for?Good Movie! Dumb Reviews! Okay, I'm coming straight off the bat and saying that this was a really entertaining movie - period. It's not perfect but it is definitely an excellent film with lots of great aspects. The acting, screenplay, directing were all well above average (especially when you consider how terrible the prequels were). It had a wonderful sense of fun and borrowed a bit from it's predecessors (I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing as the originals were awesome). I felt it was a worthy successor to the original Star Wars movies. I have literally waited a lifetime to see what would happen after episode six and I wasn't disappointed. That is a huge achievement in itself. And better yet it has helped rid me of the painful memories of Mr Lucas trying to ruin the originals by 'updating' them and of course, those God awful prequels. I felt this movie was strongest in the first and last thirds of the film with the middle being a tad clunky. That being said I am not complaining. Actually the only thing I will complain about is some of the reviews I read on IMDb this morning. What kind of an idiot could sit through this movie and then only give it one star! I believe everyone has the right to an opinion but seriously, some reviewers here are completely off the mark. If a movie has a bad script or painful acting (like the prequels or The Room) by all means crucify it in your review. But if a movie has a good level of humour, interesting characters, a good tempo, a plot, solid acting, a little bit of intrigue, then don't review it poorly just because you can. I would go so far as to say that anyone who has given a review with below five stars for this movie has no idea what constitutes a good movie and should be ignored. My little rant over, I'll just say this movie was a worthy addition to the Star Wars universe (or multiverse now that the books don't count). I left the movie last night feeling very emotional as one of my childhood dreams had finally come to fruition. I hope when you see it you feel like I did and that you don't get put off by people with no idea about how to review a film.Surrogate Star Wars: Competent but shallow trope-fest fails to recapture magic of originals There is an essence of Star Wars that has made it more than just a film, but rather the dominant myth of our culture. That is the promise of adventure, the depth of its world, and the resonance of its central drama and spiritual struggle. All these can transcend shoddy dialogue, pat storytelling, and intermittent tonal missteps. With its evocative title, in the opening scenes The Force Awakens promises to rediscover the magic, if mainly because these are new characters in fresh settings. The interaction between the winsome Boyega, Ridley and BB8, while basic, is spirited, and the still- masked Kylo Ren promises to be a nuanced, powerful presence. An entire galaxy awaits. But the moment Harrison Ford walks into the Millennium Falcon ‚Äì to applause of recognition from the first-night audience - all the possibilities are extinguished.  Suddenly, we are watching an unsolicited tag-on to a story that has already been told. What were once heroes in their prime going through the most vital moments of their lives, are now physically unconvincing pensioners, caked in make-up and CGI, reliving them in a manner that appears forced, sorry, and vaguely undignified. The protagonists of the original trilogy could have been an alluring myth on the outskirts of the narrative, or shuttled in for an effective cameo ‚Äì nostalgic or heroic ‚Äì but placing them at the heart of the new film constricts and misshapes it. With Han, Leia and Luke on-board, the plot sets a familiar course, though having to accommodate both old and new protagonists and stories within the scope of one film, the pacing and structure are often jumpy, and the set ups and payoffs lack dramatic weight. More generally, with its endless inter-generational family dramas and ever-bigger Death Stars to be destroyed through the exploitation of an engineering vulnerability, the main storyline of Star Wars risks collapsing into self-parody. A scene such as Kylo Ren praying to the desiccated helmet of Darth Vader, is written to summon a chill of history, and gasps of awe, but could as easily elicit pretension- bursting laughter. Yet the film's creators do not shy away from the tropes, but embrace them. George Lucas ‚Äì he of the "rhyming stanzas" ‚Äì could claim proud ownership of the tiresome symmetries, plot recycling and continuity porn of The Force Awakens. But Chewbacca, cantinas, solo enemy base escapes, the Millennium Falcon do not bring back the feeling of Star Wars, and instead every new laboured coincidence introducing familiar elements only makes the galaxy seem smaller, and diminishes that lure of the unknown that made the original trilogy what it is. But the new elements the makers of The Force Awakens have brought to the saga also show that they appear to have an unsteady grasp of the fundamental appeal of the old films. Formally, director JJ Abrams studiously avoids the CGI-heavy feel of Episodes I to III, replicating the physical presence of the originals. Yet he also adds a gloss and a busyness to the proceedings that strips Star Wars of its depth, something Lucas always strove towards, even when he was unable to skilfully establish it. We visit several worlds, but there is little wonder, as plot dominates over atmosphere. There is no time for binary sunsets, or the swamps of Dagobah here, and as a result world of the film seems shallower, almost consciously so, with greater emphasis on the diet of wisecracks and blaster shots. In fact, the unpropitious mix of the old and the new, brings nothing so much to mind as fan fiction, or a lesser Star Wars game. The film seems over-familiar and full of fanservice, but also strangely "off" ‚Äì off-brand and off-kilter - parsecs away from the authentic soul of the saga.  As an experience, The Force Awakens is not unenjoyable, though it seems less fun the longer it goes on, and those fans enthusiastically cheering every familiar object in the first half, gave only a half-hearted smattering of applause at the end. But it fails, and barely tries to live up to the promise of Star Wars. Heavy narrative baggage, and endless outside commercial and production considerations do not necessarily align with making the best Star Wars movie possible. And while it is evident that the film was made with painstaking effort, the restrictions those behind it placed on themselves were too great to craft an enchanting new story. The makers of The Force Awakens will see it as transitional episode, and hope that the young characters will truly take flight in the next episode and beyond, but the tractor beam of the past may be too strong, and their thrusters too underpowered.This is a big let down but why are we surprised? Where to start from? I do not even know how to explain this film. Let me first say that I am one of the BIGGEST fans of Star Wars. I even like Jar Jar... but this, this is not Jar jar, this is not even star wars. This is some space film with star wars characters in it... I cannot call it a remake, because a remake is something that duplicates the old one trying to make it look better. It would of been actually nice if they had made a remake. Ohhh Disney we would buy your toys anyway, no need for this type of rubbish. OK too much negativism... Let me actually do a proper review.. I am just too disappointed. Now positives: 1. I liked the main characters (Fin and Rey) 2. I love that the old characters were in there although we saw Luke only for a minute. Why was he not in the trailer.. The answer is because he was not in this movie, he was reserved for the next one. 3. CGI was good, not the best but still good. 4. Costumes were first-class. 5. Camera was good... 6. The cast was good, I liked the actors chosen for this film, apart from the villains but this is for the negative bits of the review. 7. It is called Star Wars and Han is there as well ... 8. Mystery .Who is who? I think this is pretty much all the positive stuff in this film...  Negatives:  1. Villains are a joke ...One ugly, funny looking supreme leader and a Sith lord with big ears, childish looking and funny Robot mask that must change the voice. Ohh I want to be like my grandfather... But i will never be... Ohh man i can go on and on...  2. 30 X fighters take on a 100000 bad ass space ships and actually win... it was fine for 1977 but its a bit too much to repeat the story again and say it is a brand new.story.. As i said we cannot call it a remake 3. We want more Jedi stuff and more light saber fights ... And please just please Disney do not ever use this Cross light saber that looks more like I made it myself type of light saber...  4. NOW IMPORTANT THING ... Where the hell is the story... Seriously ... a droid keeping secret that is not of any use because R2 D2 is hibernating... then a storm trooper who wants to be a good guy and also falls in love with a Jedi wanna be... A brother and sister (Rey) and The funny mask guy ... but we still do not know that and we do not know how are they related... Then she is waiting for her family but they are never coming back.. she never had a Jedi training but yet again she nearly killed an experienced Sith Lord. Ohh well he was injured but who cares he is trained for this S..t!!! OK they wanted to leave many questions for the next film but this is not the way to do so. There are much clever ways of doing it... Like stating the obvious but leaving it open so the audience can only guess. This is boldly stupid... Like i do not know that Luke is going to train her... and that funny alien looking villain wanna be will take that funny mask guy to finish off his training... Chubaka is going to be Rey's right hand ... Luke is going to die at some point but he is very powerful.. Leia is realising this little girl is her daughter ... The storm trooper is madly truly and deeply in love with her ... Oh they might add the twist and she might fall in love with the pilot instead and feel the black dude more of a brother instead.... Guys you could of build up the story and leave the action for the next episode.  5. The death of Han Solo... Guys please ... How the hell did you even allow this to happen.. Killed by his son on some stupid bridge with a cross light saber that he is holding... No proper conversation, no explanation ... just... OH let me stab my dad and let him fly off the bridge ... nicely. after 6 episodes we decide to kill one of the most lovable characters without even leaving him the chance to fight... Ohh yeah this is because he would never fight his ugly big eared son... Pathetic ... Then Leia felt it .. R2 D2 also felt it and woke up... Nice ..... Luke is just chilling out on a funny rocky planet ... Meditating ...  6. Everyone is looking for Luke ... wow nice ... So what would happen if they find him.. Kill him? Kiss him? Ohh wait turn him into the dark side... Or the funny alien wants to fight him... Well good luck with that.  7. The republic (Why the hell did you destroy the republic so easy) Seriously guys this is even out of order. I am tired of giving negative feedback. There is so much more that I can say about this film. You guessed it folks I won't do it. Just because I love Star Wars all 6 of them even the first one. Do you know why? Because there is story, it is original and there is everything that we need, although not as good as the old 3 films still Star Wars. Out of respect I give 2 stars. Will I watch this again, probably not. Will i watch the next one. Yes I will but I will not have such high expectations. We all know how this ends.There has been an awakening... Spoilers within. The first words out of Han Solo's mouth are "Chewie, we're home". And I think that The Force Awakens has made me feel the same way, against all the odds. The world of Jakku is immediately familiar to all those who watched Luke gaze at the twin suns of Tattoine for the first time in 1977. There are some gorgeous shots of unspeakable scale of a decayed Death Star lying in the desert sands that immediately speak 'aged future' much like the original trilogy did. And the scavenger in Rey, played with moxie and endearing ferocity by Daisy Ridley, reminds me of a similar explorer, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. She too explores the husk of a broken, long forgotten world.  The plot too is familiar, perhaps overly so, by Lawrence Kaskan. Once again the Jedi have faded into mystery, and the Empire has manifested into yet another legion ruling over the systems with its might. The opening scrawl is less impressive and otherworldly as it once was with this in mind. We have another Vader, another Han Solo, another secret Sith master who hides in the shadows and speaks of vague evils...and as we close, we search for another Jedi master much like Luke did for Yoda. And there is another gigantic Death Star needing to be exploded in spectacular fashion.  It is then with futility that Han Solo bids his goodbye to Star Wars. He falls in an identical manner to Obi Wan, with friends desperately onlooking, and cut down by someone close who has given way to the dark side. This is troubling because not only is Kylo Ren played unconvincingly, where his most vulnerable moments without his helmet give way to the plain face of Adam Driver, spouting a boy band haircut and shouting of the Dark Side without much actual justification for why he defected, but also because it veers dangerously close to the same redemption path of Vader himself. To redo that story with a fraction of the conflict and without a hint of backstory would be unsatisfying.  He does not have the backing power of the Imperial March theme as Vader once did, but demonstrates his terror in other ways. The sound design and visual and special effects are fantastic as expected. The first showing of the force suspends a blaster beam in mid-air, and the lightsabers make the entire frame tremble, and fills the theatre with that unmistakable hum, buzzing and crackling with deadly red force. Overhead, entire planets are destroyed without mercy. The markets of Jakku and the watering rebel hole are created with ease, although with nothing as iconic as the Cantina Band. Less impressive is the JJ Abrams method of obscuring his action scenes with his trademark smoke and sparks that seem pervasive throughout the galaxy. Like his Mission Impossible movies, sparks are literally everywhere a fight occurs, even as lightsabers cut up frozen trees and blasters are fired at rocks and dirt. As the Millennium Falcon takes flight, whip pans and shaky-cam are a tad overused. At times, the action is rendered unwatchable.  The best performance is Ridley's Rey, who is tough and vulnerable and capable. Joining her is Boyega's Finn, whose story arc is natural (maybe made a little ridiculous when blood is smeared on a stormtrooper's helmet, which are newer and sleeker but still not a substitute for an actual face) and whose comedic timing and chemistry with his co-star make them very easy to root for. Equally as good is BB-8, who brings the same charm and humour to the group much like R2D2 originally did. Isaac's Poe is charismatic enough, although no Han Solo. The worst belong to Christie's Phasma, whom is given as many lines as Boba Fett, and an imposing shiny suit, but never so much as fires a blaster and is irrelevant. Gleeson's Hux is also forgetful, save for a riveting speech to his battalions where his face quivers with maniacal anticipation and bloodlust. And it seems that Supreme Leader Snoke is overcompensating with big evil dialogue and a transmitter that portrays him as towering and monstrous. Ah yes, he is finally going to complete his training. Never heard that one before. I got chills as the iconic score and scrawl opened the movie, and I very much want to see it again. I think that is the most important thing with Star Wars.The Force Awakens captures the Spirit and Magic of Star Wars In a galaxy far, far away¬Ö Star Wars. It's about time we should see that opening to a film. 10 years since the last Star Wars Film, J.J Abrams takes the time to get it right. And he does it perfectly. I won't say anything about the plot, because I'm sure you want to find what it is yourself. But I will tell you of a New, Epic Adventure.  The Force Awakens gets it right. It blends old and new together in a way the prequel Trilogy really failed to do. We had new characters( Finn, Rey, Poe, Kylo Ren, BB-8) and old ( Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, C3PO, R2-D2), that combined together to make a fitting and suitable Stars Wars film that would make George Lucas Proud. The Force Awakens doesn't make the mistake of copying everything awesome about the original trilogy, but it respects and honours it. It makes its only original story, and it really is quite a great story. But that's enough of me, I think you would rather see this Fantastic Film then listen to me ramble on about it¬ÖFresh and as exciting as watching the first Star Wars 38 Years Ago Just from a packed first showing @ 12:01 am in Exeter, UK of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (in 3D). Remarkably I saw the first in 1977 on a first showing, and subsequent ones in between. Probably makes me a geek &amp; definitely a Star Wars fan, however I did go to this viewing with some trepidation. New director, main characters, different studio.... could they keep it fresh and maintain the well worked recipe of success the previous six, George Lucas had conjured up? The answer is J. J. Abrams &amp; crew produced a total success,obviously created with love and affection of watching previous versions. Great story with continuity of the Star Wars saga, new graphics / CGI, but with a perfect blend of old characters with new, yet the familiar Star Wars places and technology. A must see on the big screen, especially in 3d, for young and old whether a fan of the previous films or not. I can guarantee no one will be bored. Thanks Disney, and will book for a first showing for the follow up. Next year?Disappointing I don't even know where to start with this. It was obvious JJ Abrams had never bothered watching any of the previous movies or there wouldn't have been so many mistakes such as, when the f**k has anyone ever seen a 2 man TIE Fighter. Then you get some random sand junkie who has never piloted before but manages to fly the Millennium Falcon as if she was a Battle of Britain vet. The acting between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher was wooden, especially since they had kids together. As much as I hated the Phantom Menace for all its flaws and Ja Ja Binkses, It towers above this movie as the plot makes absolutely no sense what so ever as a carry on from episode VI. I had been looking forward to this film for a long time, but it looks like Disney is just trying to cash in on a well loved franchise with cheap un-humorous jokes without taking in any of the previous films that it is supposed to supersede.R U kidding me JJ?  SPOILER ALERT This is even too good grade for this movie but its based on that I was sure Kylo will spare his father Han Solo but he killed him, rest of it was a joke Rey finds out in this particular movie she is Force sensitive and after 30 minutes without any training she is ready to confront Kylo Ren and she almost killed him. WTF?! Also light-saber fights are super slow, like we are back in 70' not in 2015. This movie is a joke for everyone who watched all 6 previous episodes For me personally movie is too focused on trooper fights , I would like to see more light - saber fights but that is just my opinion CGI s look great , starship fights absolutely great but that is not their credit that much , it is just technological advancementutter money making bull Without doubt the worst and most disappointing film I have ever seen. There is no way that anyone looked at this films script and thought anything other than the amount of money they would make on a terrible film. How it has such high reviews I have no idea. I'm half expecting some sort of protest or parliamentary legislation to come through giving everyone a full refund out of the dirt bag money grabbing creators own pockets. So much expectation and ignorance from me and any other disappointed fans on release day but to anyone who considers buying the DVD after the general view of the film has come out, it's your own fault. If my own mother was on her last legs and had only 2 hours and 15 minutes left to live and wanted me to sit and watch it with her while she slowly passed, I would let her die on her own rather than watching this film again. Very very annoyed, countless inconsistencies, rushed story and very poor acting. Ruined star warsCasual watchers will love it but die hard fans will be torn. I want to begin this by saying I'm not a massive fan of the franchise. I've watched all of the saga and really enjoyed them as a kid, and I was actually quite looking forward to this installment. The film boasts a plethora of exhilarating action scenes and fantastic visuals but its narrative, writing and character development is where it lacks. The story takes parts of the previous plots and freshens them up with some new faces and some quality CGI but it all seems too familiar and predictable. The characters are just dull. They show no real personality and personally, I just didn't care about them enough to want them to survive the ordeal. It was great to see the old cast make a reappearance but it seemed extremely forced; they proved barely nothing to the actual plot and seemed like they were there just to appease fans of the old series. Also, the new villain is probably one of the most uninspired characters in the saga; a tasteless being with a bipolar accent between American, Scottish and Irish and a reused backstory. The main narrative is a loose repeat of 'A New Hope' but it wasn't executed as well and just dragged on for the 2 hour and 15 minute runtime. The writing wasn't great. I feel like since Disney got their hands on the franchise, they've completely encapsulated it by adding ridiculous amounts of comedy in a way that comes off as slapstick and seems way too modern and contrasts the serious moments terribly. Overall, I think that the new generation are gonna love it because it's harmless fun and it's a predominantly young cast. I also think it's a great platform for the new actors who are all relatively unknown but I think dedicated fans are gonna have a very 'Marmite' opinion of this; they'll either love it or disregard it entirely. Me, personally, think the saga should've ended with Return of the Jedi.A remake of episode IV Story: the script written by Abraams himself along with Lawrence Kasdan (who co-wrote "Empire" and "Jedi") is a solid block of fan service towards Episode IV. It follows identical story patterns - desert planet, kid ready to go off on adventure, mentor comes along the way,etc - but some nice (humorous) twists left and right. Although it delivers with no cringe-worthy scenes, Abraams seems to be focused too much in "New Hope" as he tries avoid the (hilarious) wrath of the internet fan boys. Whereas this is not necessarily a bad decision, it would be been a greater challenge to try to distinguish his film from old ties and allow himself to follow our (old and new) heroes in different settings rather than familiar ones. Of course, this is Star Wars, it had never been about breaking the rules or groundbreaking story material, it is all about family relationships.  Themes: The character interaction is worth the price of the admission alone and it is simply magical to see all those icons that you love talking to each. Main focus here remains the connections between them and the family ties that each one may carry on their shoulders. It had always been a eye catching dynamic that has been explored in the last six films successfully - how Luke reacts to his father's news, how Anakin is going to save Padme, etc - and if it is not broken why fix it? Abraams knows he has a goldmine of characters the audience is willing to see in action surrounded by love, betrayal, friendship, care and heroism and commits rightfully so. Characters: Episode VII boasts a phenomenal cast - from the main protagonist duo to the film's primary villain. It's a pleasure to have Harrison Ford back as Han Solo with the most scene stealing moments and his chemistry with Fisher and Mayhew (Chewbacca) still holds strong since 1983. It is evident that Ford is having a blast at the iconic role and it seems that it has not passed a day since the concluding events of the "Return of the Jedi". Carrie Fisher has little screen time (unexpectedly) but does justice to the material and regarding Mark Hamill's appearance much cannot be said without giving anything away. Among the newcomers, Daisy Ridley makes a strong impact - likable, fierce and vulnerable - she brings a freshness to the Star Wars myths by being almost at the center of the story in a rather dominant boy- ish series. John Boyega is surprisingly charismatic (and amps the humor to 11!) although his character is rather blunt sometimes and feels like filler. Other wellknown cast members are either minimized cameos - Max Von Sydow, Gwendoline Christie come to mind, what a waste!, or glorified ones - looking at you Oscar Isaac. and this is where the film mostly crumbles. An overabundance of characters offer almost nothing at the proceedings instead they are used as an excuse to move the plot forward. It is admirable that Abraams tries to recreate a vivid world of Star Wars but at one point, we are not caring for most of them as they carry almost no significance or dramatic weight. Villain: The best element in the film, main player here is Kylo Ren portrayed by Adam Driver. A rather menacing (and badass) presence, his story arc is by far the most interesting with some nifty emotional touches. Driver plays Ren's obsession/confusion to perfection and surely has the most development in the movie. Not only, he summarizes what is wrong with the dark side, tiny little details regarding his emotional attributes build up his character without requiring much heavy handed exposition or long monologues. At this part, Abraams and Co have succeeded tremendously and Driver's performance carries a dramatic (and tragic) weight reminding the glory of "Revenge of the Sith"'s final act. Direction: Abraams' direction is solid, dynamic and evidently from the Star Trek entries serviceable with similar blended display of CGI and practical effects. However, despite the presence of some inspiring dog fight sequences, Abraams seems to struggle with the lightsaber battle suffering from close ups and intense edit despite the atmospheric setting. It is always good to see no lens flare! - thank you for that - and him trying to keep consistent with the visual flare of the previous films. Following George Lucas's directing (and static) style with a bit of more dramatic movement in the space scenes feels like a natural evolution for a modern entry in the SW canon. Particularly, there is a wonderful shot of Finn fighting his way through a Stormtrooper squad while on the background Dameron is blasting lasers on Tie-fighters. Brilliant. however, it does not bring back any memorable moments due to his insistence to follow the patterns of Episode IV. Although there is a clear enthusiasm, he gets caught in his own excitement to recreate probably his nostalgia. All six films boasted some truly memorable set pieces (Vader vs Luke in Empire, Duel of the fates scene, pd race, Emperor confrontation in Jedi) or visual style (who can forget the almost renaissance like lava landscapes of Mustafar?), yet here, despite the state of the art talent involved, the films feels more a fan service checklist rather than a fully fleshed out adventure. Despite being a technical thrill and a treat for the holiday season, Episode VII though lacks any emotional punch while it is focused on pulling off the nostalgia flag rather than initiate excitement with something new. Abraams has done a serviceable job as the franchise's first helmer with adequate action scenes and a great cast. He falls short though as he sidelines interesting personalities, events and mini plots threads at the expense of the fan service with a blink and you miss ending that sets up further entries.A Brand New Hope After months of eagerly awaiting the star wars franchise to return and with mostly high hopes from the director "J.J.Abrams" I returned home from the midnight release of this classic movie with feelings a movie hasn't made me feel in a very long time. I returned home quickly removing my t shirt to cool down from the sweaty grip of the cinema screen, feeling almost relieved that it was over but desperately wanting more. The curtains widened and the classic rolling yellow letters appeared on screen accompanied by "John Williams" iconic soundtrack and after that everything fell into place. The return of everyone's favorite characters created immense amounts of nostalgia and I couldn't help but have a big cheesy grin on my face every time a familiar face appeared. The new cast were equally as good as the oldies and an exceptional performance from "Oscar Isaac" as to be expected, these new performances really held the movie together. The characters the new cast played were brilliant and fitted in great with the star wars story. The main winning point for this movie is the sheer fact that it most definitely is Star Wars, from start to finish it was good old Star Wars, Bravo.Star Wars: The Force Awakens - a eulogy I just came back from a midnight screening and i have to tell you how it went. There are no spoilers in this piece because it's impossible to spoil this film. There are no words....sorry i have to rephrase...there is no language known to man to describe my shock and utter disgust upon watching this abomination. I'm a middle aged man in my forties and i have watched thousands of movies in my lifetime. This one is by far , by a million miles, the worst movie i had ever the discomfort to endure. It was a disgrace. I believe there is no original idea in the script, not a single one! If you have ever watched "Star Wars: A new hope" don't bother. Its indistinguishable from this one. Its a total rip-off. At one point i wanted to cut my right arm of and f*** myself with my detached limb to distribute the pain evenly. It was unbearable. If it wasn't for the mercy killing towards the end i would have left the theater. My eyes were burning from witnessing the greatest debacle of the film industry since...since...since when actually? Nothing comes to mind! For the first time in my life i heard an audience booing at the end mixed with sighs of relief. About half of the people left early. Oh, how i envy those lucky bastards. Anger and disbelief followed by growing numbness of the face. If you are suicidal watch this film! It gives hope to the the hopeless,cause you truly know what rock bottom is after watching it. There is no point in criticizing specific aspects of the film. Its a total failure across-the-board. Its an all- encompassing disaster of epic proportions. Decades from now people will stand in awe reading pages after pages of inconsistencies meticulously collected by former fans of the franchise. A last service rendered to one of the greatest stories ever told. Star Wars died today. And in the end, it was a relief. Years from now, when you look back on your life you will remember Star Wars as something best described by John and Paul: "And in the end, the love you take Is equal to the love you make."It is not a sequel, but a remake Sad but true. When the opening credits filled the screen (Episode VII... blah blah) I was already grinding my teeth because the plot sounded idiotic. Then the huge star destroyer filled the screen. The fun bit is that the star destroyer had some sort of antenna or whatever at the front and it looked liked the ship was showing the middle finger towards the viewers.  I have to congratulate the film makers as that was pretty much how the film worked from that point forward.  1) A droid has important information that must be delivered to the good guys (Episode IV, anyone?) 2) so the bad guys hunt for the droid on a desert planet (IV)  3) Storm troopers raid a village, killing everyone (IV)  4) A girl is captured by the bad guys and the good guys rush to the base to the rescue. (IV)  5) The girl and the boy have a friend zone relationship through the film (Ep IV, Luke &amp; Leia, wouldn't be surprised to learn that they are siblings in Episode IX)  6) The stormtroopers, elite soldiers of the bad guys, still can't hit a barn door. On the other hand, the good guys always hit, even when they use a weapon for the first time in their life  7) Supreme Leader Snoke = Emperor with a silly name  8) The bad guys have a magnificent new weapon that can destroy planets (Ep IV)  9) They use it to destroy a planet loyal to the rebels (IV)  10) The weapon has shields that can be destroyed by going down on the planet and disabling the shield generator (VI)  11) The epic villain wears a mask that distorts his voice (IV) and sadly, looks better with the mask on than without it. 12) The good guys can only destroy the weapon with an attack by X-Wings on the exact target (IV)  13) The X-Wings have to fly in a tight trench in order to reach their target (IV) The screen writers had absolutely no new ideas to show for their money. A bunch of monkeys could have written better dialogue. A 1st grader could have made a plot that had less holes in it. The special effects were pretty much of the same quality as in the first Star Wars movie that was released 1977. I'd expect something way better in 2015.Star Wars: The Force Gets Boring Have you ever disagreed with someone about the quality of a production so intensely that you've wondered if the two of you even watched the same film? I'm sorry, everyone in the world, I thought The Force Awakens was a real snoozer. I'm not surprised that my eight year old nephew loved it, but I can't for the life of me figure out why the adults I associate with aren't offended at what we've been offered by Abrams as the continuation of the world's foremost loved space epic.  Essentially what it feels like is a reboot of the original series, except this time for kids (no surprise there, Disney), not a meaningful continuation that picks up where the originals left off. Although I did start having my doubts about my future satisfaction with the Star Wars franchise when Disney made its Star Wars paraphernalia so pervasive that one morning I found myself unconsciously buttering my toast with DeathStar Margarine Spread¬©. Yeah‚Äîhead trip, but I got over it.  There was virtually zero discussion within the movie itself as to what happened after episode Vl and how we got to where we are now, making this production feel like a desperate lurch to be a stand-alone and to appeal to an audience who is too young to have appreciated the Spice Girls let alone the originals. This direction may be satisfying for some, but for those of us who were expecting more will find ourselves disappointed. Furthermore, I was saddened by the obvious deficiency surrounding the exploration of the mythology of the Force. One of the elements that so intrigued viewers about the originals was the underlying spirituality and the metaphysical forces at play within the Star Wars universe; however, in this version of Star Wars Abrams seems to care more about the characters ceaselessly running away from things and having meaningless, often silly conversation (like in one scene the character Finn asks Rey in the goofiest way possible if she has a boyfriend‚ÄîI laughed but I was so ashamed) instead of exploring the depths of some of the most intriguing supernatural philosophy in all of moviedom. However, this fact is not surprising as the masses seem to be entertained predominantly by action, comedy, flashing lights, and explosions, not exploring the psychological latitudes of light and dark within the human soul, and definitely not sitting through slow scenes of dialogue which could (God forbid) give us an understanding of the depths of the Star Wars legend and mystery. I suppose in this regard (and in too many others) Abrams gave the people what they wanted. Not only was the confined exploration of the Force disappointing but so was the serious lack of emotional poignancy. At no point, AT LITERALLY NO POINT, did I feel sad, frustrated, anxious, worried, or exhilarated during its belabored two hours and sixteen minutes. The characters felt like they could be potentially cloned from any PG-13 teen movie you've seen since Twilight hijacked the world and forced it's twisted, disgusting version of acceptable adolescent stereotypes upon us. You could almost swap out the light-sabers, tie-fighters, and storm troopers and you'd have a great sequel to whatever the hell number Hunger Games we're on these days (because that's how interesting the rest of the plot was).  Another thing that really annoyed me was the way in which the galaxy was too American. Of course I get it, it was made by Hollywood IT IS American, but guys, this is supposed to be in a GALAXY FAR AWAY, so why was there very little attempt made to try and hide that? Between the all too familiar mannerisms, jokes, and language I just couldn't fully suspend my disbelief. In my opinion, the originals managed to avoid most overt use of cultural indicators, I mean sure, it's impossible to avoid all due to obvious limitations, but watch the main character Finn carefully during the movie and you'll see that he's dripping with 21st century western American dude. Like literally drenched. Where was the otherworldly authenticity among the main characters?  Of course it wasn't all bad. The visuals were beautiful, much of the topography and effects were breathtaking, and I have to admit that I did feel pangs of nostalgia over any scene that included an X-wing, but overall it wasn't enough. Really a lot of what it comes down to is expectation. So many people have told me that they went into it not expecting too much and that they had "fun" watching it; and then there's me sitting here thinking: what on Tatooine are they talking about? With all the media hype this film received, not to mention the disappointment of the prequels, I was expecting a hell of a lot out of this movie, and simple fun ain't gonna cut it. Abrams seemed to have carved the profundity and soul out of Star Wars with a lightsaber‚Äî the same soul we've been waiting to enter our lives again ever since the prequels ruined them.  The Force Awakens was half way there, but it felt forced (pun intended), shallow, in need of a more refined plot, more mature characters, a deeper spirituality, moral complexity and depth; it needed to resonate more deeply with the IMPORTANT themes of the original, and to not have felt like a chaste teen romance with some old faces in there used like a box office tractor beam. If you're content with having your childhood favorite epic turned into a lovable, easily digestible icon of twenty-first century pop culture, marketed intentionally at young people to delight and entertain whilst simultaneously causing you to cringe at the fact that the original actors are okay with such a disservice to a beloved story, then you will enjoy the continuation of this franchise.  May the force save us from this trilogy.Boring and Predictable I jut got just back from the cinema, watching a movie everyone has been waiting for since 1983, me included. And i got to say, I'm starting to get a little bit tired of watching a 2 hour movie about destroying a death star. Because here we go again! George Lucas did not succeed with his follow-up movies, and there is many reasons for that. And no, it is mainly not because of Jar-Jar, it is because he just threw in one epic battle after the other, without having any good story, or any good plot, and at times horrible acting to come with it. Michael Bay has this as his trademark, but he is still very successful and his movies makes billions. And why is that?. Because kids. And the Star wars and transformers franchises have in common that they sell toys, in large quantity. This is what really makes the big bucks over time. Not the movies themselves. The movies are just big commercials for toys. George Lucas knew this better than anyone. And he is a brilliant businessman, but not so brilliant when it comes to making movies. I do like the first Star wars trilogy, with "the empire strikes back" as my favorite, this is by the way the film in the trilogy George Lucas himself dislikes the most. That pretty much explains why the second trilogy was so bad, as "The Empire Strikes back" spends more time developing a story than the other two films in the original trilogy, and therefor you get more attached to the characters. When George Lucas then made His second trilogy, all character development went out the window. This was a trilogy that was going to sell more toys, and that's it. Lucas has even half-way admitted this later on. And the fans of the Star wars franchise have disliked the second trilogy almost since release. I say almost, because many did hang in there for years, denying that the second trilogy was bad. But now most people seem to have noticed. So here we are in 2015 and J.J. Abrams takes over. He is the new skip, he gave us a fantastic reboot with Star Trek, now he is going to save us all from the god awful mistakes of George Lucas. We all believed it, we all hoped for it, at least he can not do worse than Lucas. The biggest hype of all time was born. And we fight a death star.... again.... Just a lot bigger.... Because of course bigger, at least they couldn't make it smaller..... What about not including a death star... Yet again? This movie tries so hard to show us a lot of cool stuff. But the pacing is awful, the slapstick humor is mostly misplaced, the introduction of the leading actors suffers from very bad timing. This movie basically tries to look and feel exactly like the original Star Wars film, but fails to bring us close to the leading characters. In the story, 30 years has gone by. A lot of things happen in that time, but the movie can't tell us anything about what has happened in those 30 years, all we get is guns blazing from the get go, till the very end. Almost no character development what so ever. Not even for Rey, the leading actress. Did J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan think it was enough to show us that when Rey eats less food than usual, was enough to make us really care for her? And just add in the "The family will never come back for you" sub plot? which BTW has no impact. Yes OK Rey is struggling a bit when we meet her, but she looks very healthy, she is climbing ropes and running like an Olympian in sand.. Ahh no, now i know. They showed us she had good morale by not selling the droid to get a lot more food.. Ahh.. So complicated. *sigh* This movie is so disappointing. This was their chance to make it right. To make Star Wars good again, not only focus on what 12 year old kids want to see constantly for 2 hours, which is laser beams and explosions. But it makes perfect sense, because these films are now all about making the big bucks, which is from selling toys. And now this film was released just before Christmas... No coincidence. So it's time to just take in some facts, the movies we grew up with, are never coming back. The only ones in the business that seem to get the movie story and toys business combo right, is Marvel. They had all this time. All this money. All this willpower. And this is what they come up with. Terrible script, bad story, outdated soundtrack, taking few or no risks to renew the franchise by telling the exact same story as before. What is really good about this film is the CGI and Sound effects. But that should not come as a surprise to anyone. The acting is mediocre. No one stands out and brings a really good performance. 4/10 - Very disappointing.It's like when an unknown Chinese manufacturer decided to make a fake iPhone So today I went to the premiere of the long awaited new star wars Episode 7.  Here is a fast and short opinion: The movie blows really blows.  Here is the more detailed opinion. The movie has no star wars feeling. None. No deep dialogs about the force and almost no background about what happened in the period between episode 6 and this one.  The dialogs between Ray and Finn sound like two modern age teenagers talking (first real dialogue between them, Finn asks Ray if she has a boyfriend). Horrible. Then there is the First Order (successors of The Empire) the bad guys. Their leader commander is the Sith wimp Kylo Ren who answers to a extremely bad CGI drawn Supreme leader (really?) about whom the audience doesn't get any information at all.  Kylo Ren is an insecure teenager with anger issues. His character destroys the sleek mysterious Sith presentation of the both prequel as the original trilogy. This is really a bad thing.  The main weapon of the First order is a death star on steroids. But the way the weapon works is taken straight out of Star Trek. This is a criminal offense.  Han Solo and Chewbacca appeared in the movie absolutely out of nowhere. It's like Abrams and Disney were desperate to throw them in there just for nostalgia.  Once again out of nowhere Ray figures out she has Jedi powers. The first time it happens is when Luke Skywalker's (who as been explained shortly decided abandon everyone and live in isolation in a place unknown) light-saber suddenly possesses the ability to show her where it's located in exactly the same way like bracelet of Anubis showed to Evelyn it's location in the movie Mummy returns. Also the audience figures out later on that non-Jedi's also can fight with light-sabers when Finn ( not a Jedi ) fight the wimpy Sith Kylo Ren. It's like who needs Jedi's, give a light-saber to a regular Joe and he will fight almost as good as a Jedi who had years of training.  There is one scene near the ending that is so incredibly bad it just makes you want to get up and leave the theater. It's a scene between Han Solo and Kylo Ren. Every person who has more than 2 brain cells will know what is going to happen. This scene is a direct spit in the face to the bad-ass Han Solo we all know and love. Conclusion:  Because Disney and Abrams decided not to include George Lucas in any way this movie has no Star wars feel and no soul. It's like when an unknown Chinese manufacturer decided to make a fake iPhone. They can call it an iPhone as much as they want, but it isn't an iPhone.The Manipulation Power of Nostalgia and Mass Appeal I want to start by stating I truly have enjoyed all Star Wars movies prior to this one. Even the prequels (which are obviously not as good) demolish this movie in plot, character building and EVEN action sequences. (there is only two lightsaber battles and they last seconds) Anyone with a brain and knowledge of the original trilogy can see that Star Wars: Episode VII was a regurgitation of the first three film's plot condensed into two hours. Everything was the same with slight twists down to the famous "Luke, I am your father" scene except it's with Han Solo and his apparent Sith son who stabs and throws off of the new Death Star. They added a bigger and badder Death Star, tossed Anakin's lightsaber around to whoever felt like using it to fight and did a terrible job of carrying on Star Wars essence. It was flooded with humor and half a**ed acting. There was no training or build up of power Rey is literally able to defeat the most powerful Sith Lord as a teenage girl who days before didn't even know she was a Jedi. Finn was able to wield and use a lightsaber although as far as I am concerned he is not a Jedi.  Han Solo and Chewbacca just happen to come across the Millennium Falcon after 30 years which just happens to have Luke Skywalker's daughter, Finn, and a droid carrying the map to Luke Skywalker on it. The film was pretty much downhill for me from this point on I spent most of my time watching this with a "What???" face and hands up in confusion as to how they could have made the film suck so bad. This film literally spanned out the introduction of old characters we know and love in order to keep our attention and keep us excited to see the next only to disappoint us with no further elaboration in story and literally no emotion. Leia hardly even reacted to losing the love of her life Han Solo. The dialogue between the two of them was rushed and obvious that they were trying to explain 30 years of story in small talk.  What I take as the mentality for this film: MAKE A BIGGER DEATHSTAR, OH BIGGER EMPEROR TOO (srsly what was up with that), GIRL JEDI MAIN CHARACTER, BLACK GUY WHO MIGHT BE A JEDI TOO MAIN CHARACTER (I am African American so don't take this as racism) people are going TO EAT THIS UP. And congratulations, you all did and now they will keep milking the franchise and making terribly thought out films with nothing more than CGI and humor to make up for it.  Throughout this film I found myself wanting to walk out of the theater and just be done but I couldn't resist waiting for the punchline of this joke of a film and boy did I get it. After all of the humor riddled torture we are brought to the final scene. Rey is going to see her long lost dad who I guess spent all of this time standing on a random mountain looking at the beach. And then it happens, what we had all been waiting for. Luke turns around and sees the daughter he was forced to abandon and she hold out Anakin's lightsaber as some odd tribute to him (I don't see the symbolism in this) at this point I just burst out laughing at how bad this journey has been and that's it it's over. The next thing I see is JJ Abrams. I proceeded to scream "BOO" at the screen multiple times with the only response to it being "cmon it wasn't that bad" after that I walked outside and contemplated throwing up as the movie was so bad it caused me to feel nauseous.  This film took advantage of Star Wars fans and played into a hand of re-doing famous scenes with different characters and telling the same story over again. It's sad that people actually think this movie was good or acceptable because now they are going to once again shame the Star Wars name. BOYCOTT EPISODE 8. THIS RENDITION NEEDS TO BE SCRAPPED AND REBOOTED THEY ARE JUST MILKING THIS FRANCHISE.Was this supposed to be a SEQUEL....or REBOOT? Failed miserably at both.... A small droid carrying classified data crash lands on desert planet. Meets teenage characters. Rebel Alliance needs the data to fight the Empire's new planet-destroying weapon. Rinse and repeat. Sound familiar? That was the plot to both Episode IV: A New Hope, and Jar-Jar Abrams latest calamity that just found its way onto cinema screens across the country. I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to like this movie-- but alas, we got yet another one of Abrams' typical mind-numbing explosion-fests. It has ALL of Jar-Jar Abrams normal movie failings: * A cast of characters almost entirely made up of pre-adolescents trying to play adult roles. * Dialogue/screenplay that seems like it was written by an 8-year old. * Nothing that even slightly resembles a plot. I am surprised Abrams didn't put "Red Matter" in this movie to fill in all the gaps between his weak story-telling and the plot loopholes it creates, like he did with Star Disaster XI. As is the case with most of the reboots he has done to date-- Abrams lacks the creativity and writing ability to come up with an original and compelling plot on his own, so he just plagiarizes an existing story and makes "some changes" to better fit his "vision" (as in LSD-induced) of it. He props up these mindless stories by inserting a bunch of unnecessary homage moments to famous lines and clich√©s from the previous established films in the mythos to try and give his creation validity ("He's dead, Jim"). Really? Another movie about destroying a death star? A droid carrying the plans that the Empire wants to stop from falling into Alliance hands? How original.... He doesn't care if his stories makes sense or not, or if he breaks his own rules; in Star Trek XI, like when the Enterprise could not beam up Spock's mother (because she was falling), but later in the movie, Scotty and Kirk beamed onto the Enterprise from another solar system while it was moving at warp speed with no problems! The Force Awakens had PLENTY of these "Abrams' moments". A wise man once told me-- "The litmus test for good and bad storytelling comes down to this: do the actions of the characters in your story fit the background and motivations you gave them in your story history? If not-- it is GARBAGE." For instance, a Romulan captain, so enraged his home planet got destroyed-- would not sit on his hands for 25 years, waiting for Spock (who, given the complexity of time travel-- might NEVER have appeared) to show up, so he can blow up the entire galaxy (obviously Abrams does not understand interstellar distances) just to show everyone just how mad he really is!! Now there is a story that will be remembered over the ages.... The actors in this movie were so poor-- it was difficult to tell what exactly their motivations, passions, and driving ideals were. They all had about as much emotional content as Hayden Christiansen (little or none) from the prequels. * Explosions and guns ablazing, pretty much from the moment the beginning credits close until the end credits start rolling. By the time you are 5 minutes into the movie-- you are already bored and desensitized to it. I am not surprised to find that many of the people who thought Star Trek XI and XII (the one with a Caucasian Khanoonian Singh) were good movies, also think this movie was in any way memorable (other than the humongous sense of disappointment I walked out of the theater feeling). Jar-Jar Abrams should be banned from ruining any more legendary movie franchises. The fans themselves could have written a better story and backdrop for this film.Blockbuster: Unimaginative, cheap, no fantasy, lacked vision I loved all the previous star wars movies (yes, even the prequels).  But this, this was just deeply disappointing. I could get past all the cheap/easy typical Disney humour (which is actually enjoyable in cartoons) but the plot of the movie, lack of character development, and lack of star wars was just too much. The only thing making this movie resemble star wars were the old stars from the original movie. it was pleasant to see Han Solo, but only as a fan of the original film. Within itself, the whole Leia-Han Solo love story was completely destroyed by this movie. Their relationship seemed superficial. but it didn't really matter because there was just no time for character development or illustration of the depth of their relationship. The movie just needed to show more dull fight scenes, entirely recycled across the original trilogy.  The meaning and depth of the force was cheapened: apparently now a storm trooper can not just use a light saber but also fight and win with a Sith Lord (who at the beginning of the film was able to stop bullets mid air, kill with the force, and read people's minds).  The force doesn't awaken because we never see the force being forgotten. Instead the new characters at one recognize Han Solo and know everything there is to know about Skywalker: boring much?! Reminds me of a bad episode IV.  The plot of the film is essentially going to destroy the death star.... yes the death star... BUT NO WAIT IT'S 10X BIGGER IT'S FINE.  All in all, even writing the review is painful. I was expecting a beautifully executed movie, given the advancement of technology and funding for this. Instead I saw something so simple, I wanted to leave (during the premiere). Clearly, long gone are the days of incredible creatures, amazing costumes (shout out to Lucas). And in are the days of a cheap villain, who looks like he came straight out of a Disney princess movie: and acts the same....  Please, please, please improve the next movie. DO A PLOT. We can think for ourselves, I promise....Disappointment all around I was really looking forward to this movie even knowing that Abrams will be directing it. And now I wish I didn't watch. It was just bad. No other words for it. Everyone already said about plot being just a random rehash of previous episodes. We've already seen all situations, all locations, all plot turns. There's nothing original in this movie and it seems pointless in general.  SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Some basics of the SW Universe are changed to accommodate the characters. Now a guy who is not a Force-user can fight with a trained Sith using a lightsaber. Untrained Force-user can use jedi mindtricks with no training at all. Sith can feel a non-Force-user from across considerable distance but not if the same man is standing 10 meters apart from him. Stormtroopers see Sith have a fit if pointless hysterics and calmly walk away from him despite his summons. Light Side is a constant seduction to Siths. And so on and so on... It all feels like a badly written fanfic. END SPOILERS And it is also filmed badly. In all Star Wars movies first appearance of ship or a planet always was a momentous scene. This is totally lost here. Also there are many unflattering camera angles, poorly choreographed scenes, battle sequences are rushed and not always thought-out. With modern technology and special effects it could have been magnificent, but instead it's cheaply looking. I've caught myself thinking that "A New Hope" looked better and more advanced than this one. Maybe if you've never watched Star Wars you will like this movie, but for those familiar with old episodes it most probably will be a major let down. 1 out of 10 just because it' impossible to give 0.Not the Movie I Paid to See CRITIQUE  1. If you want to know what this movie is about, then simply watch Star Wars Episode IV (A New Hope), because the story is nearly verbatim with elements thrown in from episodes V and VI for good measure. 2. The leads who take the rein from the old Star Wars Universe are: Hispanic, black, and a woman. There is nothing wrong with this in and of itself, but when it is done simply to be politically correct, then the story suffers. I think one critic describes this best when she said, "For the first time in Star Wars history, a franchise will be built around the adventures of the sort of people that Hollywood routinely overlooks: women and people of color. So even if The Force Awakens sucks, it's made one big diverse achievement for Hollywood." This means the only place you will see an honest review of this movie is in the user reviews here at IMDb 3. Luke is now Obi Wan, his long lost daughter is the new hope, and his nephew is the new Darth Vader 4. They broke nearly every rule established by the original Star Wars. Jedi talent no longer takes years of training, nor does one need to be strong with the force to hold his own in a light saber battle against a trained Sith lord, etc. WHAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE There are 100 places they could have taken this story. They could have made Jar Jar a secret Sith lord who was playing dumb all these years, they could have worked in elements of Star Wars Rebels and made Ezra a Sith lord, or they could have had it where Luke turned to the dark side. I even heard early rumors that they were going to have Finn find Luke's severed hand with a light saber in it. To me, it would have made the most sense to do a story where the Republic is now the political force of the Galaxy and the First Order are the rebels. Luke could have been training a new Jedi order and they could have shown a growing Sith threat, with a real villain and not the weanie in panties that we got in this movie, throughout the battles with the First Order. They could have made Hans more distinguished (after all he was a King and it's been 30 years, so he should have grown up by now). Instead, we got the same Han Solo from 1975 but who looked 40 years older and disheveled. I'm sure Harrison Ford had no intention of doing another Star Wars movie and insisted that this would be the last one. So he would have been killed off no matter what. However, it could have been far less predictable and more creative and touching. If they wanted to keep the story line they went with, then they still could have started this way and shown how Kylo Rey was turning to the dark side. Any of these would have been far better than the trash I saw tonight. It's amazing how I could think of these story lines (as I'm sure can 1000s of other Star Wars fans) but none of the so called talented writers, producers, and directors in Hollywood can do this? This simply amounts to lazy writing and oversight. CONCLUSION Because everything was so predictable and the story was a rehash of what we already saw, the movie was BORING! It's amazing how Hollywood can continue to put out movies like this, cheat their viewers, and then wonder in astonishment why everyone stays home to stream or pirate movies. Maybe it's because more and more movies these days simply support overpaid political activists whose only creative effort is to make a political statement at the expense of entertainment. I'm done with Star Wars. I don't need to see episodes VIII or IX, because I already know what is going to happen. Episode VIII and IX will be remakes of the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi with Ren as Luke, Luke as Obi Wan, and Kylo Rey as Darth Vader. I'm sure VIII will have the surprise statement by Kylo Rey when he battles Ren saying, "Ren, I am your cousin," and IX will end with Ren bringing Rey to the good side with little furry creatures celebrating in tree tops and the ghosts of Luke and Han looking approvingly over the scene. Yeah, been there done that, there is no sense in my wasting money or time to do it again. Star Wars is Dead! Thanks Disney and Abrams and you politically correct whackos. Thanks a lot! A NOTE ON POSITIVE REVIEWS After reading many of the positive reviews, I can only come to the conclusion that 1/3 of them are written by hard core Star Wars fans who will rave about anything with the "Star Wars" logo attached to it and will refuse to their dying day that they were wrong about this movie, 1/3 by people who never saw Star Wars and accept this cheap rip off because it is the only version of the story they have seen, and 1/3 by studio hacks. The positive reviewers have also resorted to calling the negative reviewers "Haters." It's amazing how convenient it is today for people to throw that word around to discredit anyone who has a differing opinion. That should tell you everything you need to know about the character and honesty of the positives reviewers.The new "New hope" dies at the hands of the Disney money-making machine There may be some spoilers, even though I have done my best to avoid them!  I am a big fan of the OT, and like many fans was disappointed by the silly prequels. I felt excited for this new trilogy, and hoped JJ Abrams was going to be able to give us new stories to propel the series forward. After the prequels, at least there was the hope of someone new coming in and renewing the sense of magic and wonder that have been the very soul of the OT. Now this hope has been extinguished. Disney has put so much effort into safely making money (a lot of it, too), from the cash cow that is Star Wars, that they have stifled any creativity that could have made this movie great.  For more detail read below : I saw the movie last night, and here are its best and worst moments. What worked:  1. Imagery - hands down, awesome visuals, but that is to be expected given how much this movie must have cost to make.  2. The new droid, BB8 is cute  3. There was no Jar Jar Binks :)  4. Some humor, still falling a bit flat of the original  5. The reunion of Han Solo and Chewbacca, those two were as great as ever What did not work (for me) 1. The weak story - practically a rehash or the "A New Hope" plot, but without the freshness and creativity that made the original work so well. Throughout the whole movie I had the feeling of "been there, done that", and ended up being bored. I mean, we are destroying the Death Star for a third time now, really? Ooooh, but this time it is bigger. And we are again hiding a secret information in a droid?. Snooze.  2.The main characters. What worked so well in the OT was they had introduced very charismatic characters and they also took the time to develop them and give us reasons to care for them. The creation of bonds of friendship and camaraderie between Han, Luke and Leia happened organically, made sense and was justified. The three new leads try to display the same, but it feels forced as nothing in the story should have lead them to feel that way about each other. I could not bring myself to are about Poe, or Rey or Finn, so not sure how they will carry the franchise forward  3. Weak villains who do not project enough danger for the Resistance. I admit, it must be hard to equal, let alone top, such awesome villains as Lord Vader or the Emperor. Still, the new villains, Supreme Commander Snoke, Kylo Ren and Hux come across as average wanna-bees and do not provide the necessary feel of dread, to make us feel threatened.  4. Weak script. I had high hopes after I learned Lawrence Kasdan was writing the script, but my hopes were unfounded. In the OT each main character was given a very compelling reason why they were involved with the rebels. For Leia, it was because of her father, Luke saw his family killed, and Han, after his initial resistance, had fallen for Leia and had come back to rescue Luke during the raid against the Death Star. In this new movie, there was no compelling reason for Finn, and ex-storm trooper, to somehow overcome being brainwashed and conditioned to kill and develop high moral principles and sense of humor. For Rey, there was no compelling reason to rescue BB8 in the desert. Poe was already with the resistance, but feeling all buddy-buddy with Finn happened all of a sudden, more because of "well the main characters are supposed to be like that" rather than any sense-making reason  5. No character development. I cannot believe that they had such golden opportunity to introduce the new leads who should have been these new interesting characters, and they did nothing to develop them and make us feel any sense of camaraderie with them! I mean, Finn, trying to overcome his storm trooper conditioning; Rey going from a desert scavenger to something more; Kylo Ren's insecurities, his volatility and his rivalry with Hux - all of these could have been used to give us some memorable moments, and instead were wasted.  6. Things happening too quickly and in a forced way. Remember how Luke had to train to access the Force and gain any control over it? Remember Ben Kenoby, a seasoned Jedi, using Jedi mind tricks? Well the new Jedi uses these things without any training at all, it all just happens out of nowhere  7. Musical score. The Star Wars theme is easily one of the most epic, amazing movie scores ever written. If I had not wanted to be a Jedi so bad, just the Imperial march alone would have made me join the Dark Side :))) So I was hoping we were going to get some more musical awesomeness, after all, it did happen for the sucky prequels, right? Not so here. To my disappointment, there was no awesome First Order theme, no nothing. It pains me so much to say that, because in my mind John Williams is and will remain the greatest movie composer everOne of the worst You can no longer trust IMDB ratings. They are bought and paid for by the studios. Movie after movie is rated 8 and above and are complete disasters. This movie is like a remake by a 10 year old. Just disgusting.HORRIBLE I loved the original Star Wars movies but this was WRETCHED! The storyline was as slow and shaky as 75yr old Harrison Ford trying to run around like an action hero. PAINFUL to watch. Equally painful to see John Boyega try to act. Boyega and Ridley were TERRIBLE in their attempts at fight scenes that went on forever without a purpose or expertise.one word sums it up, plagiarism It's like they just took the story of Episode IV, tweaked it in places, moved a couple of bits around and stuck in bits from the rest of the Original and Prequel series, then thought 'they'll never know' Well, we did. Let's start from the beginning. Rey is abandoned on a desert planet as a slave and grows up making a living as a junk dealer. Luke was left with his aunt and uncle on a desert planet (not the same planet but very similar) and made to do similarly menial work and deal with junk dealing Jawa's. And the slave thing is just a throw-back to Anakin Skywalker in Episode I. Then an old man on the same planet gives the Resistance pilot (Poe) a segment of a map to Luke Skywalker; thanks to him the First Order appear on the planet and through some space battles a First Order defector (Finn) encounters Rey who helps her to escape the planet aboard the Millennium Falcon. Here they also meet Han Solo and Chewbacca. Firstly 'Resistance' is a title given to those who fight AGAINST the people in power, yet they fight FOR the people in power. Secondly the name 'First Order' is stupid and makes no sense. The old man, Poe and Finn are basically the equivalent of Obi-Wan in this story, as each fulfil roles Obi-Wan had played with Luke. Han, Rey and co then travel to find a weird alien creature in a bar of aliens whereupon the First Order attacks and the Resistance save them. I'm reminded of the cantina scene on Tatooine (only without the music) in Episode IV. Rey however is captured by the First Order (led by Kylo Ren) and is taken to the First Orders super weapon. Meanwhile the First Order use their super weapon to destroy the New Republic's governing worlds and Kylo talks about Rey with his master Snoke. While imprisoned Rey discovers her connection to the Force and begins experimenting with her abilities. Just as Luke started discovering his connection to the Force and began training with Obi-Wan, the only difference being that Rey has no one to help her. Then you get the Jedi Mind Trick on the Storm Trooper, how many times was THAT used in Episode IV? Then there's the First Orders super weapon; it's basically a Death Star built inside a planet, but for what purpose? And the test firing, all I can say is Alderaan. Then there's the bad guy 'Kylo Ren' - a boy trained as a Jedi who turned to the dark side and wears a black suit with a mask that changes his voice (too many similarities to Darth Vader to be comfortable, and they really rub it in when he 'prays' to Vader's mangled helmet. At least Darth Vader's mask had a point to it) And his master Snoke, a weird man with a messed up face who appears as a giant hologram - just as Darth Sideous appeared to Darth Vader in Episode IV. Han, Chewbacca and Finn launch a rescue mission to save Rey while the Resistance plan to destroy the super weapon. Han, Chewbacca and Finn infiltrate the super weapon and, while searching for Rey, they encounter Captain Phasma and use her to access the computer and dump her down a garbage chute. Basically Captain Phasma here plays the role of R2-D2 when he accessed the Death Star computer to find Princess Leia in Episode IV, then the garbage chute is just an unnecessary throw-back to the same film. What's the point of Captain Phasma anyway? A Storm Trooper in a full silver suit whose only role is walking around and talking? Han and Chewbcca then lay charges to destroy the shield generator for the Resistance to attack the super weapon. Where did they get that idea I wonder, oh wait that's how they destroyed the second Death Star in Episode VI. As they finish planting the bombs Han faces Kylo and reveals he is his father, then Kylo kills him. It's Episode V in reverse. And Han's death isn't that much of a shock when you think about it, they killed off Obi-Wan in Episode IV, and they couldn't kill off one of the new characters. Just a side note on these new characters, why do they all have one syllable names? Poe, Finn, Rey. Yes there's Kylo Ren, but his real name is Ben. Chewbacca then detonates the bombs and they all escape. Rey then fights Kylo in the forest, however the fight is ended suddenly with no victor when they are separated by an earthquake. It's basically a rehash of Episode V when Luke fights Darth Vader on cloud city and drops through a filter to escape, except here no one loses a hand. The Resistance then attack the generator by flying inside and destroying vital components before escaping. It's the second Death Star repeated almost exactly, except the Millennium Falcon wasn't the ship flying inside. Everyone then escapes the super weapon before it explodes and meets back at the Resistances base. R2-D2 then 'awakens' and with the map segment from the start of the film he reveals the rest of the map from his memory that shows Luke's exact route across the galaxy. The film implies that the map R2-D2 had was from the original Death Star in Episode IV, 36 years earlier, so how does it have Luke's route already plotted on it? A segment of R2-D2's map however is missing (which is the segment from earlier) how did this get lost, and how did the old man have it? Rey then uses the completed map to find Luke Skywalker to begin her full training as a Jedi. Just as Luke went to find Yoda in Episode V, and the map from R2-D2 was essentially the same as ghost Obi-Wan telling Luke to go to Dagobah. This film should be renamed 'The Farce Awakens' The actual title makes no sense anyway, The Force Awakens, was it asleep? After this mass-plagiarism I don't hold out much hope for Episode VIII, not even A New Hope, and definitely wouldn't waste my money on it at the cinema as I had done with this waste of time.A slightly more adult Star Wars that shows Lucas was right to let go of the series. I have never been a huge fan of the Star Wars films--especially after the last three films they made. Too often, in my opinion, the emphasis was merchandising cute characters to kids instead of making the best possible sci-fi film. Fortunately, now that George Lucas sold off the franchise, Disney actually has made a slightly darker and slightly more adult addition to the franchise...and I was thoroughly impressed. I really DON'T want to talk about the plot of "The Force Awakens"-- mostly because the movie just debuted and I would prefer folks experience it themselves. However, I don't think it spoils it in any way to say that the film is a bit of the old and a bit of the new. So, folks who loved the earlier films (particularly the great ones) will be happy that the film is clearly Star Wars and has a lot of similar plot elements from the earlier movies. You also get to see some familiar faces. But there also are several new ones and they seem to have a bit more depth than usual. I particularly liked Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley)--they were not just formulaic characters and you really like and respect them. The bottom line is that the film very much kept my interest and Disney seemed much more focused on story and, especially, characterization. A thoroughly enjoyable film from start to finish.Brilliant Special Effects and Nice Mix of the Old and New Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)  *** (out of 4)  I'm pretty sure every person on Earth know what the film is about and just in case you don't I'm not going to spoil anything here in regards to the plot. Yes, it's basically a reworking of A NEW HOPE with the old and new characters being brought together to go up against the Dark Side. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS was probably the most anticipated movie in recent memory and as no shocked it turned out to be a massive hit. I predicted when I heard that it was going to be made that it would eventually become the top grossing movie ever made. It hasn't quite reached that mark as of me writing this but I'm sure it will happen. So, we know it was a massive hit but how was the actual movie?  I'm not a major STAR WARS fan but this one here isn't nearly as good as episodes four through six. How could it be? With that said I must admit that I found the film to be extremely entertaining, which is all I was personally asking for. I thought J.J. Abrams did a very good job at building up the new characters and the new story while also keeping the original trilogy fans happy. I thought the screenplay was clever in how the old characters were brought into this new story and I won't complain about any of the events that happen in regards to the story. The special effects, as you'd expect, are spectacular and they certainly push the level in regards to what can be done today. The various space battles were tremendous to look at and best of all is that they feel 100% authentic and real. There wasn't a single battle where you didn't feel as if you were right there in the action and this is always a major plus. Another thing are that the robotic characters are all well-designed and manage to fit right in with the series. The film is full of wonderful action scenes and all of them are full of terrific atmosphere. Performance wise, against I'm not going to spoil anything major so all I will say is that the original three actors are all excellent in how they are used. The new people like Daisy Ridley, JOhn Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver all are good and I think fans have a nice cast to take this series into the future. Of course, we also have Chewbacca back, which is always fun. The film does have some flaws and I think some of it is based around the humor. The film goes for a lot of humor and I thought a lot of it didn't work all that well. Ford and Chewbacca get some nice moments together but many times the jokes fell flat. I'd also say that the film ran on a tad bit too long but the ending was so wonderful that it was fun once it came. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is really just a set-up for what's to follow and it certainly has me excited for what comes next.The force has awakened! Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'. Despite seeing 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' around the time it first came out (maybe a little after), there was a long time of being put off by the vitriolic hate it's gotten here and the practical war zone there is in order to review it (even when it was critically acclaimed). Finally mustering the courage, count me in as somebody who loved 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens'. A masterpiece? No. Better than the prequels? Absolutely, and although some may disagree this is saying a lot. The best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi?' Yes. 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is not the most original plot-wise. It has been criticised for being a re-hash of 'A New Hope', understandably. However, instead of being done in a cheap and slap-in-the-face way, it felt like an affectionate and nostalgic homage. Exemplified by bringing back major characters from the original trilogy in supporting roles. JJ Abrams, and this may be considered blasphemy, does a much better job here than he did with his 'Star Trek' reboot films, here he keeps the original spirit of the original trilogy intact while giving the film its own identity at the same time. While it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic at the expense of creating memorable characters, a fun story and brains and heart. The characters are memorable with easily identifiable leads, the original trilogy characters bringing a lot of affectionate nostalgia and a well executed if not iconic (not by Darth Vader standards anyhow) villain in Kylo Ren (unpredictable and dangerous but feeling he is morally justified). The story lacks originality but more than makes up for it in energy, non-stop heart-thumping thrills and excitement, generosity, a cheerfulness that is positively space operatic, vibrant charm and a few fresh twists along the way. In many ways it is a celebration of the universe while also an expansion of it. It is sometimes sentimental but never overly so, one crucial death scene is just heart-wrenching (particularly Chewbacca's reaction) and doesn't feel like a slap in the face to the character in question. Could the villains have been better written? Ren is fine but Snoke only just about works as a character thanks to the visual effects and especially the powerfully enigmatic with a touch of vulnerability performance of Andy Serkis, other than that the character is underwritten. Also felt that Gwendoline Christie's character was unnecessary, so limited was her screen time. Visually, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed with Abrams' visual storytelling shining far more here than it has in other films he's done. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films. Thank goodness that the dialogue contains little to none of the cheesiness heard in the prequels, and it even has more layers than that of the original trilogy. Acting also shines, with winning charismatic performances from John Boyega and particularly Daisy Ridley. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher still have it, while Max Von Sydow shows himself to be a master of gestures and eye contact speaking louder than words. Adam Driver is a suitably menacing Ren and Serkis makes much of his somewhat underwritten character. Oscar Isaac gives a typically strong performance. In conclusion, a great film, the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and one of the best of the saga too. 9/10 Bethany CoxWhere to begin?! Unlike many moviegoers, I couldn't care less about the STAR WARS franchise these days. Sure, I grew up with the original trilogy, which I still know and love, but George Lucas single-handedly destroyed the goodwill surrounding those movies with his mishandling of the prequels. The good news is that THE FORCE AWAKENS - a genuine sequel to RETURN OF THE JEDI - is better than the prequels, but only just. Because this is a deeply flawed movie that gets ten things wrong for everything it gets right. While it's a delight to see Harrison Ford effortlessly breezing back into one of his most iconic roles, the rest of the production is a mixed bag of good and bad, of the woeful and the wonderful. Inevitably, the special effects are one of the strongest things here. The copious use of the CGI looks better than ever, and the alien planets involved in the story are all well realised. You can't fault the large-scale action sequences, which look great in high definition, and as a whole the film is a visual treat. A shame, then, that the story is so weak and a virtual retread of the first STAR WARS film, A NEW HOPE, made all those years ago. The new villains are laughable and Adam Driver's attempts at an iconic baddie along the lines of Darth Vader are quite pitiful. The starkiller stuff is as predictable as it gets, and you wonder why they couldn't go in a fresh and new direction instead of simply regurgitating what has come previously. The new characters don't fare very well either. John Boyega, who was so good in ATTACK THE BLOCK, struggles with a put-on American accent that rings hollow. Daisy Ridley is even worse: this newcomer seems to have overdosed on Keira Knightley performances, copying Knightley's style of acting throughout and feeling completely artificial as a result. All of her lines sound cheesy and wooden, and frankly I felt embarrassed watching her attempting to act alongside the more seasoned actors. It says something that the droid, BB-8, was my favourite of the new characters, given that his high 'cuteness' factor is a shamelessly manipulative attempt to endear him to audiences. Add in a non-ending of a film that merely opens the door for the next inevitable instalment, and you have an oddly hollow film that looks nice but falls apart as soon as you start picking at it.The Return of Star Wars It's over 30 years since the defeat of the empire. The Republic is threatened by the First Order led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) under the control of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). The resistance led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is fighting the Dark Side. Finn (John Boyega) is a conflicted stormtrooper. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger on the planet Jakku. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is the Resistance ace pilot. It has been over 30 years since the last truly good Star Wars movie. It is a great reboot and a solid repair job to the damage from the prequels. The biggest complaint seems to be that this is a repeat of A New Hope. If anything, this is pulling out scenes and references from all three originals. I have no problems with that. In fact, it's good to go back and take pages out of the original trilogy. Even the force is explained more in the traditional way. However, this is not a simple repeat. The new characters are tremendous. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are amazing additions. He's an interesting character and I love their initial meeting. I love him keep grabbing her hand. There are some minor problems but they're too minor to mention especially considering the spoilers. I rank 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980) the best, 'A New Hope' (1977) second, and I may squeeze 'The Force Awakens' slightly ahead of 'Return of the Jedi' (1983). Forget the prequels. P.S. In this one, nobody loses a lightsaber fight because of elevation.Overcomes its inherent challenges by producing a fast paced, dramatic, fun, and very enjoyable film that hits all its marks By all accounts, this film really shouldn't work as well as it does. Looking at it in the cold light of day it is essentially a repeat of the original film in terms of narrative ‚Äì albeit with some details changed and all the characters moved sideways by a generation. So we have the same parent/child divide, the same innocent discovering their power, right down to the same finale with a large planet-sized weapon. Associated with this it also rides very heavily on nostalgia and brand recognition so that we probably accept a lot of plotting conveniences that we would scoff at in a film we came into cold. However, even seeing all these things, it is hard not to love it for how well it works. It does this by getting the balanced right between all the many aspects that the film seeks to pull together. So we have the nostalgia and a very familiar narrative, but at the same time we have a story that is delivered in a way that engages and is surprisingly moving at times (albeit due to that self-same nostalgia and reliance on us already being invested in this universe and the characters). It also manages to be fun but yet also able to transition into darker moments without one damaging our enjoyment of the other. This is what makes it work I think ‚Äì because it is really an enjoyable film to watch. It never really stops moving, and the characters are rather thin, but within this frame they work and are engaging. The cast are a big part of that, and it is a very well-cast piece given that the new faces are not dominated by the old familiar ones. Boyega makes good on that charisma he showed when playing the lead in Attach the Block, while Ridley is really natural and likable. For all the fuss over a black storm trooper and a female 'Luke', the truth is that both do a great job regardless of race/color ‚Äì but do bring that extra factor into play (I had a daughter recently, and it did rather focus my mind on the deficient of strong female characters who are played for themselves, not for their sexuality). The cast is deep in familiar faces and really everyone is on good form ‚Äì Fisher perhaps seems there because she has to be, but it was nice to see Ford manage to have a bit of a twinkle back in his eyes. The volume of familiar faces in tiny roles does get a bit distracting (particularly if you have watched any shows from Abrams and know his usual cast) but this is a minor thing since the film otherwise does a very good job of keeping you with it for all its adventure and fun. Such a hyped film with such weight on its shoulders really shouldn't be able to be so light on its feet while also delivering dramatic and emotional moments, but it does. A really enjoyable Star Wars film that delivers a lot ‚Äì and regardless what George Lucas thinks, it has been a very long time since that was the case.On par with the old films Now the title of this review is probably the ultimate compliment when it comes to huge Star wars fans out there. Unfortunately I am not one of them. I liked the old films and I liked this new movie here just as much, without considering either to be groundbreaking or some other superlative. This new movie runs for 2 hours and 15 minutes and was written and directed by J.J. Abrams, who is mostly known for "Lost" and "Star Trek". It is the ultimate breakthrough movie for John Boyega, but even more so Daisy Ridley. And while I liked the latter, I thought that it was so nice to see Oscar Isaac as usual. Cool reunion also from "Inside Llewyn Davis" with Adam Driver here, even if the two had no scenes together. Fans of the old "Star Wars" film will appreciate the inclusion of Harrison Ford, who has lots of screen time, Carrie Fisher, who has solid screen time, and Mark Hamill, who has almost no screen time, but it is indicated that he will make a much bigger impact in the next film. This new "Star Wars" film managed no less than five Academy Award nominations, all in the technical categories and this also describes the film perfectly. Yes there are some interesting plot developments and characters, but it's really all about the technical side. Music, effects, editing etc. are all really good. The acting is mostly fine, but nothing to rave about. This does also include Harrison Ford, who has a truly baity supporting role here and I am a bit shocked he got no awards attention for his turn here. He and Driver also share the most dramatic and emotionally crucial scene of the film during their interaction on a bridge. Oh yeah and let us not forget about the light saber action scenes. These are truly cool to watch, no denying. There are a couple more famous names included here and the one I want to mention as well is Domhnall Gleeson, who is having an amazing year with all the films he is in. Finally, I also liked the little robot and Chewbacca of course, who bring some solid comic relief, certainly more than most of the "human" characters' one-liners that weren't as funny as they were intended to be. All in all, this film was pretty much what I expected. Great action and impressive visually (check it out on the big screen), but not really convincing in terms of story and character development. The financial success does not come surprising at all though. The brand is obviously as much in demand as always. I believe it was a good watch and if you like science fiction more than I do, you will probably have an even better watch and appreciate this film even more than I did. This does not say, of course, that I did not like it. On the contrary, I had a pretty good times and it's certainly an achievement for a film with that runtime that I almost never felt it dragged. Thumbs up and nice cliffhanger ending too. I will certainly watch the next one as well.Give the Sensation of D√©j√† Vu Thirty years after the fall of the Galactic Empire, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is vanished and there is a new threat to the Republic: The First Order under the command of the Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). General Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the Resistance has sent her best pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) to the planet Jakku to get a map with the location of her brother. However, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the Stormtroopers destroy the village and Poe hides the map in his droid BB- 8 before he is captured. Ren wants to kill the last Jedi and needs to know his whereabouts. But the Stormtrooper FN-2187 (John Boyega) saves Poe and flees with him in a TIE fighter. Poe calls him Finn, but they crash on Jakku and Finn survives while Poe disappears. Meanwhile the scavenger teenager Rey (Daisy Ridley) finds BB-8 and brings him to the trade camp. But Ren discovered that BB-8 has the map and attacks Jakku. However Rey, Finn and BB-8 steal the Millennium Falcon that is left in a junkyard and escape from Jakku. When the spacecraft breaks down in space, they meet Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca. They have an incident with gangs but they succeed to go to the Resistance base, but Rey is captured by Ren. But the Resistance learns that the huge Starkiller Base is powering a weapon to destroy their planet and now their only chance to destroy the weapon depends on Han Solo, Chewbacca and Finn that wants to save Rey.  All the fans had great expectations with "Star Wars: The Force Awakens", but the film has an unoriginal story. The franchise is orphan of George Lucas and the new writers were not able to create anything new. The Death Star is replaced by the Starkiller Base. Darth Vader, the father of Luke Skywalker, is replaced by Kylo Ren, the son of Han Solo and Leia. R2-D2 is replaced by BB-8. Senator Palpatine, or Darth Sidious, is replaced by the Supreme Leader Snoke. The destruction of the weapon depends of the explosion of the power generator. There are so many similarities in the story of "The Force Awakens" with the other episodes that gives the sensation of d√©j√† vu. In addition, the characters are poorly developed. All good things should come to an end, but greed is the root of all evil. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Star Wars: O Despertar da For√ßa" ("Star Wars: The Awekening of the Force")An Impressive Blockbuster Film...That Said I saw Quentin Tarentino on Stephen Colbert the other night. He pointed out that no matter what movie he's gone to, he always remembers that it is still a movie...that he never falls into the spell to where he forgets. People say they do. He doesn't. I deliberately stayed away from any reviews or comments on this film. But I couldn't avoid all of the hype and that hype, by its very nature, made me constantly aware I was watching a movie that was going to make huge sums of money. I'm having trouble separating myself from that sense of "why did they do this?" And "why did they choose her." And, "Isn't Harrison Ford a stitch." Not Han Solo but Harrison Ford. Anyway, I have to admit that I sort of enjoyed it. It has lots of action, some interesting characters, a nostalgic feel, and so on. And a force is a force of course, of course. I skipped work so I could be at the first screening of the first "Star Wars" film back in 1977. I have to admit that as a reader of much challenging science fiction, I found the whole thing pretty bland. But it is a cultural entity, it bears watching. I don't know that there was much new here that would make one want badly to come back for more. When I saw the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, I marked my calendar, hoping I would live to see all three episodes. And in that one, I already knew the plot. I'll be interested to see how this holds up to the test of time. For me the second set of the films are quite forgettable. And, again, for me, only one of the original caught my interest.Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens Disney paid over $4 billion to buy Lucasfilm, George Lucas himself served as creative consultant, I was super excited about a new movie, and the original stars returning, it was just a question of whether the acquisition was worth it, forget the prequels (no Jar Jar Binks), directed by J.J. Abrams (Lost, Mission: Impossible III, Star Trek, Super 8). Basically it's been 30 years since the destruction of the second Death Star, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last Jedi, has disappeared, the remains of the fallen Galactic Empire have risen and become The First Order, seeking to eliminate Skywalker and the Republic, the Resistance, backed by the Republic, are led by Luke's sister, Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), opposing the First Order and searching for Luke. On the planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) obtains a map to Luke's location from village elder Lor San Tekka (Max von Sydow), Stormtroopers, commanded by Kylo Ren (What If's Adam Driver), destroy the village and capture Poe, his droid BB-8 escapes with the map, and comes across scavenger Rey (introducing Daisy Ridley) at a junkyard settlement. The First Order Stormtrooper FN-2187 (Attack the Block's John Boyega) is unable to kill, gets away, frees Poe and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter, Poe gives him the new name "Finn". Poe and Finn crash on Jakku, Finn appears to be the only survivor, he finds Rey and BB-8 in the village, the First Order find them and attack, the three flee the planet in the stolen, rundown Millennium Falcon. Following a chase and escape, the Falcon breaks down and is captured by a larger ship, piloted by Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew and Joonas Suotamo), they reclaim their former ship, finding Rey and Finn, Han explains that Luke tried to rebuild the Jedi Order, but a student turned to the Dark Side, Luke went into exile and all he built was destroyed. The five escape on the Falcon when attacked by criminal gangs, the gangs inform the First Order of Han's involvement, the Falcon lands on the planet Takodana, the group meet cantina owner Maz Kanata (12 Years a Slave's Lupita Nyong'o), who can help BB-8 reach the Resistance, Rey finds Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, it also belonged to his father Anakin. The First Order have converted a planet into a superweapon capable of destroying star systems, Starkiller Base, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) orders General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) to use the weapon for the first time to destroy the Republic capital and its fleet, Snoke tells Ren he must kill his father, Han Solo. Takodana is attacked by the First Order, Finn uses the lightsaber in a fight, Resistance X-wing fighters save Finn, Han and Chewbacca, they are led by Poe, but Rey is captured and taken to Starkiller Base, she resists Ren's interrogation and mind-reading, and Rey discovers her powers of the Force, using a Jedi mind trick to escape her cell. Han, Chewbacca, Finn and BB-8 meet Leia at the Resistance base on D'Qar, droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) explains that R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) has been inactive since Luke's disappearance, the group learn that BB- 8's map to Luke's location is incomplete. The Resistance plan to lower the planetary shield of Starkiller Base, before it will fire on D'Qar, so the fighters can attack, Leia asks Han to bring their son back alive; Han, Chewbacca and Finn infiltrate the base in the Falcon, the shield is lowered and Rey is found, and explosives are set. They encounter Ren, Han confronts him, using his birth name Ben, and implores him to turn from the Dark Side, but Ren kills his father Han, Chewbacca shoots Ren and sets off the explosives, the Resistance X-wing fighters therefore attack the weapon and the Starkiller Base is destroyed in a chain reaction. Injured Ren chases Finn and Rey to the surface, Finn is injured in a fight using the lightsaber, Rey takes it and overpowers Ren, who is wounded, they are finally separated by the ground crumbling, Snoke orders General Hux to evacuate and bring Ren to him, while Rey, Chewbacca and Finn escape in the Falcon. The Resistance celebrate victory on On D'Qar, but Leia, Chewbacca and Rey mourn Han's death, R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, Rey follows this to an island on a distant planet, and there she finds Luke Skywalker, offering him his lightsaber. Also starring Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma, Simon Pegg as Unkar Plutt, Tim Rose as Admiral Ackbar (voiced by Erik Bauersfeld), Pip Torrens as Colonel Kaplan, Rocky Marshall as Colonel Datoo, Heroes' Greg Grunberg as Snap Wexley, The Raid's Yayan Ruhian as Tasu Leech, Sebastian Armesto as Lieutenant Mitaka, Warwick Davis as Wollivan, Saw's Ken Leung as Admiral Statura, The Raid's Iko Uwais as Razoo Quin-Fee, 30 Rock's Judah Friedlander as Bar Patron, Thomas Brodie-Sangster as First Order Officer, Bill Hader as BB-8 Voice Consultants, Daniel Craig as Stormtrooper JB-007 and Ewan McGregor as the voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Ford, Fisher and Hamill returning makes the nostalgia all the more fun, newcomers Ridley and Boyega are fantastic talents, and Driver a great choice for villain, supporting cast members do great as well. I was hoping the feel of the fantastic originals would be reignited, I'm happy to say it met all my expectations, the story is well written and played out, the chase and fight sequences are highly exciting, and the special effects are amazing, this truly is a return to the good old days and I cannot wait for the next, a brilliant science-fiction fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Williams, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Production Design, Best Original Music and Best Sound. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Outstanding!this is pretty much what I expected It was inevitable that they were going to milk the franchise long after the story assumed to be done. "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" brings back the characters from episodes 4-6 and adds some new ones. Given the frequent one-liners and self-references, I get the feeling that the aim is to make all the nerds/geeks have fun. I will say that unlike "The Phantom Menace", I understood the plot this time; with the former, I didn't understand the plot until I listened to "Weird Al" Yankovic's song "The Saga Begins" (a parody of "American Pie"). So, it's no masterpiece. The plot is mainly two hours of light saber fighting and shooting lasers. Basically, if you go in expecting nothing more than stuff that's meant to appeal to the characters on "The Big Bang Theory", then you won't be disappointed. If anything important came out of the movie, I'd say that it's Carrie Fisher's shutting down of people who have nothing better to do than comment on her age. That's all that I have to say about this movie.good news, it's a Star Wars movie. bad news... not too much (but some) So the good news to report first is that J.J. Abrams is someone who loves Star Wars enough that he more than respects the mythology, which itself is cobbled together from past mythological stories, both old (back to the Greeks with the Gods) and modern (serials and comics), but also recognizes that in this 'Episode' series as a saga a lot of it has to come back to family. The Force Awakens works tremendously when it focuses on the two (maybe three) new characters who are introduced in this series, and the familiar is both welcome and sometimes questionable, but mostly welcome all the same. It's a movie made for the fans, but it's not necessarily a "fan-film", if that makes sense. It's the logical progression of this franchise in 2015 and by a filmmaker like Abrams it's a commendable effort (if not great, read on for more, and of course SPOILERS be ahead). First of all, the first act of this movie is magnificent. New heroes are introduced, one of which, a deflecting Stormtrooper for the newly formed First Order named Finn (though it's technically not his real name, and oddly enough his given name is an in-joke for ANH fans), is remarkable. I loved this character as someone who did seem like a new presence - not someone who is a space pirate or destined for something greater, just a guy who was raised to do just one thing and has a conscience and decides to act on it. As played by John Boyega he's the best part of the movie overall for me (yes, even with mother-f***ing Han Solo and the new cute droid BB8 included), and he gives Finn passion and fire and occasional humor but is a fully formed character; he's fulfilling the promise seen in him in Attack the Block, and I can't wait to see more of his character in the next episodes. Likewise Daisy Ridley, a new actress relatively, is very good as Rey - though she at first is another character (or I should say archetype) that's familiar via Joseph Campbell as the Hero Destined for a Journey, Ridley gives her spunk and equal fire to Boyega, and it's a joy to see how they meet and join forces in the first act. Everything about this opening is so strong, a lot of it told without dialog (and when it does come in it feels simple but just right somehow) that it's a shame that the rest of the film doesn't quite live up. And it's not that the quality jumps off a cliff, but, for me, this first act of shaping this new world, the new evils (Adam Driver as the new sort of "Darth" Kylo Ren), hits its high point once Han Solo (Harrison Ford, acting like he'd never left the role, he's just there) and Chewbacca come in to the picture. In a way the 'spine' of the movie, in other words the events that lead everyone from point A to B to C, are really close to that of A New Hope. At the same time, I got the feeling like Abrams, probably knowing this would be his only shot at making a Star Wars movie (whether he wants to do one again is his call, but I believe he's declined), has put EVERYTHING he'd want to do in a SW movie in one film. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and Abrams passion for thios world comes through in almost every frame. But it almost feels a little cramped by the time the last act comes around and as our heroes face off against Kylo Ren (following the death of a pretty damn prominent character, sort of in keeping with the family-tragedy line of the series, I can't even bring myself to say it), there's the "Starkiller" Base, which is basically the Death Star on steroids. It's a much darker film than I expected. Matter of fact, the third act has the sort of pacing issues to the point I almost forgot about the Starkiller Base plan, and it had not really much urgency considering its level of threat. It's also a little unclear just how FAST a particular character gets Jedi-Force powers (the explanation of Rey having them is fine, but it seems like just how quickly is too much, as if she would need more, say, training to do ALL that she does, and comes off more like a story contrivance). And by the time it gets to this section of the film, where emotions are really high but callbacks are still done - even to things like, say, a trash compactor, or an Admiral Ackbar appearance - it's a bit much. The number of gripes that I can ponder over are many... and yet I still recommend the film highly. For all the little faults in the storytelling or little bits of deus ex machina (at one point involving a split in the ground that separates two characters in a dual at just the right moment), this is a full-bloodied, extremely well directed, shot with fire in the cinematographer's cortex (and a lack of unnecessary lens flares!) Star Wars movie. In the ways that ultimately count, in the spine as I mentioned, its familiarity is in keeping with how this saga has been unfolding over six films, with familial bonds and the mystical element of the Force guiding things in directions of good and/vs evil. It does what the 2009 Star Trek film, also from Abrams, did so well: reintroduce us to this universe with energy and spunk, give fans and newcomers what they want, and allow some new actors to act their buts off while giving veterans a chance to shine. Oh, and BB8 is cute as a button. If only R2 had more screen time for them as a buddy-droid team...The search for Skywalker Thirty years after the destruction of the second Death Star and the overthrow of the Empire a new force has risen from its ashes; the First Order. Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, has disappeared and both the First Order and rebels, who are now known as The Resistance are searching for him. A map to his location has been found and given to rebel pilot Poe Dameron but the First Order's storm troopers attack before he can get it back to the resistance¬Ö he gives the map to his droid, BB-8, and tells it to get far away. Dameron is captured buy the sinister Kylo Ren but is helped to escape by defecting storm trooper FN-2187, soon renamed Finn. Their flight doesn't get them far though; they crash and it looks as though Dameron is dead. Meanwhile BB-8 is found by a scavenger named Rey; she shortly meets with Finn and, thinking he is in the resistance they manage to escape in a familiar ship. Their journey to the resistance base will bring them into contact with some familiar characters and into many life of death situations. We also learn why Luke has disappeared and the connection between Kylo Ren and the central trio from the original 'Star Wars' films. Anybody who has seen the original 'Star Wars' film will find the plot of this film very similar; this may be a problem for some viewers but I found myself really enjoying this and think it was probably the best film in the series since 'The Empire Strikes Back'¬Ö it is helped by the lack of things like Ewoks and Jar Jar Binks! The new characters were pretty impressive, in particular Rey and Finn. Their characters developed nicely through the film; this was particularly true of Rey as she starts to discover her strength in using The Force; thankfully the writers didn't rush to explain why she was so strong; no doubt we'll learn in later films. It was great to see many original characters even though Luke's appearance can best be described as a cameo or even a teaser as to what is to come in episode eight. While the overall story doesn't feature any major twists there is one very surprising moment for those who have managed to avoid spoilers. The cast does a solid job; newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega were great as Rey and Finn and of the original cast members Harrison Ford stands out as he has the most prominent role. The film features plenty of exciting action as some humorous moments which thankfully don't feel too forced. Overall I really enjoyed this film and heartily recommend it to fans of the original films.looks like a lot of people really hated it Somehow, even with all the hatred, Star Wars: The Force Awakens managed to bring in 2 billion.  Obviously the box office is no indication of whether or not a movie is good. The appeal was the reuniting of the original cast - Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Luke Hamill, along with Chewie and 3CPO, and to introduce some new characters to carry on in the next films. I have to admit, it looked like a big video game to me. What I enjoyed the most was Ford, particularly his repartee with Chewy. For me, it was great to see Fisher and Hamill again. These films that take place in space are yesterday's westerns and war movies. It used to be the science fiction films, the Buck Rogers, Superman, Dick Tracy etc., were B movies. Once the computer and CGI came in, they quickly became A films, perfect for the big screen.  Someone once told me that most movies are made for 15-year-old boys in Thailand. It makes sense - I mean, what was there to grasp about this film that a 15-year-old non-English speaking person couldn't grasp?  I haven't followed this franchise much since the first three films, though I did see the Anakin Skywalker-Natalie Portman movie. I think it's fairly obvious that this film brings us back to the original Star Wars.  Harrison Ford was paid $10,000 for the first Star Wars. His salary is higher now and he has a percentage of the box office. He's old, he looks old, but you can't beat him. He's an old-fashioned movie star in an old-fashioned movie. I didn't feel that Carrie Fisher had enough to do though I enjoyed her. So why give this an 8? Why? It was fun, it was entertaining, I loved the original stars. The new people -- Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac are all attractive and are very good. Will I go and see the next Star Wars? Probably, because Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are in it and somehow, so is Harrison Ford. That to me is Star Wars."This is not how I thought the day was gonna go." I've taken my time getting to this review, having seen the movie twice and allowing nearly three thousand other reviewers take their shot at the picture. I have mixed feelings about "The Force Awakens". As a stand alone movie I think it works well enough. It's got the CGI enhanced battle action down pat and the new characters add some fresh blood to the Star Wars universe which most of us expected. This is where I think I'll insert the 'but'..... To quote Han Solo from my summary line above - "This is not how I thought the day was gonna go." Another way to say it is - "Where was the magic"? I think I probably speak for anyone old enough to have been around for the original "Star Wars" in 1977. The first time you saw a land cruiser, or a hologram image of Princess Leia, or walked into the Mos Eisley cantina - man, that was magic. The legend of Obi Wan Kenobi had a mystery to it and you couldn't wait for that mystery to reveal itself. With this movie, it doesn't feel like the principals involved were interested in exploring a distant galaxy far, far away, instead directing their energy to the land of here and now. There wasn't so much a story here as the next evolution in computer generated special effects and characters created to appeal to a diverse cross section of movie goers. All well and good, but I think most Star Wars fans would welcome some serious character development and a story arc that anticipates an eventful wind up to the Star Wars saga. I don't expect that we'll get that now. Here's the one thing that did intrigue me out of the whole movie though, and I haven't read anyone else comment on it. When Han Solo follows Kylo Ren out to the bridge of the Star Killer base, he shouts out 'BEN' to which his son responds. See, this is the magic I was talking about earlier. It sounded to me like Kylo Ren was named after Ben Kenobi. If only the rest of the story could have been that cool.The Seventh Awakens Although if you either dismiss Episode 1-3 it could also be "the fourth Awakens". But back to this one and let me begin with, that I'm not even close to being in the top of the biggest fans, when it comes to Star Wars. I came late to the party and enjoyed the movies (some more, some less) and am not obsessed with the whole thing. Always liked Han Solo, especially the way Ford portrayed him. Having said that and not being able to be too detailed on every little inside joke, I can tell you that this feels like a Star Wars movie to me. Maybe it's on the surface and maybe some feel it is even too close to the Originals (copying certain things, paying respect as others would describe it). It's just the beginning of a new trilogy and 2016 has another Star Wars movie lined up, that is more of a spin off. So to see what the repercussions are (for surviving characters), you'll have to wait until 2017. As it is and as clich√© as some things go down (like our main "bad guy" here, so misunderstood as he would possibly say himself) and as predictable as others are, you will have a couple of wow moments and giving the new female lead some power to be doing stuff rather than just being there, this has a lot going for it. Maybe not the best Star Wars movie out there and interestingly enough the reaction was either love or hate (do people really think of this being worse than Episode 1? Wow). Embrace it for what it is, because it does capture what George Lucas was trying to do back in the day ...Pleasant and entertaining throwback to the 1970s Star Wars movies. My wife and I enjoyed this at home on DVD from our local public library. JJ Abrams did a good job directing this movie mostly in the style of the original Star Wars movies beginning in 1977. I've been around long enough to remember them well and the positive stir they created. I had a good friend who became a giant fan of the robot C3PO, who also makes an appearance here, 38 years after the original. Most of the running time and action involve a set of new, mostly younger actors. The bad guys want to control the galaxy (far, far away) and part of their plan is to find and eliminate Luke Skywalker, believed to be hidden away in a remote location. A map, stored on a solid state device, is the key. For me the most fun was their bringing back the main actors (and their characters) from the originals. Harrison Ford, who was in his 30s when all this started, is now in his 70s as Han Solo. His old ship, the Millennium Falcon relegated to a junkyard, serves a key role in the battles and as an escape vehicle.  Mark Hamill is back as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher is back as Princess Leia who has become a general, and Peter Mayhew, all 7 feet and 3 inches of him, is back as Chewbacca. Good movie and very entertaining, we enjoyed it. SPOILERS: Solo and Leia have a son, who has inherited some of his grandfather's (Darth Vader) powers is also leading the effort of the bad guys. There is a confrontation between him and Solo, where dad is trying to talk him into abandoning the dark side, but the son puts his lightsaber through Han who apparently then falls to his death.Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a good continuation of the series as it left off from 30 years ago As someone who grew up watching the original trilogy (that's the ones from '77-'83 that starred Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher), I was a little stoked to watch this one with those three returning. Ford appears the most in this and he makes the most of his presence. The funniest lines are from him and it's such a joy when he's on screen. Ms. Fisher doesn't seem as charismatic as in her previous stints as Leia but she's still pretty good at what she's required being now an older version of her. She and Ford have some nice scenes together. Hamill doesn't appear much so we'll have to wait for the next one in the series to see how he fares though I did like his beard at the end. The new players, mainly Finn and Rey, are good enough as characters. J.J. Abrams does a good enough job taking over for George Lucas. This was quite exciting for me and my movie theatre-working friend. So on that note, I recommend Star Wars: The Force Awakens.Episode VIII had better be fantastic. A fairly long time ago, in a county not so far away (Elstree Studios are an hour's drive away from yours truly), a great adventure took place. Now, J.J. Abrams, in league with the 'House of Mouse', has returned to make a seventh chapter in the franchise, and it's almost identical in plot to the first film, but with only a fraction of the magic and charm. Daisy Ridley plays Luke¬Ö sorry, I mean Rey¬Ö a scavenger on the desert planet of Tatooine¬Ösorry, I mean Jakku¬Ö who becomes involved in the rebellion against The Empire¬Ö sorry I mean The First Order¬Ö after she bumps into R2D2¬Ö sorry, I mean BB-8¬Ö, a droid carrying plans to the death star¬Ö sorry, I mean to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. Meanwhile, the First Order are preparing their new weapon, the Death Star¬Ö sorry, I mean Starkiller Base¬Ö for use against the rebellion, who are forced to launch a risky counter-attack that sees Rey coming face-to-face with masked villain Darth Vader¬Ösorry, I mean Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). I've learnt to keep my expectations low for Star Wars films since The Phantom Menace, so I can't say The Force Awakens was a massive disappointment; it is what I feared it would be‚Äîa rather safe reboot, lacking in fresh ideas, which aims to please younger viewers with flashy visuals, whilst pandering to the older generation by including sly nods to the original trilogy. Personally, I would much rather they had taken a bolder approach: let's be honest¬Ö they couldn't have got it any more wrong than the prequels. There's a spark of originality in the form of Finn (John Boyega), a stormtrooper who has a change of heart and joins the rebellion, the production design and effects are incredible, and I admit that the return of Han Solo and Chewbacca warmed even my cynical heart, but on the whole I was left wanting by this latest instalment, particularly the final assault on the Starkiller Base, which was completely bereft of tension. In fact, my favourite moment of the whole film is when Carrie Fisher tries to convey anguish, but her plastic surgery doesn't let her.Luke rewrites Matthew This is a replacement comment for the one written on opening night. I've had a chance to see it again, this time in 3D, and of course think about it. The big picture here is that the creative team made a modern film in the sense that it is folded, meaning it is about itself and how it presents other films. There are hundreds of examples of this of course, but this is the biggest movie in history, so something important is going on. In thousands of comments here, I've remarked on this new development, where more and more films have introspective dynamics. We are changing how we think, managing thoughts on at least two levels: the story and the story about the story, or how the story is presented. There is real power in this, because such introspection is a half step away from seeing yourself while being yourself, and that is half a step away from what might be called living the force. An example: the story in this film had to recycle elements from the previous ones (actually just the first two). What is our heroine about but literally scavenging elements from the prior films? Throughout, the term 'scavenger' is used as an insult but Rey carries it proudly. She clearly knows something about herself we don't. Our first scene with her matters. We have been transported with captured Poe into the hanger bay of a star destroyer, which Poe finds impressive. Immediately after, we have Rey rappelling into an identical bay from the last Star Wars saga. She will later fly through this and other parts of that wreckage.  About the handling of space. Other than story details, this had to have been much chewed over, because since the original films, our conventions of what a camera is have changed. The original two films were themselves intended to be retro in how they handled the camera. In 1977, the techniques attributed to Hitchcock and Welles were common, where the camera was no longer passive. It became our representative in the film, subtly indicating what we would do if we were there, or what role we would play. The camera could be curious, for instance, show revulsion or fascination. Lucas chose to have the camera be as it was in the 40's. This is one reason dePalma and Coppola thought the movie stunk. But that and the practical effects worked for us, indeed became part of what we loved. Now flash forward to a time where no action movie can be made without the active camera, the camera as our representative. What balance does Abrams find, but to have two film philosophies interwoven. In all the 'character' scenes, the effects are mostly practical and the camera is retro. In all the action scenes, the effects are mostly GCI and the camera is the modern one. The difference is striking because Lucas used a 1930 Howard Hughes dogfight movie as his template for the space battles. Here we still have spacecraft moving as if they were biplanes moving fast, but the weaves among them and among the camera are modern. (This was pioneered by Pixar, and their direct influence is obvious in the 3D version.) One final observation on the story reflecting the film itself. When Lucas and Kurtz invented the characters for the first film, they paid a lot of attention to archetypes. Most commonly cited is the work of Joseph Campbell but they more deeply studied the most popular of these, the Jesus story. (They didn't mention this for obvious reasons.) Think of Mark as history and each of the following gospels as episodes that added to the story. Mark (without the later ending) is about a preacher of parables with no special birth and no resurrection. Matthew in the next episode adds a virgin birth, influence from Persia and Egypt (then considered magical) and rising from the dead. Where Mark had him in the Nazarene desert, Matthew brought him into cosmic battle. The third episode written as 'history' emphasized Jesus role in building an order of followers, whose collective adherence to (lets call it) the force will sweep over the planet and redeem it. The devil appears here with his own order, the 'first order' chronologically created. One might assume that the name Luke Skywalker was random, or that it mirrored Lucas' name. But this is not the case, and this is something Kasdan understood. All he did was give us the Jesus story filtered through Kurosawa. Why mention this? Because Kasdan is again on the case and what he does is metaphorically overlay Luke on Matthew, giving us both.Finally...the Force awakens! Acclaimed J.J. Abrams directs and co-writes this STAR WARS installment. I remember watching the original with my best friend in 1977 and agreed this is a spectacle. What a hallowed franchise it has become. Although not being a faithful follower, my perspective of THE FORCE AWAKENS probably will leave a lot to be desired. Three decades have passed since the last episode had Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill)decide to hideout on a small mountainous island. Harrison Ford returns as a matured, and yet still charming, Hans Solo. Time as not served Leia(Carrie Fisher)well, although now the princess is a general who leads the Resistance. Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew)is still one of the most likable sidekicks ever. C3PO and R2D2 still look the same. Two likable characters will more than earn their entry into the franchise; John Boyega(Finn)is an AWOL stormtrooper, who meets a beautiful scavenger named Rey(Daisy Ridley), who has crafty skills equal to the best of any fighter. Poe Dameron(Oscar Issac)is a devoted pilot of the Resistance working for Leia. And a new malevolence, the First Order, spawns from the ruins of the Empire. FX are definitely special in the grand fashion one would expect. So much frantic action it is hard to find a place to sneak away for popcorn or soft drink refills. The detractors of this movie will be, of course, way out numbered by the serious Star Wars fanatics. The story line not exactly simple; but sustains the free thinkers with wide open imagination. Others in this cast of hundreds(maybe thousands): Max von Sydow, Adam Driver, Gwendoline Christie, Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyongo, Nick Walters, Dante Briggins, Dombhnall Gleeson and even Daniel Craig plays a stormtrooper. This movie proves to be one not to be missed. You don't even have to be a Star Wars fan. And definitely worth watching more than once.The next generation Star Wars is Fan-Tastic! One can only have deep respect and admiration for a genius individual like J.J. Abrams¬Ö I think one of the most difficult things to accomplish in the film industry is to revive a legendary and immeasurably popular franchise, but Abrams achieved in doing so not just once ‚Äì with "Star Trek" ‚Äì but now twice, with the even more astounding new "Star Wars" installment. "Star Trek" and "Star Wars" aren't just your average type of successful Sci-Fi movies, no, they became so humongous that they became immortal cult phenomena with millions of obsessive fans, countless of spin-offs and imitations and merchandising business that started to lead a life of their own. In order to appeal to this many skeptical and demanding fans, your film just has to be really, REALLY good! "Episode VII: The Force Awakens" is a fantastic film, and even though I'm not an avid "Star Wars" admirer, it was the first one since "The Empire Strikes Back" that truly impressed and overwhelmed me. Episodes I, II and III, that were released between 1999 and 2005 and directed by George Lucas himself, were not exactly worshiped by the die-hard SW-fans. Arguably that's because Mr. Lucas wrote and directed the prequels from a creator's point of view and not enough from a fan-boy's perspective. Abrams clearly is a big fan of the saga and probably knows more about Lucas' creation than he does himself, and that makes him the ideal person to helm the next generation of Star Wars cinema. "The Force Awakens" has a solid and absorbing scenario, breathtaking decors and set-pieces, spectacular action scenes (brought to an even higher level of awesomeness thanks to the exquisite 3D) and ‚Äì perhaps the most important of all ‚Äì a truly excellent and versatile cast of characters. First and foremost there's the return of some legendary heroes, of course, like Han Solo and Chewbacca, but also the newly introduced protagonists are fascinating characters. Personally, I've always been most attracted to the Dark Side, so I adored the new and powerful foe Kylo Ren (and particularly his private mental battle), the relentless army General Hux and the rather disturbing Supreme Leader Snoke. But also the good guys are extremely likable, like tough girl Rey and the reshaped Stormtrooper Finn. I can't wait for episodes 8 and 9!Slumber Earthquake. There really is no point trying to do an in depth review of this, it falls in line with a number of series blockbusters that are guaranteed to garner rabid responses, pro and con.  The Force Awakens is a film of many flaws, it has a pungent whiff of safeness about it, the charges of it being a glitzy remake are fair enough, while certain plot strands are frustrating and set to be big talking points for years - and years - to come. Yet what about its worth to someone who is not obsessed with every finer detail? Someone who just loves the Star Wars universe as a spectacle prism of entertainment, and has just wanted a Star Wars film worthy of being fit to sit alongside that original trilogy? This made me feel 11 again, took me back to a time in 1977 when I queued for three hours to see such wonders on the big screen. The Force Awakens is, in spite of the recognised flaws, a loving homage to a past love. It's sly with humour and nods to foundations, a blitzkrieg of effects and sound work (my Blu-ray viewing had my sub-woofer doing a jitterbug in the lounge), and it doesn't shy from surprise or the dangling of the carrot. The makers have big heart and technical invention, the cast vibrant, spunky and strongly committed to the cause - the old hands a very reassuring presence - Yeah, so it's not sci-fi perfection, or any Star Wars geeks' idea of the perfect Star Wars movie (oh J.J. Abrams you devil you!), but it made this middle aged guy shed a tear of happiness. A moment to reaffirm why - as a young lad - I fell in love with film in the first place. 9/10A Star Wars Reunion Movie The release of Star Wars this year is definitely going provide a lot of excitement especially for the people who have been given a lot of entertainment and enjoyment by series of movie that have been released in the 70's,80's and 90's. But this time,a lot of the fans are highly anticipating this movie because it will definitely the stars from the first installment of the Star Wars trilogy that are appearing like Harrison Ford,Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher.It will be sort of a like a reunion movie especially since the last movie that they have made was more than 30 years ago. Star Wars: The Force Awakens which is also known as Star Wars: Episode VII ‚Äì The Force Awakens will take off thirty years after the events that occurred after Star Wars: Episode VI -The Return Of The Jedi.The First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to eliminate the New Republic which is backed by The Resistance,which is led by General Leia Organa.She opposes them and starts to search for her twin brother to enlist his aid.The story progresses with General Leia's search for Luke Skywalker. Well,it was an enjoyable movie.No question about it.We are treated to better cinematic effects and better production values especially with Disney in charge of this trilogy.Added to that,we are also treated to great storytelling that would definitely reignite the fans' enjoyment of the up-and-coming series.Although I must say that we are going to be treated to the same formula which have made it successful and it would not be something new which many disappointed fans expected,it was still a great joy to see something updated for the modern audiences and done successfully.Personally,I think that there is no need to change the formula for as the saying goes,"Why fix it if it ain't broke?"A new hype 1977 was a big year in the cinema. Star Wars (later titled Episode IV-A New Hope) came out. It was a big year for me as well. I went to see my first James Bond film in the cinema. Star Wars I saw some years later on television, which as my brother said 20 minutes in. It is just some characters walking in the desert. JJ Abrams who ran out of ideas by the time he went on to direct Star Trek: Into Darkness has not waited long to reuse old ideas for Star Wars 7. Just as Creed carries on the Rocky saga by going back to Rocky 1 &amp; 2, Abrams with Lawrence Kasdan &amp; Michael Arndt has gone back to A New Hope to set up this new trilogy. We are back to the world of Star Wars and with advances in technology, special effects, CGI and animatronics we have not advanced much in visuals from the original trilogy which is over 30 years old from The Return of the Jedi. The visuals are uninspired and rather lazy. We have a Tattooine like planet where a young woman, Rey meets a droid carrying important information regarding Luke Skywalker. Rey comes across Finn a storm-trooper who has had a reawakening of his own and met a rebel fighter to escape. Rey seems to be feeling the force and in a series of coincidences or I guess the power of the force escapes her pursuers in a wreck which turns out to be the Millennium Falcon and later comes across Han Solo and Chewbacca. That is not all the Darth Vader like baddie is the grandson of Darth Vader, the son of Han and Princess Leia who has gone over to the dark side but still conflicted with the power of good. Their will be a father and son reunion and you can all guess how this will turn out as the scene is reminiscent of when Obi Wan encountered Darth Vader. It is entertaining, they put on all the right beats with action scenes coming at the right time and some humour, star cameos such as Daniel Craig voicing a storm-trooper or an actress, Harriet Walter who is the niece of Christopher Lee. It is just the story has been recycled and you think that after 30 years, this is the best they could do? If Lucas wanted a new trilogy he might has well remastered and re- edited his original trilogy because I know where this is heading.The best episode since the original trilogy (This review contains a SPOILER at the end!) I watched it last Saturday at TGV Cinema, Cyberjaya. To me, being a Star Wars fan since childhood (I was 4 when I watched the original Star Wars in 1978) this episode brought my childhood back during the 2 hour plus duration (unlike the prequel trilogy!). All the favourites were there: Han Solo, Leia, Chewie, Luke, R2-D2, C3-PO, etc. And the new cast were great as well. It had it all - exciting battles and lightsaber action, family drama (soap opera in space?), etc. I must admit - I cried when Han met Leia again and my wife was amazed looking at my reaction! I would give it a 5 out of 5 stars. Perhaps the only disappointment I had was at the end when Rey met with Luke (is Luke going to reveal that he is her father in the next episode?) and he didn't utter a word! Anyway, great job JJ Abrams and team, and to be honest, I can't wait for the next installment (Episode VIII)!Disappointment Before I saw the movie, I'd already read some bad reviews. I'm a huge SW fan so I decided to go see it. I couldn't believe how poorly made this film was. Acting was mediocre to say the least with the exception of the droids and Chewbacca. The old cast trio acted very little in the film, especially Mark Hamil who appears only a couple of minutes. The light saber fighting scenes were poor and uninspired. I don't want to go into EU, non-canon issues as that's a personal opinion. For me it was a bad mistake not to follow the EU with all the epic material out there. I mean there is material right there, served on a golden platter. The villains were weak as it's usually the case with Disney's movies, all talk but no backbone. To have the main villain, the leader of the "First Order", be defeated by a girl who never touched a light saber before in her life... that spells disaster in my books. Where is the ominous presence of Darth Vader, Count Dooku, Darth Sidious, Obi Wan etc.? Where is the epic atmosphere of the previous films? What of this "Supreme Leader Snoke"? He looks like Gollum! Where on the galaxy did they find Luke's/Anakin's light saber and stored it in a chest in a basement?? That light saber was cut off Luke's hand and dropped in the chasm of Bespin's bottom (probably down in the ocean) in episode V. How did Kylo Ren find Darth Vader's mask? That was burned on the moon of Endor some 30 years ago. Finally the story. Ah the story, it seemed to me I was watching a remake of Episode IV... come on! Another bigger, badder Death "Planet"... No background, no nothing. I really do hope, George Lucas buys back the franchise, disavows this film, and makes a proper one. I give it a 2/10 grade, 1 for the SW logo and 1 for the past films. No more.Great film with some minor Flaws ** Spoiler Free**  This movie is great , people are complaining its a New hope remake and I was worried about it , but after seeing the film I can tell you with all honesty is a DAMN good film and a excellent star wars movie. -the good- X-wing vs tie fighter fights, Light-saber fights are emotional , Great humor , Great Villains -the bad- some characters needed more screen time , the score is not bad but for a john Williams score i was underwhelm , Some scenes are cut too fast (cant Appreciate all the creatures)  -the ugly- some CGI characters stood out too much because everything else are practical effects.A New Hidden Fortress Awakens feat. Voldemort and Professor Snape How come, when JJ Abrams and co. set out to continue the saga, they felt the best option was to simply remake A New Hope, which already was a re-imagining of Kurosawa's classic 'The Hidden Fortress'. Now we end up with three movies that are practically the same. What sets this movie apart from A New Hope is the inclusion of Voldemort, Professor Snape, a far more saturated image, steadicam and lens-flare overkill, a far more pronounced machine vs. nature theme (general Organa? wtf? Lets not make star wars into Avatar please) and an inverted "I'm your father complex" times two. I've been a long time fan of the original Starwars trilogy, like many others, and when I saw the first ratings of this movie I was stoked. It started out pretty good, but as the movie went along it became utterly frustrating because of the sheer laziness that went into constructing the plot. If you've never seen the original trilogy (which you should, obviously) and you're only familiar with the current trend of the over the top, candy-esque, box-office spectacles, you'd probably enjoy this movie. As for me, I'm not sure if I'm going to continue to follow the new saga. I'll probably stick with the original (despecialized) trilogy.awful star wars movie ever first of all new charters are very weak ,starting new bad boy :),girl and new boy is also looks like coming from cheap TV show series second, movie start very good first hour was good then suddenly you start to get bored and telling your self what is going on :) i really get very excited when i first hear new star wars movie coming and ,when i was watching the movie i pray the god to make me blind . i don't like the director when i first hear he will direct new star wars i said no , and bingo i was right please be honest your self and do not vote because it is just star wars new series what is the problem in Hollywood i don't know but nowadays we are watching just propaganda movies or expensive production but boring story based movies please if you gonna make our favourite movies worse please do not make it like terminator 3 etc pleaseThe Force put me asleep. I've never done this before but I can't stand it anymore so I had to write something about SWVII. So for those who care to read it this is my take on the last Star Wars. Warning spoilers are included for those who haven't seen it yet. The only good thing about this film to me is the female lead. She's good and she has the right tough temper. Overall I'm very disappointed because of the lack of imagination. This film is mostly a copy/paste of the 1977 episode IV. Remember the droid sent with something hidden in it and found by Luke ? It's really disappointing that with a universe like that writers in Hollywood can't come up with something new, original and creative. But anyway that's what Disney does all the time (copy/paste good film recipes), so that's what they wanted and that's what they did. We even have to stand the same old ¬´ I disable the shields so that you can destroy the death star ¬ª which we've seen three times now ! It's so boring. The only surprise is that the death star is bigger ! Wow shocking ! The other weaknesses in the film are : - The Bad guy looks strong at the beginning which is promising but then gets his ass easily kicked by a girl who's not even a Jedi yet ! - The phony and unoriginal ¬´ last Jedi location map ¬ª and one piece of the puzzle map missing. - The Han Solo'son and reverse father/son relationship is predictable cheap and doesn't work for me. - It's nice to put Harrison Ford back in but he's there too much sorry. And now to compensate that he can't have the same action scenes as before they have added humour. Some are good but it's way too much. Sometimes it made me feel like I was watching a Star Wars parody. Also because Han Solo is an important character it creates an unbalance in the story since the true heroes are Finn and Rey. The light saber is a holly thing to me and that's what they want to show when Rey touches it for the first time and the all idea of going to this island to bring it back to Luke. But then why does the old woman proposes Rey to take it since she doesn't even know her much or it appears so ? Why also is it so simply passing to the hands of Finn so he can have fun with it a little ? It's nice coming up with the idea that Finn is a storm trooper who wants to break free but how do you make us buy that ? Why does he so easily escapes ? Why all the others don't do like he does ? Why is he the only one that thinks ¬´ oh my god I'm killing innocent people I have to stop ¬ª ? The beginning of the film up to the moment when Han Solo is coming back was promising then the Force put me asleep¬Ö If you want to see good truly imaginative, and gripping Star Wars films watch episodes IV, V, VI.The worst episode of all saga This is a very bad episodes for this saga. Inserting a funny afro American is a classic Hollywood stuff for a world wide pop up. Repeated story from the old episodes, really? For all this years they didn't design a original story. Don't know, but this is a big disappointment. Can't understand 8.5/10 for this comedy. Too much similar parts in the movie from the old episodes. OK, this is a movie for the kids right, but there is a too much aggregation for them. Don't know, but simple can't take this movie for a good, i hear too much laugh in the cinema hall for projection this movie like for a some Monty Python movie. Acting is good, but really John Boyega aka Finn is excess.Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Cringe List One fan's nit-picking is another's death by a thousand cuts.  1) Cool. Max von Sydow is in this, and he just said he needs to "make things right." This should be an interesting back-story! Oh, wait. They just killed him. Into the Mystery Box¬ô with the interesting back-story, Mystery-Wrapped until season, er, EPISODE 8 at the earliest, when I think we'll also learn about the Hatch.  2) Stormtroopers have advanced beyond quaint sci-fi blaster tech to embrace¬Ö flame throwers and Tasers. Finally.  3) Yay! It's the Millennium Falcon! Wait¬Ö how'd it get on Tatooine 2? Relax: I'm sure it's NOT just a convenient coincidence. There has to be a plausible explanation coming.  4) Cool! Rey is a bad-ass pilot! Oh, but, how does a teenage junk collector become an ace spaceship flier? I bet there's a Beggar's Canyon 2 on Tatooine 2! Or womp rats! Either way, I'm sure an explanation is forthcoming.  5) Why is the Falcon in perfect working order after sitting unprotected on the surface of a blistering sand planet for umpteen years? Obviously, Han went for the Clear Coat option.  6) Wow, in addition to the Clear Coat, the Millennium Falcon must have been majorly reinforced in the past 30 years, because it's now slamming against the ground and not completely disintegrating like most other spaceships that have previously slammed against the ground in this particular galaxy.  7) Did Finn really look toward the camera and say "Woo!" like he just crushed it in Call of Duty?  8) Oh sh**. Still no mention of a Beggar's Canyon 2 or womp rats. Oh well, another file for the Mystery Box¬ô!  9) And still no reason given for the famous Millennium Falcon's convenient parking spot on the same planet where all three of our fresh-faced protagonists converge. Another one for the Mystery Box¬ô (subject line: "For Smoke Monster Eyes Only").  10) Yay! It's Han Solo and Chewie! Wait¬Ö how did they manage to track the Millennium Falcon and then hyperspace jump directly to it 30 seconds after it took off from Tatooine 2? Faster- than-light-spaceship-tracking-and-travel has really come a long way in 30 years!  11) Finn didn't just ask if Rey has a "boyfriend," did he? Ugh, he did. Maybe they will later "hook up" in a spacemaltshop?  12) For a soldier indoctrinated from childhood to be a ruthless cog in the First Order killing machine, Finn seems to be a remarkably well-adjusted and affable lad, quick with the good- times one-liners.  13) Why does that one gang of space pirates sound like the cast of Trainspotting? And why does that other gang of space pirates LOOK and sound like the cast of The Raid 2? Dammit, why am I thinking about these other movies in the middle of a Star Wars movie? I don't want to think about hardscrabble Glasgow and gritty Indonesian street fighting right now. 14) Those escaped tentacle monsters look like Kang and Kodos from the Simpsons Halloween specials. Only more cartoony.  15) Why did Kang and Kodos immediately kill and devour the Scottish gangsters and the Indonesian Kung Fu gangsters, but not Finn? It's probably because he's so damn well-adjusted and affable.  16) Wow, Rey is also a master mechanic who can fix the Millennium Falcon better than Han and Chewie. It's almost like she's a Mary Sue, or something. But JJ Abrams and Jake Kasdan's dad are not ladies, so by definition, that theory would make no sense at all, and I'm probably a sexist pig for even considering it.  17) Finn, a First Order conscientious objector, apparently has no objection to slaughtering his former First Order comrades. And quite affably, at that.  18) Kylo Ren is talking to Stimpy the big Gollum hologram (Gollugram?) now. Ouch: People in the audience are chuckling at Gollugram's hammy stage voice. Now I'm chuckling, too. Dammit, JJ! I didn't want to chuckle at this point in the movie.  19) Why is Gollugram so damn big? Oh no: This better not turn out to be an Oz thing. And why does this CGI look so shitty? Oh, right: An industry friend told me two weeks before this movie's release that, despite JJ's claim that the film was in the can, little visual effects elves were still furiously working overtime on it.  20) Christ, another Cantina scene? This time with Broadway space reggae. I f***ing can't believe they went with another Cantina scene. Wait, while I was obsessing over this offensive victory lap of another Cantina scene, I missed why they decided to bring BB-8, the galaxy's most-wanted droid, into the Cantina instead of hiding him on the g-d space ship.  21) Oh no. More rush-job CGI in the orange Yoda. Looks like the effects elves cranked the subsurface scattering up to 11, because Mazda Yoda looks all watery-swimmy. 22) OK, why is Rey hearing spooky children crying in the basement? Is this like Lord of the Rings now, where magic inanimate objects have a voice? I thought Obi Wan said that the Force binds all LIVING things. Why does a hunk of metal now channel Force powers? 23) Finn just looked toward the camera and lovingly gushed, "That is a damn good pilot," as if he saw the cross-cuts of his his pal Poe in the cockpit along with the rest of us. And why did he look at the camera to say that? Does he want me to shout back, "Yes, I agree!"?  24) Oh for f***'s sake, I give up. (Storms out of theater.)Feel the Force once again... LOVED IT! There were many things I loved about this movie. As one who truly WAS THERE back in May of 1977 and who saw the first film 365 times in the theaters, Force Awakens was a trip back in time to reconnect with characters and a storyline from a galaxy long missed. Shot on FILM??? HELLO??? BREAKTHROUGH!! There's a vast difference in visual quality alone as well as those themes which weave through the storyline, you know when you're touching the spirit of those who were in previous films. No spoilers at all from this fan, I will simply say that I cannot wait until the digital version which I have already Pre-ordered surfaces so that I can watch it once again and reconnect with the vibe of the film. Many today for who this is their first exposure to Star Wars should watch the first trilogy, then the second, and then watch Force Awakens so the connect with the various homages to those films which exist in this one. Can't wait for the next Episode and I look forward to being able to see the final film of this new trilogy before I leave this lifetime. Enjoy the film and simply let yourself go into the world of that galaxy, far, far, away... and most of all...FEEL THE FORCEStar Wars is back! Very good movie. The prequels were so awful, this movie is such fun and a wonderful addition to the Star Wars family. The acting was excellent... such a change from the poorly acted prequels. The special effects were incredible and I loved the new robot. Just wish the movie didn't follow the original Star Wars movie so closely. But I'm sure the next movie will surprise us with wonderful new planets and lots of intriguing characters. It was so awesome seeing Han and Leia and Luke... and of course Chewbacca and the robots. i just hope the Death Star doesn't get used in any future movies... or if it is mentioned it's not the entire focus of the movie. But overall a fun movie to watch and I can't wait for the next movie.Guess the episode This is my first ever review on any movie on IMDb. So this means it's serious. So without spoiling it much here it goes: Just came home from the cinema, waited for this movie for so long and finally I can say that I've watched it. I should be ecstatic, overwhelmed, feeling like a little kid again, full of wonder and excitement and ready to boldly go where no man has gone before¬Ö Instead I feel scammed. Without spoiling much of the movie ‚Äì I know, it's practically impossible to spoil it now, a week after its global release ‚Äì I will try to explain why this was NOT the Star Wars I was expecting to see. As soon I left the theater a friend of mine asked me how it was. I replied with a 6/10. This was a conservative estimated score. The more I think about this movie, the lower it goes. Before you jump on my throat with a light saber, let me justify this. We were waiting for this movie for so long. The hype train behind it reached Trans-Siberian levels of anticipation. We demanded a damn good Star Wars movie, after the horrendous last three, we needed this one to be as good ‚Äì at least! ‚Äì as the original ones. Having taken this into consideration, we also expected this one to surpass the original trilogy. The year is 2015 and visually there is almost nothing that cannot be done. Almost 40 years since we first saw a star destroyer firing laser beams at that small diplomatic vessel, I was primed for an equally epic panning first shot. That never happened. I can say that I was concerned from the get go, from the scrolling text that puts you in the story, but this would be a spoiler. I can only say that this exposition in yellow letters is the second worst since the one in episode III. Since this a spoiler-free review, I am forced to talk about this movie in general. Let's start. Visually the film is stunning. I watched it in HFR 3D and it was as sweet as your mama's a**. However, the 3D experience is ‚Äì once again! ‚Äì completely useless. Unless your name is Cameron, no director ever needs to promote a 3D version of his/her film!! So I suggest you go and see it in 2d, BUT ‚Äì and this is important ‚Äì go for the biggest screen possible. You will thank me later. And this is where it comes crumbling down. Besides the stunning visuals, true and seamless practical effects and colorful scenery, this is an empty film. The scriptwriter is from the original trilogy ‚Äì Kasdan wrote episodes V and VI ‚Äì so you would expect a stellar story. Something along the lines of TESB and not ROTJ, less fur, more substance. Surprises to be included also ‚Äì mostly having to do with the family ties of the main characters. What we got was a rehash of the original one, albeit this is not 1977, we have seen this before and it's not going to blow our minds. Not anymore. We need something much stronger than that, something that is fresh, new, clever and above all F****ING ORIGINAL!!! Seriously Disney, you bought ILM only to make the same stories again and again??? No wonder some of the actors didn't want to play anymore in this new trilogy. This is not a NEW trilogy, it's the exact same story we've seen before ‚Äì TWICE actually! ‚Äì only with new actors. Even worse, they are given only a fraction of time to develop their character before they jump into an action scene, that makes no utter sense, precisely because we never got to be engaged with them. I never really gave a damn about Po, Fin, Rei or any other character in this film. F***, they even managed to ruin some of my favorite ones, like Chewie, C3-PO and Akbar!! This is the level of not-giving-a-turd-about-script that manages to destroy a franchise. Mercifully we were spared from another Jar-Jar (I feel dirty simply by typing that name) but this doesn't justify JJ's choice of making Chewie a walking carpet in this film ‚Äì literally! The same old recipe doesn't work anymore in this brave new movie world. My only hope ‚Äì a new hope! ‚Äì is the last 2 minutes of this film. Suffice to say that for me, they make this whole shipwreck of a movie worth it (you might need to study some Jedi lore to actually grasp the meaning of these 2 minutes). I'll have to wait till episode VIII to see a truly epic Star Wars again. But then again, the middle episode V was ‚Äì and still is ‚Äì the best one. The force just hit the snooze button and is going to awake in the next episode. (For the original review please visit https://livingbesideme.wordpress.com/2015/12/26/star-wars-the-force- snoozes/)From the ashes of LucasFilms shall be woken, A light from the Disney shall spring; Awaken shall be Force that was forgotten; The Star Wars is back as it should be Watching Star Wars VII will definitely gives you the shivers! The movie manages to combine the new with old, paying a lot of respect to the legacy (New Hope) and prepares a new SW generation for the future. There's no ultimate bad and good guys here, there are gray zones and that's what makes the heroes so interesting. Yes sir, there are plot holes, but I guess most of them will be filled in the next episodes. As for now I am 100% emotionally satisfied, as J.J.Abrams delivered more drama that I was expecting. The music is the weakest installment of all, but still J.Williams delivered a magnificent space opera (go listen to 'Rey's Theme').Not for cynics Kind of sad to see the number of 1 stars out of 10 reviews.  Are you kidding me? I feel bad for anyone that bitter.  Out of every hundred movies made there are easily 90 that are worse.  It's a good lesson that history repeats itself with different twists.  Great effects.  Great action.  Good characters. Leaves you wondering next steps.  Saw the first when I was 7 in theaters.  I am going to chalk these negative reviews up to spoiled brat unemployed millenials with nothi√±g better to do.  They are as a lot so entirely frustrated with their own personal failures that they can only derive happiness from tearing down others. Get a life.A little bit of a small disappointment I believe that I was a bit disappointed of this new follow up of Star Wars, not because it's that bad, compared to the latest (I, II, III), but because of the great response to the movie especially in here (imdb.com), which I'm using quite a lot, before choosing which movies to see in the cinema. Firstly, a lot of the scenes was taken directly from the old Star Wars movies (if you're Star Wars fans, you'll know which scenes that I'm thinking of). Secondly, the big bad villain who has been trained by a Jedi (the last skilled light sword and mind tricking master alive, that We know of), can't even win a light sword fight over a "common" Storm Trooper and a girl who haven't been trained at all. Lets remind ourselves, that he had killed all the other Jedi's that was trained by Luke Skywalker. Thirdly, Han Solo and Princess Leya, when he's ready for the travel to "save" their Son, it seems they are both getting ready for kissing each other, and suddenly he's hugging her in a very weird way instead. I must say this movie is worth watching from my point of view - BUT, I don't understand the score in IMDb. I know there's a lot of younger people giving points, but to see this movie reach as high in points as the old Star Wars movies (IV, V, VI), which were epic, for me screams out that something is wrong. As said before, this movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either - I know for sure, that if this Star Wars movie had been the first in a row of movies, I wouldn't have been as fascinated about Star Wars as I am, and I feel this movie is somehow taking advantage of the old movies. I hope the next movies in line will prove me wrong!Most overrated movie in history? What went wrong with this movie? Was it too much comedy? Or the countless plot holes and wtf moments I had while I was watching it? I really don't know. Were the first 10 minutes directed by the same guy, that did the rest of the movie? The movie had such a great introduction: dark, mysterious, violent. But it all went downhill from there... It's not only they took most of the story from Episode IV, there were so many scene that were just absurd and ludicrous. Han Solo popping out of nowhere, and the first thing he tells them is that "all the old stories were right". The whole scene felt awkward and forced (no pun intended) just to place it in the trailer. The first serious conversation Finn and Rey have is about her boyfriend... just horrible. Why does a stormtrooper soldier even ask this kind of question? I how did he turn from a trained killer to the Prince of Bel Air? When Kylo Ren took off his helmet I couldn't decide if this was Scary Movie 15 or Star Wars. He destroyed everything that made the Sith scary and fearful in 1 second.  There is one scene near the ending that is so incredibly bad it just makes you want to get up and leave the theater. It's a scene between Han Solo and Kylo Ren. This scene is a direct spit in the face to the bad-ass Han Solo we all know and love.The "Farce" awakens... *** May contain spoilers for who has not seen the movie or not been interested in Star Wars extended universe, books, games, etc. *** First of all I would like to congratulate J. J. Abrams for ruining the Star Wars Saga. This is a bad movie, a lousy script trying to duplicate the first Star Wars movie, episode IV, no depth, plot holes everywhere, and very bad acting. Adam Driver and John Boyega were both terrible. Boyega's character Finn was totally useless in every sense. Driver's Dark Jedi can only be called as a "Sith-Com", he reminded me of Rick Moranis' "Lord Dark Helmet" in Star Wars parody "Spaceballs". How can someone even think about about a lousy teenager Sith who destroys some panel in front of him when he gets angry about a failure and then returns calmly to say "Anything else?" Was that supposed to be funny? Can there be a Dark Jedi whose mastery about the force is so great that he can even paralyze his opponent in battle or stop a blaster rifle's energy shot in mid air for minutes, but cannot even win a light- saber duel with someone who has seen a light-saber for the first time in his life, that cannot even understand that it is a weapon? I am grateful that Darth Vader is dead and didn't see these happening. There were countless logical errors during the movie, especially in both opening and near the end, the bleeding injuries after being shot by blasters. Does Abrams think that blaster rifles shoot bullets? Hasn't anyone who has some logic didn't notice these kind of lousy errors? Only Daisy Ridley's acting was decent enough, but transforming her into a "Satele Shan" from Star Wars The Old Republic game trailers out of the blue and without any reason, with no training is non- sense. (And if we are to learn that she is Luke and Mara Jade's daughter in the next movie, it should have been mentioned in this one.) Almost every scene was predictable, especially the scene between the main villain and his father, which was a terrible scene, just put there to include a shocking tragedy, but unsuccessful. The final scene was supposed to be culminating, oh yes, the little girl finding her way to reach the long lost hero and reminds him of his duty by pointing out his ancestral weapon. At least duplicating Luke's search for Yoda in the Empire Strikes Back would be even better. In general, more than a film, this is some action filled scenes pasted one after other. And unfortunately just the presence of light-sabers or Millennium Falcon is not enough to call it a part of the Star Wars saga. The visual effects were good, but I personally think that the real success of the original trilogy was its minimalist atmosphere. J. J. Abrams shouldn't even be considered as a director, he clearly proves that he has no sense for cinema and knows nothing about "telling" a story. And it makes me think that the only thing he has seen about Star Wars may be Star Wars Rebels - The Animated Series. The level of seriousness is more or less alike.  The only good part is seeing Harrison Ford as Han Solo after all these years, but the way he was thrown into the story was truly amateurish, desperate to show him, but not knowing how to do. OK, you are trying to make a movie for kids but are your writers also elementary school kids? I rate 4 only because of Star Wars' sake.Review: Star Wars ‚Äì The Force Awakens (2015) WARNING: POST CONTAINS SPOILERS After nearly a decade, the Star Wars franchise blasts back on to the big screen in J.J. Abrams' long-awaited episode seven. The film is set some thirty years after the death of the Emperor and follows the search for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who has gone into self-imposed exile after the failure of his attempt to resurrect the Jedi Order at the hands of his apprentice, now named Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who was seduced to the Dark Side of the Force by Snoke (Andy Serkis), the Supreme Leader of the First Order that arose in the aftermath of the galactic civil war and is attempting to restore the Galactic Empire. With the Senate of the New Republic refusing to acknowledge the threat of the First Order, Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) has gone back underground and is the General in command of the resistance within the First Order's territory and is supported in a deniable fashion by some elements of the New Republic. To some viewers dismay, the original trilogy cast are secondary to the plot and this is very much a 'passing of the torch' film, with the new characters taking centre stage as it focuses on Rey (Daisy Ridley), a scavenger on the planet Jakku, and Finn (John Boyega), a defecting Stormtrooper, who meet on Jakku after Finn helps resistance fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) escape from the Star Destroyer he was being held prisoner on, and how they all are swept up in the search for the last Jedi. As with all Star Wars films, the effects are stunning and the action fast passed and thrilling, but my prejudices against Abrams' story telling abilities remain very much intact as the plot is a rehash of episode four with Lawrence Kasdan's writing efforts seemingly limited to ensuring the original trilogy characters remain true to form. Of the original trilogy characters, it is Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who drives a lot of the action forward as we learn that Kylo Ren is, in fact, his and Leia's estranged son, Ben Solo. Because the plot is a reworking of episode four, we could see very early on that Solo was the Obi-Wan figure and that he would meet his end at the hands of Kylo Ren in the same way that Obi-Wan died at the hands of Darth Vader. Even so, his death is a genuinely shocking moment as, even though we all saw it coming, it was still a surprise to see that the writers and studio had the nerve to kill off such a popular character. There are a lot of plot holes and gaps in the storyline such as how Han lost the Millennium Falcon, how the First Order came about and why they're not using clone Stormtroopers who are programmed for obedience, and who Snoke is and how he came to lead the First Order. I know that there is a trilogy of novels being written by Chuck Wendig to bridge the gap between episodes six and seven, but there's no guarantee that all of the fans will read them which means the pressure is now on episode eight to deliver a lot of this back story. Having said all of that, the writing is very well done with well-rounded and likable characters, good action set pieces and an excellent lead in to episode eight in 2017. One of my biggest gripes with the writing is that it was stressed that this would be a new storyline for the Star Wars universe and that it would not have anything to do with the story lines in the extended universe novels, and yet it certainly borrows from both the Heir to the Empire and Fate of the Jedi series so much so that I have to wonder why they didn't just film those books. Even with all of the above mentioned flaws I'd still recommend going to see it, but, for me, this was a six out of ten movie that just about escapes being a 'meh' moment.If you are a Star Wars fan, you will be very Disappointed People asked, "how was the movie?" Well, my wife slept through some of it,and I stepped out to use my cell phone." It was incredibly boring and mediocre: episodes 1-6 were much better than this. Episode 3 blew episode 7 away. It's as though Disney put forth the least amount production effort in the movie after acquiring the franchise and is counting on the cult status of the franchise to drive ticket sales; unfortunately it appears to be working. If you have read other reviews that state this is a regurgitation, or reboot, of a previous episode; they are not wrong. This movie lacks any new story line for us to enjoy, and the new characters are weak and underdeveloped. I didn't care if any of the "good guys" lived, or died. Again, very disappointing. We can't recommend this movieHey! lets put up a bigger death star this time or a planet maybe This thread contains crucial spoilers please proceed with caution. I still cannot believe how senseless and low IQ people the dark side folks are. They have already lost 2 dark stars (twice the same way and the same star) and yet this time they have a huge death planet but still the weakest point of the weapon is on the surface and penetrable. What is the point. Well the Empire never learn from the past thats what it looks like. On the other hand Jedi training starts from Padavan class which the Jedi candidates are so young and juvenile pupils. How could it be possible for a fresh starter Jedi young woman to be a match for almost a master Sith lord. JJ Abrams let down again as he always does.Just Plain Fun!!! I gave this movie a 10. Loved it to be honest. Seen it 2 times already. The 2nd time you kind of pick up on things you may have missed the first time around. It is worth the watch if you ask me. If you have not seen the First 6 movies I would suggest you do to get a better understanding of the whole universe. I plan on seeing it again next year in January, then buying it when it is released!!! I thought there were also some pretty funny parts as well. Now I can't wait for the next episode to come out, I am sure it will be just as good!!!! So for the New Year take your whole family out for a treat and watch Star Wars together!!! Happy New Year!!!People Need To Lighten Up. It Wasn't Great, but it was Fun. I am old enough to have seen every Star Wars film in their original runs and have been a fan of the franchise from the beginning. Seems like everyone wants to be a professional movie critic these days. I read reviews where people just want to complain at a level that tells more about how unhappy they are rather than taking a movie for what it it. Then you have the movie studio shills writing ridiculously positive reviews that makes this film comparable to Citizen Cane. Finally you have the hard-core fans that will not complain about this film under any condition. My message is simple...Lighten Up. I took my 9 year old to see his first major Star Wars film in a theater for the first time that he will remember and spend as much time observing the movie from a child's perspective rather than a cynical adults that spends as much time looking for the flaws than enjoying the ride. My son cheered when the good guys prevailed, cried when Han Solo died and has spent the last several days speaking of the film.  As Yoda said: "Truly wonderful the mind of a child is."  Now from the cynical adults perspective: It wasn't perfect. This was certainly a "Passing of the torch" movie where you have to deal with the aging original cast while incorporating the new cast of characters. I knew this was going to be troublesome giving ample screen time to everyone. To be honest, the way Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford have aged, they can no longer carry a Star Wars and sell the sizzle like they used to. Father time has caught them. I didn't have much of a problem re-treading some of the original concepts, but the film certainly went too far. The new Death Star plot was weak. The film did not need another "Ultimate Weapon". The Villains were not particularly meaning. I would call them almost comical. You will have a hard time finding a kind word about Kylo Ren. My biggest disappointment was they made this weenie to be the offspring of Han Solo/Leia and of course the grandson of Anakin Skywalker. I would have preferred this character to have been a non-related Jedi recruit that went rogue rather than a descendant of Skywalker. Although the new 3 main actors were obviously cast by race, sex and national origin I must say I liked them and they had really good chemistry.  I am going to take the perspective that after ROTJ, the Sith and the Jedi were pretty much wiped out and were are not catching them at their prime. I am hoping the next film cleans up some of the plot shortcomings. For now, enjoy the ride.At least they did not "rape" Harrison Ford this time. All the way back home from IMAX I was wondering why this particular one seemed to be for me the only not-so-awesome episode from all the ¬ÑStar Wars" films. Every other one I simply love and hold dear like a part of my childish memories, but this one did not have even a small part of epicness we could see in the previous movies. No scene will be remembered as a classic, no actor will become a new generation movie hero - neither a villain¬Ö The old faces from the original saga make this film good and it's not only a sentiment ‚Äì they are now much better as actors (Mark Hamill's look at the end of the film is¬Ö you just need to see that!). Unfortunately the young ones have much to learn and I am not only talking about the Jedi skills. My final rating is 7/10 and I sadly need to say I am simply disappointed as a ¬ÑStar Wars" fan. The character Rey, although as a mix of Keira Knightley and Natalie Portman, she's only a kid and it's hard to identify with the kids on the plan as they are very average in every aspect. On the other hand, Rey started better than young Anakin, so she still can show something better in next two episodes and I hope she will. Finn as a character was given a role of another Afro-American that needs to make a lot of ¬Ñwows" and he's overacting like the pilot in ¬ÑThe Matrix: Reloaded", so I just confirmed my concerns I had after watching the trailers. Kylo Ren is not even a shadow of Darth Vader¬Ö The soundtrack is nice, special effects are amazing (worth watching in 3D ‚Äì especially for X-Wings, Ties and a Star Destroyer). I think J.J. Ambrams did more good with ¬ÑStar Trek" to give it a new life. I expected much more than improving a visual aspect. Maybe it's a Disney thing¬Ö At least my wife loved it... And¬Ö they didn't rape Harrison Ford this time! I suppose we should be grateful for this detail.nostalgic feeling I must have watch the star wars movies few hundred times. JJ stayed in a safe zone in the story line. it seems like copy cut paste of the episode 4 - 5 - 6 ƒ± was hoping some original scenes and new vision to the franchise. What he did in star trek was great. but for star wars its to weak. Villain Kylo Ren needed more depth to it.. my opinion Disney is trying to reach out to new generation and create a new fan base.  Kylo Ren needed some serious dark side in him. I wish they got help from C.Nolan for that character. he would have made him a bad ass Jr.Sith lord. What C.Nolan dd with Joker character was amazing in Batman franchise. ƒ±t really gave me a nostalgic feeling our expectations are high for this Saga. ƒ± have to say Fin is great Daisy Ridley is a great choice for the role. for Kylo they needed somebody else casting department for kylo failed.Typical bland joyride - no depth I found myself really trying to like this movie...it was hard. Was it all bad? No, of course not. Most any bad movie has its virtues.  I don't even know if I'd call it bad, just...not good. *spoilers* Both of the new main characters basically had no past worth mentioning. Finn had the upbringing of an automaton, and Rey was stuck on a desert planet to scavenge by herself, with apparently no friends. Finn wants to leave. Rey doesn't. That's honest to God the only difference between the two characters as far as actual character is concerned - level of courage - which gets switched around as the movie progresses, making the two completely interchangeable.  Reactions to events in the movie are dry and unfeeling. *HUGE SPOILER* Let's not lose sight of the gravity of what the first order did in this movie. They are most likely authorities on the strength of their enemies. And according to them - They JUST BLEW UP THE REPUBLIC. THE CORE OF THE REPUBLIC, PROBABLY CORUSCANT ITSELF!!! Take the population of Alderaan and multiply it by at least 50 for that planet alone!!! And there were at least 5 planets destroyed! Was anyone affected? Did anyone react, beyond "They've just wiped out a whole solar system!" Almost saying "That bratty kid, look what he just did to those planets!" Hello!!! We're talking PROBABLY 50 TRILLION PEOPLE. You know how in Abrams's Star Trek, Vulcan gets destroyed, and the whole rest of the movie has the pain of Spock and the goal of justice for the Vulcans as the driving force of the movie? Right? You know how force sensitives could sense Alderaan's destruction? There was NOTHING. There are multiple other examples - these are just the big criticisms that underlay the fatal flaws of this movie as I see them. The characters are bland, the relationships don't feel real, and nobody cared about what they were doing. I couldn't feel anything in this movie. I wanted to like it, badly. I wanted Star Wars to be given new life, but I left this one numbed by the gaping vacuum I had just experienced. JJ. You can do better than this, don't be afraid of the new franchise. Don't be afraid to take risks, to crate a new equal chapter of this cultural icon. Don't hesitate to make us feel something, for fear of tampering with what we've all hailed as theatrical perfection.  Your other movies prove you've done this same formula, and far better than this. What happened???I can feel the hate swelling in you now! A review for the fans. The film is a masterpiece of escapism entertainment and so what if the template was borrowed in part from previous Star Wars movies (especially the original trilogy) ‚Äì those movies worked! I'm not surprised at all with some of the hate filled reviews on here, I guess you can't please all of the people all of the time ‚Äì only the vast majority of the developed world who can afford a ticket. Admittedly nostalgia levels were very high, but I felt as though they were warranted when I watched the finish article, as all boxes were ticked. *Potential very small spoiler* I particularly enjoyed the quite literal 'Force Awakening' scenes with the main force sensitive characters (not yet Jedi or Sith), who in some cases were literally fighting for their lives with zero training and a yet unknown midichlorian count. I'm looking forward to being able to share the experience with my 6 year old son one day soon, I'm sure he won't be dissecting the plot, drawing parallels with the originals and complaining about a "lack of vision". The torch as finally been passed to a new generation, well done JJ and company!JJ Abrams delivers on high expectations with a true Star Wars movie! Star Wars is back, as JJ Abrams achieves a small miracle in creating a movie that respects its original material, brings in a ton of new characters, makes it appealing for new viewers and sets up a story to build a new Star Wars trilogy on.  Without giving away too many spoilers, the story revolves around a scavenger(Rey), a renegade stormtrooper(Finn) and a fighter pilot(Poe) in their quest to defeat an enemy with the power to endanger the galaxy. To be honest, superb acting has never been a strong point in any of the previous Star Wars movies. This trend has thankfully been broken, as the stellar cast give great performances throughout the whole movie. The newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, playing as Rey and Finn respectively, prove themselves more than capable of carrying the load in continuing the saga. They both show great chemistry together and give us extremely likable characters, with Rey bringing the heart of the film and Finn the abundant energy. Oscar Isaacs, who plays Poe, is the veteran among the young cast and pulls of a cool and smartass X-wing pilot. And finally, the old cast returns to give this film a true Star Wars feel to it. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo and has not seemed to skip a beat since 1983, as he is as cheeky and badass as ever. His witty banter with Chewbacca is a pleasure to watch, but Ford also brings a strong emotional performance this time too. Carrie Fisher as Leia also returns, in a rather small role, and delivers some sweet scenes with Han and the new cast. However, the most complex character with the best arc in this movie, is the antagonist Kylo Ren. Ren, played by Adam Driver, gives us an extremely intimidating villain with a troubled past we are eager to discover. Ultimately, he serves us more than a Darth Vader wannabe. JJ Abrams, alongside Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt, wrote a fun and entertaining screenplay with plenty of emotional plot twists and content. Each main character has its own background and motivation, which develops over the duration of the film. A pleasant surprise to see is the humor used in the movie. The comedic relief in the film was used very effectively in developing chemistry and sympathy for the characters. It is also a sign that the movie does not take itself too seriously as the prequels did.  The Force Awakens is filled with exhilarating action and moves with great pace during these scenes. Yet, Abrams knows to slow it down during scenes conveying intense emotion giving the audience time to process all that is thrown at them. These combined make it easy to understand the main characters' motivations, making the emotional investment so much better. As is typical of Star Wars, the movie is full of awe inspiring visual images and astonishing sound editing, creating new sounds for laser beams, light sabers, and alien noises. The cinematography is equally impressive, showing beautiful landscape shots of new planets reminiscent of the original trilogy. The cinematographer, Daniel Mindel, also shows us a diverse array of shots, giving heart-pounding POV shots inside the cockpit and nice long shots of the battlefield giving it a great scope while avoiding confusion caused by the numerous explosions. John Williams makes a welcome return to the Star Wars franchise with a bombastic new score, but also with nicely timed inserts of his famous original music to bring up emotional heartwarming feeling among the old- school fans.  In conclusion, The Force Awakens is a return to form for the Star Wars franchise, as JJ Abrams gives his tribute to the original Star Wars, leading to a fanboys' dream. This beautiful reunion of old characters combined with the introduction of promising new characters results in a nostalgic and emotional adventure trip that left me excited for what is coming next. To quote Jimmy Kimmel, this movie was probably "the most anticipated sequel since the New Testament". So expect this movie to be under the most intense scrutiny by reviewers as they dissect the movie to its core to find the tiniest flaws. Nobody wants to be "Phantom Menaced" again. In the end, The Force Awakens delivers as a fantastic Star Wars film and a worthy addition to the franchise. It is definitely the best Star Wars movie since 1983 and, in my opinion, the best one since The Empire Strikes Back.I might become a Star Wars fan! I liked the first two films (A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back), but while I could certainly enjoy them and appreciate the MASSIVE cultural impact of both of these (Return of the Jedi can get lost), I was never really a Star Wars fan.  Watching this, though, I think I might become one! I don't care if it offended a few hardcore Jedi Nuts - I thought it was brilliant. A universe that felt real, rather than just a string of special effects sequences; engaging dialogue; characters I cared about¬Ö Of course there were plot holes here and there, and yes that's the third time they've used the giant ultra-destructive space station thing, but you can't please everyone.  Bonus points for a strong female lead (played by the EXCELLENT Daisy Ridley) who isn't just a plucky, sexy foil for a male hero. Now bring on the flame! yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.comI'm very happy this movie came out this is one of the best movies i've ever witnessed, it truly made a great appearance after a long absence (prequels don't count) and it has the same feel as new hope which is absolutely amazing. i liked how they introduced each lovable charterer in a unique and magnificent way, and it had humor in it with C-3PO, R2-D2 and the millennium falcon, i liked BB-8 a lot, i think he alone made the movie a great experience and i never got disappointed at any time along the movie, and the new characters don't fail at drawing a bright smile on your face, they totally fit in the star wars universe as we know it. overall i think it's fantastic and it deserves every single dollar it gets. 10/10Waiting for that so long! I have seen a new hope at cinema when I was 7 Years old, since then I love movies and I love Star Wars, Episode I-III was a great disappointment but now J.J Abrams gets the old Star Wars feeling back to me. Even when this movie have some flaws it was one of the greatest movie experiences for me ever. Most of the actors did a great Job, but Daisy Ridley was really amazing in this movie, because of her Rey is my new favorite character of the whole Franchise. I will watch Episode VII a second time in cinema and then I think it will get the 10/10, that I only give after a second viewing. Don't miss this movie at cinema, you will regret for all time!Watch this movie The best Star Wars movie so far me !J.J.Abrad did excellent work in this prozect with Disney company and we can not wait to see the other films of saga.he seventh installment of the Star Wars film series, it stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Max ON Sydow. Produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and Abrams' production company Bad Robot Productions and distributed worldwide by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, The Force Awakens is set 30 years after Return of the Jedi; it follows Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron's search for Luke Skywalker and their fight alongside the Resistance, led by veterans of the Rebel Alliance, against Kylo Ren and the First Order, a successor group to the Galactic Empire.JJ Abrams made Star Wars cool again! JJ made something that previous trilogy missed; strong characters! Star Wars are back on track as we return to essentials: lovable, heartwarming and inspiring characters. Rey and Finn are future of saga! BB-8 had same effect that R2D2 had in original trilogy and known characters fit in well. Maybe Adam Driver as Kylo Ren wasn't something that I am thrilled about, but it's probably because of bias I have about him (watching "Girls"). But generally I think he will be okay in the next movies in this trilogy. All in all, Star Wars are back to its best! Pure 10/10Freaking amazing! I simply cannot comprehend how anyone would give this a bad review. It was, without a doubt brilliant.  The directing was amazing, to the point where you're so immersed in the scenes, I actually felt giddy during some of the flight scenes, it feels like you're actually IN the ship. The special effects are tastefully done, and are a perfect follow on from its predecessors. Nostalgia rules in this thrilling film, we felt like applauding several times throughout, and got goosebumps in some amazing scenes. It was also surprisingly humorous, (in appropriate amounts), and the balance of new characters versus returning characters and story lines was brilliant.  10 out of 10 for me!All Real Star Wars fans loved it, and clearly so did the average viewer. The inarguable facts (AKA the record-breaking box office) speaks for itself ; ) Before watching The Force Awakens, I was slightly skeptical. However, I can safely say I am now a HUGE fan of the Star Wars universe! The Force Awakens stands as a rock-solid foundation of a promising trilogy, which will easily surpass the original trilogy if this incredibly high standard of film making is carried forward. Clearly J.J. Abrams enjoyed every minute of work when directing this movie, and he expresses his love for the Star Wars franchise extremely well by respecting the original material and cleverly linking the trilogies and simultaneously building new, strong characters who rival even the classics such as Han or Luke.  Overall, I would say that TFA is a must-see movie, not only for fans of the Star Wars franchise, but for anyone who has access to a television screen.  J.J Abrams does an absolutely masterful job at showing his love and passion for Star Wars, and the finished products (Yay Episode 9!!!!) will all go down in history as some of the greatest films of any trilogy in history.Awesome Movie I have seen Star Wars in 1977 and since then I have seen all the episodes muliple times. The force awakens is one of the best entries in the series if not the best one yet. I do not understand any negative reviews especially by the so called original fans. This movie is awesome and outstanding. Kylo Ren is the best Star Wars villain yet. Yes, he is whiny, jeaulous, insecure and weak but that is what makes him so dangerous and unexplainable. The young actors are by far better than Hamill, Ford and Fisher were in 1977. Especially Daisy Ridley does a very good and very convincing job. By the way the movie is set to entertain and that is what it does perfectly so. 10/10 for sure!As Good As The Originals I do not at all understand these negative reviews. People say it's unimaginative, repetitive, and just terrible, which are all wrong descriptions. Just because it has elements of the original movie does not mean it's unimaginative. In fact, if one likes the originals, then how could they be mad at seeing something that is similar to that? Also, aside from the few similarities between this and A New Hope, there are a great number of differences that people who negatively view this movie purposefully overlook. For example, besides the giant space station, basically the rest of the plot is different from the original. There's not much else I can say, as I don't want to spoil anything in this review, but the only reason people give this movie bad reviews is because it's made by Disney, who has no hand in the actual creation of the movie itself, just the budget, and because J. J. Abrams wrote and directed it instead of George Lucas, therefore they automatically hate it because they look for all the tiny flaws and expand them instead of looking for all the amazing things in the new movie.Coming Home Rey, a scavenger barely eking out a living, needs to go home. She will do what she can to support the resistance, but she needs to come back to her planet. Nothing remains there for her but a hope that something or someone will find her. Fate decides otherwise. A force, maybe even "the force," compels her otherwise to abandon home. Her awakening, though not completed by film's end, is what makes this film a triumph. And the cliff-hanger ending leaves you puzzled, yet satisfied that there are more revelations ahead. While you might think you have the answers, do not be surprised if you're surprised by next installment. Some have said that this episode is a reboot of "A New Hope." On the surface that might be a fair comment, but it seems to miss the point. Rey wanted to stay home-bound, hoping "something" or "someone" would find her. Away from home, she is now in a galaxy so very far, far away . . . . Now, so far away, has she found what she lost so long ago?  Cue John Williams, buy your ticket and wait in your seats for Episode VIII.Nothing like Original or Prequel Trilogy Star Wars The Force Awakens has a lack of imagination,it is anything but original and to me and my family ruined that feeling of all the other star wars films (including The Phantom Menace) if anything the only good thing about the movie is the appearance of the original cast (Mark Hamill,Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford) and the music of John Williams,but everyhing else makes me wanna immediately go to sleep or leave the theather.I think this movie failed to bring star wars back and I hope that the sequels are at least a bit better than this movie otherwise Star Wars might be over for me.This is my opinion and if anyone agrees with me is welcome.awesome While its not perfect by any means, The Force Awakens as a whole was incredible, just absolutely breath-taking. The cast and the performances were great, the characters were grounded and felt actually interesting while maintaining a skillful balance between nostalgia and future. Everything about this movie is just so perfectly executed and played out. As I said, the characters had real conflict and emotions that the audience connects with and relate to, literally no character in this film was uninteresting by any means. Sure a lot of it plays off of A New Hope and there some things about the movie that I felt were a bit off, mostly that Rey was able to pick up her use of the force and demonstrate it as if she was a trained Jedi as well as fight Kylo Ren with absolutely no light saber based training. But overall, I could not believe how good this film turned out to be, its easily one of the best films 2015 and Star Wars has to offer and would recommend for both new fans and old.The Rebirth of a Saga Star Wars The name that gives hope, excitement, adrenaline, and so many other emotions for people that love this franchise. Growing up I loved Star Wars it was one of the first movies I got into as a kid(I first saw it when I was about 3-4 years old long after the original 3 had their theatrical run) Luke Skywalker was one of my on screen heroes and Darth Vader one of the most evil bad guys I had ever seen. Lucas for years had been saying he had no intention on making a sequel trilogy and I figured Id take his word for it after all he was getting older and preferred to have other people helm the directors chair(such was the case early on with the prequels but he changed his mind) but then he sold the franchise to Disney and as soon as the purchase was done it was announced a new sequel trilogy was being planned(Not prequels, not in between movies but A SEQUEL TRILOGY) I was excited and damn I couldn't wait! Now it's the end of the year and "Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens" has been released and the only thing I can say is I LOVED IT!!!! Without question if you are a big Star Wars fan then you wont be disappointed, as a fellow fan myself I can say this film is what we've all been waiting for years(a sequel with the original characters). These films are fun and enjoyable and of course there are many parents out there that are looking forward to introducing their children to the new films but the film, as much as I love it; isn't without its flaws. I guess the one thing that people complained about was that the film seems to be just another version of Episode IV A New Hope and indeed I can see why they say this. The film has almost the same formula of the characters trying to find and get a droid to its destination because it has information vital to the resistance and the use of the Starkiller which clearly was the Death Star Revamped and updated to be more powerful and deadlier than the first, but at the same time it was original in its own way. The movie basically made use of Homage which was one of the things I loved about it, its been over 30 years since we saw these particular characters and it was a nice way for fans of the originals to see the homages while showing us new stuff.  One of the themes in Star Wars is temptation, temptation to do the wrong thing(Anakin being tempted and succumbing to the Dark Side but then his son Luke resisting temptation and redeeming his father) but this film did something a bit different and that was Temptation to the Light side, Kylo Ren is on the fence about going back to the good side but doesn't want to and wants to stay part of the dark because he believes its his birth right(there are more reasons than just this of course) so he's dealing with wanting to go back to the light and although this was very briefly touched upon in ROTJ(Vader having some good in him) this addressed it in more depth and emphasized wanting to stay bad rather than go good rather or vice versa. The original films are admired for their special effects, without question one of the reasons the original films look so good is because of the effects they used(mostly practical, puppetry, and even early computer graphics) which gave them an organic feel and made us all believe we were seeing living creatures on the screen; If we watch those films today they still feel like they were made just yesterday like they're not that old(one of the reasons these films are timeless) and The Force Awakens decided to stick to this tradition, rather than use complete CGI(as the prequels did) these used the more practical effects(of course there were still instances of CGI frankly you cant get around it) the use of animatronics and props made this film believable again(as though what we were seeing was really there) that's one thing for sure fans of the original trilogy are going to love. Star Wars is a saga that millions of people enjoy, it's the classical tale of Good vs. Evil and its mythology is so addicting its just hard not to like it, these films changed cinema and continue to influence the minds of film makers and these newer films are basically the franchise handed to a new generation for us to have a chance to make them for a newer generation and cinema in general. We have new films coming out Star Wars episodes VIII and IX and of course the Anthology films(ill be pretty busy these next couple of years) and I tell you I cant wait to see the next ones.Fantastic return to that galaxy far, far away... Amazing movie that exceeded all my expectations. Been a fan since 1977 and it made me feel like a kid again! Love the new cast, especially Rey and Kylo Ren. BB-8 made me forget about R2-D2 altogether. No way this movie deserves less than 7. Clearly the 1/10 reviews are people being paid or who worked on the PT and are bitter. Perhaps they are in the James Cameron camp as well. Seen it three times and I liked it more and more each time. After the prequel abominations (Revenge of the Sith was good), I welcome the similarities between ANH and TFA. Critically speaking, it's right up there with ESB. I'd probably rank them ESB, TFA, ANH, ROTS and ROTJ.Nothing like old star wars, better or worse, you decide I really enjoyed it, i went to see it in a local cinema having had mixed reviews so i didn't go in there with high expectations. The film is so much better than what i had been told from my friends. Don't go in there expecting it to be like any other Star Wars, its so graphically different can really see how much CGI has really helped sharpen things up. Equally the acting is great. Having heard an interview on a radio station the lead female was cast very late into the production so they not had long to film her into the story line. Well done to the young actors, i look forward to watching them grow. In the whole film start to finish there is no mention of Disney at all but lets not forget that Disney brought us Pirates, Lion King, lots of greats.  Here's to episode 8, cannot wait to see that!!Sure, the story is very similar to the old Star Wars. But it works. 10/10 I really, really liked this movie. I was especially impressed by John Boyega and his character Finn, who added a bit of humor and a sense of doing what is right. The evil order and good chaos from the old Star Wars movies can once again be recognized. The new villain Kylo Ren plays his role very well, although I would have preferred if he kept his mask on to preserve the dark mystery around him. And Harrison Ford does a great job as a cocky Han Solo once again. He doesn't get too old apparently. The movie never got slow in pace, which I liked. In the old Star Wars movies you could watch C3PO adventuring for 20 minutes for example, but in The Force Awakens things are happening constantly until the movie is over.Afterall this is my favourite star wars movie so far I just got home from seeing it. Definitely was a great movie, a great star wars movie. First thing I want to outline, which is not really spoilerific, that there were a few things from the trailers that did not make it to the final cut. Although J.J.'s lens flares did appear (obviously) quite a lot of times, the first thing to praise is the visuals, especially the intro's visual. Also later on, all the various settings were well cured. Surely the force was strong with the direction of this film. Next on, acting of the actors. That was great. Everyone just did the best he/she could, which was fantastic. Now the most important thing in a star wars movie, besides having stunning visual effects (Wich were just really the best in this film) is the story. Many ones hated the prequels for that, and praised the originals for having great stories. Episode VII has definitely both the best story and plot and the best backstory. The 30 years of period after VI got well covered, episode VII has a lot of great elements which expanded the galaxy really well. Definitely old EU fans will see a lot of new things they won't dislike. What homever bothers and bothered me was the music. It's john williams, you can hear it, but sound more like Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull's and harry potter's score. That's strange to be seen on a star wars film. So... overall this was a great film that earns my respect. J.J. Abrams won't be called Jar Jar AbramsMost captivating Star Wars film since the originals! (Minor Spoilers!) This was far the best Star Wars film since A New Hope,and Empire. The performances were captivating, and the story follows the Star Wars lore of family. Folks that do not understand this, and are quick to call it a rehash of the originals, clearly don't understand Star Wars as a whole.  Driver's portray of Kylo Ren was inspiring. His heinous actions were for reasons he thought were just. Driver's scene with Harrison Ford was as powerful as the Luke / Vader moments in the originals.  We were introduced to the powerful, menacing, and mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke. Andy Serkis deserves some sort of award. His voice and motion capture work are incredible. Snoke was flat our eerie, and I cannot wait to see more of him the next chapter.  This was a powerful and moving story with terrific lead and supporting performances, awesome cinematography, and tons of great action and suspense.  I will admit that I went into this with marginal hopes, because by our very nature we have a tendency to compare. Star Wars is headed back in the right direction, and I eagerly await the next chapter in the saga!Top Two In Star Wars Movies I have no idea why there is so much hate on this movie. This is one of my favorite movies ever! This passed the original by a complete landslide. There are three very critical reasons why it is better than the original. 1) Better effects - Obviously the effects are going to surpass the original because of the time difference. 2) Better plot - This one brings a whole new level of greatness. 3) The New Jedi - Not going to say who it is, but I love this person a lot. All in all, I would definitely recommend going to watch this movie.  A+Autistic Reviewers Opinion of This Movie. The Franchise we all know and love is back, and guess what? It's BETTER THAN THE PREQUELS! While it doesn't quite top the originals, it comes so close. The movie is so close to perfection!  While many will complain the lack of screen time each character gets, everything else works out perfect! The new comers John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are near perfection. There were times when they had a few corny and unfunny lines to deliver, which did not work, but the newcomers do the best job. The casting choice in this one is way better than the prequels.  J.J. Abrams does his best to make it like Star Wars and not Star Trek and i think that is what brings this movie to life in so many ways. Everything you knew of the original Star Wars has been brought back to life, and it's as if you are a child again! Sometimes you could never tell what was CGI and what was a costume. The main villain is not only different, but extremely terrifying. I will not spoil anything, but let's just say it was not what you were expecting.  All in all, there are some terrific and emotional, breathtaking moments in this film that will go down in the history of the Star Wars franchise.  All your favourite characters are back, and it's a breath of fresh air! I am giving this 5/5 stars. May the force be with you. -Jay For my review of The Force Awakens, I will indeed not to give away spoilers to ruin the fun and solid return to roots for the franchise but I will say what I loved about TFA. Firstly, forget the prequels that had surfaced a couple of years back and embrace the continuing saga of the Star Wars universe, taking place at least 30 years after the exciting conclusion of The Return of the Jedi. The story introduces new characters for both from the good side (New Republic) and it's foes (Galactic Empire) and brings back the iconic characters from the original trilogy, sharing some awesome scenes of emotion, full scale action set-pieces, development and even setting the tone for the future episodes VIII and IX. The acting from John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Issac, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson and such are all tops, they each give a solid treatment to their roles that enable them to develop further with the plot and set their future roles into the coming episodes. The direction is a solid job well done by J.J. Abrams, who manages to keep not only the original elements of the trilogy but gives a polished refreshing look and tone to the new trilogy that is bound to keep fans and audiences revamp their love for the franchise. Overall, this is the film that will indeed win you over again and again while being labelled as the best instalment of the series to date. Go see it not only once, but multiple times as it's worth the hype and word of mouth. 5/5 - NickYes, it really is that good. This movie does everything right.  Right from the start, I was sucked into the story. There are so many ways this could have gone wrong, and I'm so glad they did it right. I was afraid that perhaps the new characters would not grow on me, but fortunately that wasn't the case. Finn's role is just perfect, plus it allows the movie to give the audience more insight into the structure of the empire, and what being a Storm Trooper is all about. This is the world building I was talking about earlier. The movie answers a lot of questions, even the simple ones. Rey is also a great character, but the exact opposite of Finn. Plus I really enjoyed the way the movie dispels common damsel in distress tropes with her. I think Rey's character makes the Star Wars universe more accessible to a young female audience, and that thought makes me smile a little. The movie does its best to show us that Rey is perfectly fine at saving herself. The opening shot of the original Star Wars had its audience literally ducking in their seats, and thus succeeded at making you feel the oppressive rule of the empire with a mere visual. But The Force Awakens nails that too. Rather than steal those shots, they have new shots to achieve the same thing. A lot of the shots of imperial ships are shot at an angle from below, so they look really big. The special effects in this are also amazing. There is so much use of real sets and practical effects. Tons of creatures are puppets, animatronics, or suit- characters. -Even some of the really big creatures are puppets, I suspect. This makes the world look real. Sure, when it comes to big battle scenes there is also liberal use of CGI. I also really like the way they show the interior of various ships, and show how the technology works. It makes it all feel real. Plot wise, the movie succeeds at making the First Order feel threatening, by showing the cruelty of the empire early on. This is something that the old movies never really succeeded at. They always made the Storm Troopers look like bumbling cannon fodder, -but not so in this movie. They also have some fun with the villain, which is welcome. He isn't just some two dimensional character. Another thing that surprised me, is how they expand on the lore of The Force. We get to see new ways in which the Force can be used, and they focus more on the mystical elements of it, and don't even mention the midichlorians from the prequels. And we get to see the Force being used a lot. If you think about it, Darth Vader didn't use the Force all that much in the original trilogy, and neither did Obi Wan. But in the Force Awakens, we see liberal use of it. If you have children you owe it to them to take them to this movie. I mean it. Take them to this movie right now! They will love you for it! Come on! And if you are still a child at heart, then go see it as well.The greatest Fanfic in Star Wars Universe) This is warm) This feels warm) Like a kid who suddenly got his dream come true - to create his own Star Wars Movie) Onle this kid is an accomplished professional J.J. Abrahms)) Come on guys)) Have you ever wondered what is behind the helm of a Stormtrooper?)  The Star Wars Universe is diverse. Mostly it is very doom-laden, fate and tragedy universe, except for maybe Rebels show... It is somehow difficult to imagine one watching the original trilogy lazying in the sunny afternoon)  So..The Force Awakens is not a fun movie. It's a tribute. Definitely not Lucas' style, but very open to us all..and Daisy Ridley is very convincing and energetic and highly likable) and sexy)  I would really look forward to mives like these exploring the possibilities of the Star Wars Universe) And without the Creator's (George Lucas) hard-pressing weight of fate and tragedy for a change)) This movie is a fresh air a rain in the desert of Tatooine) May it stay the same...well.. who knows..J.J. is not going to direct the next one)Star Wars "The Force Awakens" is 100% In 2012 after hearing about Disney bought Lucasfilm LTD I was among all other fans that were skeptical and scared of the future of the Star Wars franchise. When the teaser 2 trailer was released in June 2015 and after watching the trailer I was so hyped for this film. So after watching the film, Does Star Wars The Force Awakens delivers? The Film does Deliver!! After watching "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" for the third time in one week I have giving my full verdict a 10/10. The Force Awakens brings a bold new chapter in the saga with both old and new faces with the right amount of new energy and charm. The experience being in the theater while watching this film, its so amazing to see the old crew back and the audience were clapping in awe joy. Thank you J.J. Abrams.This is Anti-Star Wars - Boycott After watching every Star Wars and now watching the reboot, The Force Awakens I can say this was a complete disappointment, and the clear proof that how things are being done at Disney: reasonable contacts, speaking gibberish and making the movie-attending public believe they are smarter than they actually are because the they can get a way with a copy/paste script. From the very start of The Force Awakens there was many things that didn't add up, but we let them go because we Star Wars fans. ironically, for such a title, the force is completely absent and snoozing and is almost like some kind of a trick that is everywhere and with everyone and can be picked up and run with. I assume this film was made by a computer cut, copy, paste, reedit process using old scripts and input from a consulting film. The worst films are made by committee. Disney's sabotages to the Star Wars legacy don't make much sense because they own the "franchise" (hate it when Disney employees use this word so corporate), but they have no choice without talent. JJ Abrams keeps ripping off and remaking films and he is an embarrassment. He is just a one-dimensional creation of the bank account, a square lover of power and position who can be compared to a film sith - as always happens with directors who dislike art and tradition and love and caring - who history will ultimately prove wrong in almost everything he does. Things get worse as the film continues starting with the time-lapse, lack of continuity and the one-dimensional so-called acting. While the film initially garnered critical (payola?) acclaim, viewers left in droves and by now it is famously considered an embarrassment par excellence. Those who remain for this film could be bad Robot contractors and of course deriders of Star Wars. The death of Star Wars came in 2015, continued in 2016 and Disney will not stop now, but our giving it cash will.What the Actual F.CK So.... um. Firstly i want my money back. OK let me break down my EXACT feeling through the movie... So it started off with a big nostalgic title STAR WARS EPISODE VII with its summary i felt pretty good, it was nostalgic and classic and i had no complaints or whatsoever and the movie began. it looked promising so i kept watching with high hopes and expectations (Im not gonna put the ACTUAL parts of the movie since i don't wanna give spoilers in case you wanna watch this abomination) and stuff happened droid ran with info of new and huge Death star (So far i was like 'okay i'll overlook that') and the environment was nice and kinda nostalgic but after a little bit i was like 'well this is kinda getting bad' , after a bit more later 'wat?' and really funky stuff started to happen i went 'this is awful, is this an attempt to make a remake or sequel?, either way it failed miserably' and closing down to 'final' act i was like 'please just end it or kill me' and after wards the movie ended and i woke up on my bed... nope sadly no. A more short and accurate version of my opinion would be: It tried to milk the fan base of the old movies, its pretty much a lousy and awful recap of episode IV and V. It tried make people feel see the movie as good by making them feel nostalgic, f.cked up the old characters(In a really dumb Way) and the ending was RIDICULOUS. This movie is just..... No Don't COME NEAR ITBoycott Episode 8 It will be as silly and spoofy and boring as this. The force Awakens is the most ironic title for a movie since White Chicks. Please do not walk into a cinema to be voluntarily pick-pocketed. I want to revert back to my childhood when there were only 3 Star Wars films and they were all beyond great.It shouldn't be called Star Wars! It is rubbish! It is disaster! It shouldn't be called Star Wars! It is rubbish! It is disaster! The story is rubbish! The act is rubbish! The scene is rubbish! The music is rubbish! It completely violate the spirit of Star Wars! Lack of everything a Star Wars movie should have! Completely Disaster!!! I went to look this movie as some supplementary stories of Star Wars, but after the movie I felt like being shot and shot again to the heart!As George Lucas said, "The issue was, ultimately, they looked at the stories and they said, 'We want to make something for the fans.' People don't actually realize it's actually a soap opera and it's all about family problems ‚Äì it's not about spaceships. So they decided they didn't want to use those stories, they decided they were going to do their own thing so I decided, 'Fine.'"So they make a worst ever story out! If you are a true Star Wars fan, please be away from this rubbish movie. It is not a Star Wars movie, it is nothing.I don't want to see anymore true Star Wars fan cry out of movie theater because of betrayal made by J.J.Abrams! Remember! Don't look anymore J.J's Movie. No FORCE there! The FORCE is not with him!A homage that didn't quite hit home. Star Wars: A Force Awakens (Don't. Spoilers.) JJ Abrams pays a silent homage to the death of cinema. A quiet admittance that the school of the old has finally given way to the barren, empty landscape of the new. Lucas based his masterpiece on ground- breaking works of Kurosawa's The Final Fortress. This 'new' trilogy however, boorishly begins by playing to the dying notes of its last installment. Same story- scape but out-of-tune and out-of-date. The film slowly turns its pages of rotting parchment with establishing shots of a broken landscape. Desert. Dry. Barren. Fallen AT-AT walkers. A TIE fighter in pieces. A downed Star Destroyer. No doubt representing the futility of getting anything out of this new story. Poking fun at the rise of numerous celebrities with anything but talent, the story unfolded with faceless, expressionless characters. Young. Unknown. Unfamiliar. In the setting sun of the Jakku desert, one can almost imagine Abram's sillouette in the distance, hands pulling out the empty pocket fabric, bemoaning, 'Look. That's all I've got. Take it and leave.' Once in a while, he'll throw the remeniscing audience a bone. 'Look. Here's your wookie. And there, the millennium falcon. You happy now?' Here goes the conversation with the cousin when the credits rolled: Cousin: He didn't need to go confront him, did he? Me: He didn't. I tell you it's the wife's fault. I tried to conceptualise the story arc after Episode VI, V and IV in 1999. Childish no doubt. Here's how I would do one part of it today. Story would have opened in the Cantina, the new main character trying to cut a deal on a second hand spaceship. Talks failed and as the new guy, street- wise, (like a certain smuggler we were once familiar with) tries to worm his way out of the deal, when none other than that same smuggler appearing with his hairy apprentice and pulls him out of the Mexican stand-off. 'It is MY SHIP!' He bellowed. And the newly formed three stooges blast their way through bounty hunters. There you have it. The Solo Entrƒï. Sure beats suddenly dropping him on the falcon. Alas.. I'm no Abrams. And I'm pretty sure I'm sounding too full of myself here. But I really expected a little more. Just because it worked, it doesn't necessary make it as good by compressing all three parts back into one.(It cannot be a coincidence that this installment consists of the environments present in the original one. Audiences experienced the deserts of Tatooine, the frost of Hoth and the forestry of Endor) It is a fancy idea, I'm not gonna argue with that. But every other attempt to impress feels like one failed CPR after another. When the Empire Struck Back or when the Jedi Returned amongst others, they all followed the same simple story structure. The story held up several plots which are interdependent on the other and one cannot occur without the other happening. It's perfectly alright to repeat, however much more could have been done to intensify the subplots. For example, I would have loved that at a crucial moment, it is Leia who displayed the art of 'this are not the droids you're looking for'. I would also have preferred that audience aren't let in first on the reason why Solo will have a secret solo mission on his own, which is to distract his son. So many could-haves.. but all has beens. It was amazing back then, when one gradually discovered how Lucas mimed the entire Nazi machinery on-screen into science fiction. From the misnomer 'Stormtroopers', to their military structure and uniforms. Now, barely anything in the story is anywhere near inspiring. Hollywood has forgotten how to portray evil much less good. With the reportoire of works that he has had, there's no reason for Abram's sub-standard treatment of this story of old. He didn't even try. But he's done it now, rounding off the last set of the trilogy by making it nothing more then a hodge podge series of stories about father-killers. Either the idiot be him, or he's actually a flexible genius to not have Michael Bay-ed every show he directs. Because if anything, this latest piece of work could be a secret parody directed at the dearth of cinematic imagination and how poor audience expectations actually controls the direction of the Star Wars mythos. He at least effectively used the opening scenes of fallen Republic war machines to signify the detachment of the new series to the original stories many were once familiar with. It's a tough job because we must remember that there are varied segments of audiences. Those that missed all the episodes before, those that experienced the second series but not the first. And those in their 30s and 40s who were there since the genesis. On top of these, what was fascinating before may have fallen short because of what's currently hogging audience's and critics' interests. But regardless of these varied considerations, what is core to the business of cinematic magic shldn't have change. Therefore, I would still consider unforgivable that he has dropped the entire franchise into an abyss of uncertainty. Verdict: 1 out of 5 stars. Nothing remotely redeeming. Mentioned spoilers at the start but I assure you, there's not much more damage I can do from what it has already done to itself.This film and its actors show little sign of the punchiness and grit that is Star Wars Star Wars 2015 was, so I believed, supposed to be the follow up to the first Trilogy that included gritty stars such as Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill. True we did get a glimpse of the old Hans Solo and boy was he great. Not so the new wave of actors invading the Galaxy! When Luke Skywalker learnt to be a Jedi Knight, it took time and patience - and it was worth the wait! Not so the young pretenders! In the space of a short time they were able to become the Superheroes of Time and Space. The best actor, in my opinion - was the rugged, gutsy pilot, Poe Dameron, who only had a bit part in the film. Disappointing all round - including the outcome.a safe re-run of past well-performing brand names given a fresh lick of paint by talentless hacks in the service of corporate greed So I've been doing my damnedest to avoid The Force Awakens but was sufficiently bored today to get sucked into its gravitational field along with just about the entirety of the rest of the western hemisphere, it seems. The new Star Wars cash-in is a terribly dull, unoriginal, empty and uninspiring facsimile of a movie made by shareholder meetings and accountants brunches that I nearly walked out of more than once. There were no Jar-Jars and midichlorians in it, it's true, and we should be thankful for that, but there was nothing new in it to take their place, either: it added nothing whatsoever to the existing universe or overall story, and instead of moving it forward was - as many others have said already - for the most part simply a remake of the first film that started it all. Han and Leia looked frail and doddery and had almost nothing of substance to do - I would be surprised if Carrie Fisher's role required more than a day and a half of shooting, and Harrison Ford was apparently simply told 'look regretful once in awhile' and that was about it for the acting. I saw the film only hours ago and cannot recall even one single line of dialogue from it. None of the much-loved returning characters DID anything to remind you why you loved them in the first place, they were just wheeled onto the set, propped up with sticks and then wheeled back off to the nursing home again afterwards. And the new actors were all bland, characterless and immediately forgettable, with the possible exception of Adam Driver, who starts out very well but like the rest of the cast has nothing to do by the end and his character has become an inexplicably weak shadow of himself by then. The only flickers of enjoyment in the whole sorry affair came from nostalgia: the ruins of an AT-AT, half-covered by sand in the desert; the reappearance of the Millennium Falcon. All the rest was a safe re-run of past well-performing brand names given a fresh lick of paint by talentless hacks in the service of corporate greed, with no surprises and no discernible story requiring telling at the heart of it. I didn't quite feel my childhood was being raped in front of me, but I know it's the last Star Wars film I'll ever pay to see. I guess at least I got that hard-won knowledge out of the experience, but that is all.The Force Awakens: A New Hope Remixed The basic plot of The Force Awakens is heavily borrowed from A New Hope. JJ Abrams introduced new characters that are not really new. Everything in this new world is familiar. Whatever worked with the old Star Wars was copied and rehashed into the greatest hits of The Force Awakens. Rey is essentially the new Luke; Rey is the new comic relief here in place of Chewbacca; Poe, a pilot, is the new Han Solo; BB-8 is a cuter R2-D2. In this new movie, the Death Star is gone, but it was replaced by a bigger one - "The Star Killer". In place of Darth Vader is Kylo Ren. Visually, it is as epic as any Star Wars, but story-wise it is moronic. It is no better than any Avengers movie.Typical JJ Abrams Trash The movie was BADLY written horribly cast and had not only terrible acting but MASSIVE PLOT HOLES. Its simply a crappy remake of the original in Jar Jar Abrams style, he steals another person franchise, rips out elements he wants an then remakes all the other parts BADLY and the hype sells tickets. The problem is that Fanboys are TOO STUPID to stop paying to see CRAP with the SW title on it.The 30 years after trilogy sequels that should never had been made F*ck this Force Awakens ! I really-really love Star Wars universe, whatever many hardcore fans said or criticized about the original or the expanded universe. Although many said that the prequels are bad, they still have a lot of fantastic and magical scenes that enjoyable to watch for me. It feels like George Lucas is still the right person to direct the universe he's made in my opinion, not because he's failed with the prequels or brings the annoying character Jar-Jar Binks to live and Hayden's terrible acting, but if you can see how Abrams repeat the first movie of all, change Luke with Rey, Death Star with Starkiller Base and Yoda with Maz Kanata, Why? to play save and not take risk with this biggest lovable franchise or something about his career or anything else? Main characters building (Rey, Finn and Poe)are bad,especially for Finn, he seems not important at all. Most of the action sequences are not amazed me. The scores are weak, where is John Williams we've known for his memorable scores? I like the memorable imperial march or forbidden love between Padme and Anakin score "across the stars", this movie has generic scores, nothing memorable or ear-catchy. The main villain character is far below Darth Vader. To describes Kylo Ren is " an Emo grown up boy with all of his shits to be a Vader wannabe ". Supreme Leader Snoke (giving it "snoke" name always give me a vision of a snake like Sith lord)looks like an Orc or a mixed creature from Tolkien world with a scar on his face, I always thought he was a superior ancient sith lord that will impressed me in shape and character, but when he appears in holographic big form all I can think is "meh". So much awkward important moments like when Han met his emotionally labile son just to stabbed by him and fall, same feel like when he met Leia, the dialogue or emotion seems clich√©, like there were no deep connection between them before. For me the only characters made this movies works are Han Solo, Chewie and adorable new female droid BB-8. I know the plot seems ridiculous from the background story after title when the iconic main theme played. J.J. Abrams has done to Star Wars what he did to Star Trek, He ruined it. Maybe to many people this is a good starting for a new trilogy , but for me he had destroyed the first opening of the latest and biggest sci-fi franchise of all time, Abrams and Disney should never made this 30 years after sequel.A Soulless Cash Grab What an original, well-made piece of art this is. Isn't it exciting to see brand new Star Wars films being made? I can't wait to see two Star Wars spin off films released every year, just like Marvel are doing. I can't wait to see more female and non-white characters shoved in for the sake of promoting diversity. I can't wait for them to destroy even more of the original canon and replace it with more glaring plot holes. Thank you, modern Hollywood. Thank you for raping my childhood on a pedestal, for all the world to see. P.S. The Rogue One trailer is abysmal. If you watch it between 0:39 and 0:42 it looks like Mary Sue is getting funky with herself.Abrams destroys star wars So disappointed. Can only assume that the previous ratings are based on brain washed fans so happy to hear the anthem and see the yellow writing scroll up the screen that they didn't bother to watch what followed. The aforementioned opening was by far the highlight. 30 mins in and I had to nudge myself to stay awake. 60 mins in I would have walked out in disgust if I didn't think I would offend my wife and daughter who had decided to accompany me on my quest to re-capture my youth. The lack of a story was unbelievable. The main villain is a fluffy bunny next to Vader, Maul or Sidious. What rocket scientist decided that Stormtroopers were no longer clones. I'd be easily convinced that Abrams hadn't even watched the original movies, if it wasn't for the shameful way that every scene from Episode IV had been woefully reproduced. Predictable and not an original scene in the movie. I know you have to watch it, but do yourself a favour and wait till it hits TV.J.J. Abrams ruins another franchise It was a train wreck. Do you people out there really want to see the same plot over and over? The Jedi are MIA. The Galaxy is ruled by an evil empire. They have a huge space station that can destroy planets. Droid with important info gets lost and is found by the heroes. Space station is attacked and destroyed by the rebels. Sound familiar? The dialog was boring and predictable and I didn't care about the characters. If this movie had been made in 1977 instead of the first movie it would have been a total dud. The only surprise was when they killed off Han Solo, the one character I liked. Star Wars is dead, PLEASE let it rest in peace! I will never go to another movie with J.J. Abrams name on it.Poor JJ abrams He works hard for the money, sooo hard for the money, he works hard for the moneeey and still can't get it right!!!!! (all rights to copyright holder Donna Summers) This thing is so bad that they would not even admit that it is a remake. They presented as a new episode. Yes, another orphan on a desert planet with a sewage scrubbing clone soldier who is nothing like his progenitor and is wondering (like us) why he was sent on a raid when there were sewers to clean up back wherever he came from (he was already mixed up looking at photos of his ancestor who looks nothing like him, imagine how confused he is now.. so confused that he rebels against his boss)... And just to make this money sucking abomination so 2015 cool make our black and female (anyone watched Ghostbusters 2016)? Nothing against women or blacks mind you love them all but JJ Abrams go do some community service you are so predictable and untalented. Thanks for ruining Star Wars.  Thanks to JJ Disney Star Wars is now as unhip and uncool as a Donald Drumpf cold sore STD mouth-to-mouth kissI want to cry really bad Spoilers x 100 There are just so many things that I didn't like about this movie. Maybe I am wrong, I would just ask the questions and let you to decide: 1. Why is Poe making a stupid joke after witnessing the dead of a friend/ally? In one moment he is mad about it and gets captured because of it and just seconds later he is like uncle Charlie... 2. How Poe was planning to find the droid in the desert ? 3. Why Poe, Finn and Rey act like besties, hugging and all that love? Every scene between them seems forced!!! 4. Why every major character needs to have a short name - Hann, Luke, Leia, Kylo, Ray, Poe .... 5. How Finn has never before shown signs of insubordination and yet this is his first mission? 6. Where did the blood from the stormtrooper came? He is wearing a full armor and blaster shots should close the wound immediately. 7. How Finn being an unimportant stormtrooper knows so much about the First order. 8. Why is Rey laughing here ass of when first speaks to Finn. 9. How convenient is that: the secret meeting is at the same planet as Rey, the droid finds here, Finn crashes just near enough to find here, Hann and Chewie find them just after leaving the planet and so on and so on...... 10. To be a good sword fighter you need years of practice. Why Finn and Rey can suddenly challenge Kylo in a fight? What are the chances that untrained subject won't cut his arm with a lightsaber? 11. Why stormtroopers can't shoot anyone after years of training and yet Rey is killing tons of them never shooting before? 12. Why is Luke leaving a map about his whereabouts if he goes into hiding? The whole plot is centered around this stupid idea!!! 13. Why this movie is such a cheap 100% copy of New Hope? The resistance, the father-son thing, the droid with secret information, the young protagonist. 1000 words are just not enough for this ... this movie to be reviewed in the way it deserves! Even John Williams is below his perfect level....C'Mon. Are you kidding me? (SPOILERS) Have never written a review before. Feel compelled. The fact that it was a rehash/reboot, or rather a "Greatest Hits" type movie is bad enough. What's worse is the treatment of our HEROES. Luke is hiding and sulking in some part of the galaxy (not even in the movie save for 30 seconds). Thanks Disney. While Han Solo has become some deadbeat dad, failed husband, who has abandoned the good fight and just crawled back to being a smuggler. He redeems himself somewhat only to be killed in a totally worthless way. Princess Leia is basically rendered into nothing as well. Very disappointed with A Force Awakens. Far too many problems to post here and MANY have already expressed them anyway.Remake of Episode IV It would of been nice if it was advertised correctly, as a remake of the original Star Wars film. But I guess they wouldn't of made as much money that way? It's essentially a more child/teen friendly version of A New Hope. It's exactly the same story and character types, but with cheap attempts at humor and instead of a badass bad guy (darth vader) you get a bratty kid who has temper tantrums (kylo ren). It bought nothing new to the table and didn't progress the story in any way. We still have no idea what the main characters have been doing the last 20 years.George Lucas made something for art, imagination and hope Disney bought it from the sell-out (older and richer) Lucas and transforms Disney here into the usual Hollywood dreck riddled and burdened with remakes, reboots, reloads. The sad part about this inferior remake is that all the living actors decided to take the 66% (33% goes to their greedy agents) and show up. Legacy? Integrity? Dignity? Nope, nada zilch none of that. Everyone of them showed up and joined George Lucas in going from legends to money grubbing Hollywood cash grabber. Disney playing the lord of capitalist sith bought loyalty, contributed nothing to the lore of Star Wars and now will use tools JJ Abrams to for years issue crap like this. What is funny is that you read statements like 'Disney confirms there will be three new Star Wars movies.' Really?? Was there ever any doubt that they will milk this until the stone bleeds the last cent for decades to come with Star Wars completely destroyed and irrelevant. And there will be no heroes.Everyone is a sell-out or the typical right-wing corporatist prostitute. RIP Star Wars (1977-1983)Not worth a penny I will have to agree with Lucas. This film without him is like nothing: junk junk junk... Only character that was missing was a Mickey Mouse, and I would had given an extra star for cheering me up, as I was very disappointed ;(. And I cannot agree that this "movie" got almost 9 stars from IMDb. So ridiculous, all will tell all my friends about it. They didn't want to change the franchise, but they did by not letting Director Lucas to "advise" them, like they promised they will do. I guess it is a Funeral, they accidentally killed what I loved for many years. Well i guess it cannot be expected to be the best thing ... forever... very nostalgic...I don't understand what went wrong?Sorry to say, but this was the worst of all the Star Wars movies. What else can I say, FabledGentleman said it best and there is nothing else to add. This movie was the biggest letdown and I am sad that I spent money to be disappointed. The story was terrible with little to no thought devoted to the script. The story line was the same old story, revived from episode 4. No indication as to what happened over the last 30 years. No background info on the characters or who they are. The whole movie seemed to be rushed to the big screen for the sole purpose of making money. I'm sorry, but this is the Star Wars story, it deserves to be one of the best story lines brought to the big screen. Anyone who is connected to this story, needs to bring they "A" game. I really hope the next attempt, encompasses all the Star Wars has become.Another atrocious science fiction/fantasy film. Surprise, surprise, the ultimate fanboy JJ has plagiarized another popular film. Unfortunately the few changes introduced destroy the integrity of the film while nearly nullifying the achievements of the original trilogy's protagonists. To be fair to JJ one of the main problems probably stems from a certain brunette producer who appears to have insisted that the main protagonist should be an embodiment of female perfection who also just happens to be a brunette. Luke in A New Hope is helped and upstaged by several male characters but for some reason the makers of this film appear to have concluded that people would object if that happened to a female protagonist. All the talents of the original protagonists plus C3PO's facility for translating languages appear to be combined in one character. In short she is too good at too many things, too early. And I have a slight suspicion that one character disappeared for half the film in order to ensure that she was not upstaged. As everything has to be bigger and better in this remake the other protagonists abilities are also sometimes increased to ridiculous levels when facing the antagonists . If the original trilogy was the hero's journey the indications appear to be that our new heroes will take a gentle stroll around the park. Even though this franchise is merely science fantasy the inclusion of the death planet plot element was a particularly egregious affront to science and should probably have been dropped anyway in order to focus on the search for Luke. The whole stormtrooper plot thread seems to be a fundamentally bad idea poorly executed. Stormtroopers should ideally function as faceless cannon fodder for our heroes to overcome without unduly raising concerns in the watching audience as to their fate. If our heroes are killing stormtrooper antagonists by the thousands I do not want them to be simultaneously portrayed as brainwashed innocents. Once this one brainwashed stormtrooper has a mysteriously quick change of allegiance he and everyone else is back to merrily mowing all the rest down again. If it isn't a problem for that one ex stormtrooper it most certainly is for this particular member of the audience. Not that you would be able to tell that he was an ex stormtrooper from his subsequent behaviour, no PTSD in this world, he is too busy playing the part of comic relief. As with other JJ films the fast pace of the film seems to be a deliberate attempt to cover for inconsistencies, plot incoherence, plot holes and a shameless reliance on unbelievable coincidences and deus ex machina. The film is also full of wise arses cracking jokes all the time in a way that severely reduces the tension throughout, a particularly noteworthy offending line of dialogue appearing right at the beginning when one of the protagonists confronts the main antagonist. JJ also fully deploys his mystery box and consequently there are numerous plot elements left unexplained by the end of the film. Whether JJ actually knows the answers to any of these unresolved mysteries is also a mystery. One of the plot elements left unexplained concerns the exact relationship between the three main factions. This clunky setup appears to exist only in order to recreate the power dynamics of the original film where the tiny resistance takes on the might of the Empire. The First Order replaces the Empire while the resistance replaces the rebels. Somehow though the First Order is bigger and better/badder than the galaxy spanning Empire as they have managed to build a bigger and better Death Star/Planet. The third faction is conveniently sidelined in order that the filmmakers can concentrate on copying the plots from the original films.  Personally I don't want to see a seventy two year old reduced to reprising the exact same role he played nearly forty years ago, especially when the character development during three films appears to have been reversed for the fourth. As in Indiana Jones he even appears to be wearing the same clothes, maybe the wardrobe department ran out of money after clothing everyone else. Although his presence was the most impactful of the returnees it was still an exercise in empty nostalgia. The shoehorning in of old characters, references and dialogue in order to induce nostalgia in the audience demonstrably effected the overall quality of the film as the script had obviously had to be contorted to breaking point to fit it all in. One of the prime examples being the ridiculous succession of coincidences needed to get the old and new characters together within the same scenes. If it was just new characters bumping into each other in a massive universe that wouldn't be such a problem but the new set bumping into the old set within the confines of this one film makes the universe appear to be smaller than one solar system. JJ then compounds the problem by having characters standing on planets while looking up and watching the destruction of other planets. Did JJ flunk science at school? Is this the revenge of the scientifically illiterate? Answers on a postcard please. And finally, where are all the exciting new worlds and races? Star Trek used to be about boldly going into the unknown but the new films decided to chuck all that rubbish away and concentrate on mindless action, explosions and revenge. Star Wars used to be about new planets, new races, and new adventures. Why bother when you can just get away with rehashing the plots of the original trilogy?The experience according to the previous one was just horrible I had no expectation from this movie and still it managed to be a complete sucker of a movie. Compare it to the last three then this movie is absolutely crap. The last three has such a huge amount of focus put into it but this one had a similar format as before, the story line was from previous movie but just changed slightly. It just ruined the whole feel of star wars. People say that its very good but the truth is that this is a disappointment. No efforts put into graphics. They had a budget of $200 mil but tell you what an avenger movie was more entertaining to me. Harrison ford's acting was awful and so was our dear princess. If the budget was about 50 mil the i would say its probably worth it but $200 mil and this is just an insult.Star Wars: The Profits Awakens Star Wars is one of the most beloved franchises from people of all ages. It started with its beginning roots telling the story of the evil Galactic Empire bent on ruling the galaxy while hindering the progress of the Rebel Alliance, to the backstory of how the Republic was deceived by the Sith who enacted war under the guise of the Trade Federation. This film, however, mocks the genius, the integrity, and the furious action packed thrills that existed in all the other films that preceded it. This film is the perfect example of 21st Century Hollywood capitalizing on a franchise name for pure profits while playing it safe. Disney had its eyes for years on this and knew to take advantage when they got the chance. The Force Awakens felt like a mere reboot than an actual entry into Star Wars series. People loved the original trilogy (which I'm not actually a huge fan of, though I personally still enjoy it anyways), but when the prequels came out the fans bashed it harshly. All blame came out on George Lucas being a terrible Director and Writer. When this was announced, it was thought to be the "saving grace" from Episodes I-III. Unfortunately it was not, and turned out to be worse than the prequels. Let's analyze this movie: Director and Writing: J.J Abrams, or Jar Jar Abrams, had some good movies before this such as Super 8 and Star Trek, but being handed down the mantle of Star Wars was not his strongest suit. If I wanted to watch a film about flashy lens flares and camera shake with sudden focus zoom following unconvincing CGI spaceships flying through space, I would stick to Star Trek. What really disappointed me was the "playing it safe" rule by telling a story that was pretty much the same thing from Episode IV, only this time it's bigger and/or has a different name. Why didn't they just put Rey on Tatooine instead of a planet that is called Jakuu which pretty much looked the same? I don't know maybe because the Director and Writers got lazy and decided it didn't need to be authentic. Same goes for bringing a oppressive regime to the picture, The First Order, which was born from the defeat of the Empire. Guys, the Empire was finished and done for, so there is no reason to doing a throwback at the Original Trilogy. The jokes in this film are childish and do not blend in with the situations at hand. It is written to entertain children who couldn't understand the babbling of space politics in the other films. Not one time did I feel that there was an actual threat at hand, it felt like a silly Marvel themed space journey like Guardians of the Galaxy. Characters: I do have to hand it to JJ that the acting and character development was put forth quite well, except the fact that The Force Awakens traded this off for plot convenience. Rey, a lonely farm girl left of Jakku, seemed to know how to do everything from fixing machines, piloting space ships, using Force Powers, and engaging the main villain in light saber combat with no training whatsoever. What no faults at all? Hmm that characterization is very uninteresting and boring to say the least. Finn, and let's be honest, was tossed in to add diversity to the main characters. He is cowardly, obnoxious, and is there to save the girl even if she can already save herself. Poe Dameron and Finn's relationship was the only thing that seemed morally self-sub-staining (although rushed a bit) since Poe faced execution and Finn was able to escape the First Order while developing a friendship in the midst of danger. Kylo Ren was not convincing as a villain and was a heaping balloon of hot gas ready to explode when something did not go his way. The casting of this character was flawed and was more whinny than Anakin was in the prequel trilogy.  Music Score and Sound Design: If I'm not getting any of the aforementioned components above, then you are going to get the music down right? Wrong. John Williams knows how to score Star Wars and has been doing it for Lucas for over 30+ years. This time around, JJ sighed and said "okay fine I won't use Michael, I'll get John to do it." The pitch and tones are all off in this movie and have no memorable tunes in any form like Episode I did with "Duel of Fates" or the "Empire March" in Episode V. I felt the energy of Star Wars was not present in the Force Awakens much to many disappointed fans. Abrams himself did not even research the previous sound effects in any of the other movies and made every object in the film feel weak, foreign, and pathetic like the music.  Visual Effects: Nice use of practical effects on their part I won't lie about that. But other than that, it was still unconvincing. The space ships and fighters looked completely unreal with the preferred use of going absolutely CGI with every film production nowadays. All the other films used miniatures combined with practical effects like pyrotechnics and computer effects such as photo realistic rendering to get a real looking result printed onto film strips for the first entry in the prequels (yeah that was quite an ingenious method for visuals when film strips were still being used). In this case it was either one or the other, no mixing allowed.  Overall I am completely disappointed and felt no real external threat to this epic space tale. There didn't seem to be any continuity to the series and as stated before, felt more like a reboot than a sequel. Hopefully the other entries will try to fix the problems this movie had. If they don't, then I'm afraid the sequel trilogy will become the new prequels.How could they fail so miserably I saw this now as a fan of the series ( which would have been even worse),but as a movie goer who enjoyed some of the prequels and in general enjoys this sort of movies. But,boy was I in for a surprise... There is just no story or character development in this movie,there also isn't a single likable character even. The bad guy- the sith Lord - is just pathetic- he never even took part in a decent fight , until the very end when he fought some regular Joe who almost kicked his ass,although he didn't have the force and had touched a light saber once before, and was then killed by some girl ,who was so strong with the force that didn't need any kind of training at all( I remember in the other movies jedies had to train for years ,some with yoda even). The girls strong with the force - she didn't even know she had it 5 mins earlier, and now she is a master ?!?! How did the empire/first order even get to rule the universe, they troops can't hit anything when their lives depend on it,2 main character without any experience destroy swarms of them. Also - when defending the death star planet thing, the resistance sent like 6 ships,the bad guys sent ALL SQUADRONS, and they couldn't deal with 6-8 x- wing fighters ? Really ? Wtf...just wtf... All those defensive turrets couldn't hit anything either- who built and engineered them,really..it is just insulting to anyone's intelligence to watch that, even if they know it is just for pure entertainment. It is not entertaining, it is annoying and frustrating. I'm even too frustrated to finish this review. Don't watch it,it is horrible. I don't know how someone gets paid to make such a bad movie,if I were that bad at my job i'd be fired.
More marshmallow than Martian! The crew of an American base on Mars are forced to make an emergency departure leaving one crew-member behind presumed dead. But he is alive! Can the stranded astronaut find a way of communicating his plight to those on Earth and survive while he awaits rescue?  A fairly standard 'castaway' plot but one which offers many dramatic possibilities. Unfortunately few of these are realised in this pedestrian movie which fails to generate any significant dramatic tension. This is partly because the characterisation is thin but also because the challenges the stranded astronaut faces seem to be so easily overcome. Starvation? Grow potatoes. Punctured space-helmet? Sticky tape. Mars rover vehicle lacking power? Wire up a few solar cells. Communications equipment destroyed? Motor over to a handy Mars lander. We never sense that the 'Martian' (Matt Damon) is in a desperate, mind- and body-sapping struggle against the odds (conveniently he is a botanist). Damon effectively portrays the 'Martian' as a likable guy but the problem is how to fill the two hours of the movie that remain after he is stranded? When a character is alone and unable to communicate it needs something exceptional to keep us glued to the screen. Maybe what's going on back home will do it. Not really because the cast of characters there are verging on cardboard cut-outs. The returning crew? Likewise. And the script is written on the assumption that the audience is a little dumb, e.g. A: It will be 500 Sols (Martian days) before we can rescue him. B: But his food will run out in 300 sols. C: So he'll die before we get there. Indeed! And so may we.  The movie has some good FX and the Martian landscape looks convincing. But there's nothing exceptional here to compensate for the lack of an effectively told story. In essence this is an American feel-good fantasy film, celebrating ideals of technical omnipotence, racial harmony, gender equality and international collaboration (with those cool Chinese guys and gals). If only it were so. No wonder the credits rolled to the tune of The O' Jays singing 'Love Train'. School-kids will probably join in! But, to quote Sam Goldwyn, 'Include me out!' (Viewed at the Odeon, Warrington, 06 October 2015)This movie is really NOT good! Here's why. It's so frustrating when so many people like and praise a movie that really doesn't deserve it. The Martian is such a movie. I had such high hopes for it after all the hype, and after reading reviews by smart critics I usually agree with, but it was such a disappointment. Here's why:  Plausibility. Just like Gravity, there are so many non-sensical depictions of the physics of space travel, it makes my head hurt, and I'm not even a physicist. The characters and their actions are pretty implausible too, starting with Damon's chipper attitude about being left alone on a planet 100 million miles from Earth, but certainly not ending there. After realizing he is alone and will be for so long that he will run out of food, he gets the brilliant idea to try to grow his own, which we are supposed to take as a mark of his plucky brilliance. But he's a botanist! What would a botanist be doing on a space mission *except* studying how things grow? And then when an accident causes all his potato plants to die, the brains at NASA (who can't believe he figured a way to grow potatoes in the first place) instantly conclude (and tell us) that since the accident froze all the bacteria in the soil, he won't be able to grow any more. Why not? He still has potatoes to eat, and he still, presumably, shits occasionally, so he has all the ingredients he used the first time. Ugh! My brain hurts!  Writing. The script seems written more by market researchers than a screenwriter. Corny little one-liners ("My balls are frozen!") appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience, and the relentlessly happy tone makes being stranded on Mars seem like a big party, complete with disco music (literally). And the dialog!! There's a moment when Jeff Daniels, the head of NASA (whom it is hard to imagine has ever ever taken a science class or piloted anything) talks to the heads of the Chinese Space agency who offer (presumedly--we only hear his end of the conversation) to lend one of their ships to the rescue effort. He says, "Mmm Hmm. Okay. I see. Thank you." (That's what a discussion about loaning spacecraft between two space agencies sounds like.) Then he hangs up the phone, clenches his fists, and says, "Yes!" It's like Homer Simpson finding out there is still one donut left. That someone wrote that line is astounding. That the director and actor saw fit to actually shoot it is bewildering. That it survived the editing process and made it into the final cut--well, there should be an investigation.  Pacing. It's a movie about being stranded on Mars for months and months. Why does it feel like a comedy by Woody Allen or Edgar Wright? There is never a pause, never a prolonged quiet moment that might begin to capture something of the unbelievable space and loneliness this movie is supposed to be about. Instead, it is a constant rapid fire of dialog and action. Even the scenes where he is communicating with Earth via text happens faster than I usually get with my iPhone and 4G. (NASA technicians mention, at one point, that there is a 25 minute delay between all communications, but the filmmakers hope we forget this two minutes later when all the subsequent conversations happen instantly). Then there is the rest of the crew and their additional unplanned two years of extra time stuck in the spaceship, going all the way BACK to Mars to pick up what they left there. If I have to run back home to get something I forgot, the trip always seems infuriatingly long. But not these cheery space travelers! Another two years in space! No problem! And it takes only two minutes of screen time. Piece of cake!  AGH! What a frustrating experience. If you want a sugar-coated popcorn movie that will make you think that if being on stranded on Mars isn't really so bad, why complain about our petty little problems here on Earth? then this movie might be for you. It does for being stranded in space what The Shawshank Redemption does for being in prison. It tries to tell us that it's really not THAT bad after all. It's such a lie, and such a disappointment, all the more so because there are so many serious issues and exciting psychological and scientific aspects about space that could have been explored here.Expected more I am a bit of nerd of this kind of realistic science fiction movies and therefore I had high expectations of this movie. I regret to say I was disappointed. The movie tells the story of how the main character struggles to survive on Mars and how the space agencies work to get them back. But I was missing the emotions, the human touch. The main character never displays any signs of loneliness, despair or fear. He is more like "oh, looks like I'm stuck on Mars, let's grow potatoes". He makes a one- off reference to his parents in an electronic communication, but nowhere in the movie is it made clear what his main drive is to want to return to Earth. It appears as nothing ties him there. Maybe the directors wanted to avoid the clich√© of the eight months pregnant and terminally ill wife eagerly awaiting her husband's return from a dangerous mission, but even a clich√© had been better than nothing. His character is also too flat. The only character trait that is highlighted slightly in the movie is that he may be a bit too smug about himself. Nothing else to make me identify or sympathize with him. To be honest, I couldn't have cared less if he had not survived. The Mars landscape is beautifully rendered en very credible with dust clouds and all. This is the main attraction of the movie. The main problem that there is nothing novel about this movie. There have been better movies for every aspect of the film: Human aspect/psychology of being marooned in a strange place: Cast Away did it so much better; set in space: Matt Damon's role in Interstellar was more credible than his performance here. Space action scenes: Gravity had me on the edge of my seat Ground control scenes: Apollo 13 already set the standard In summary, the movie is a beautiful, but hollow shell.Not a Ridley Scott Classic I can't really believe that I just finished watching a Ridley Scott science fiction movie and feeling this low, this one never felt like anywhere close to any of his classics. This is just nothing but a typical Hollywood s***. Matt did a poor performance as a character who is caught in a life and death situation. He is not scared or emotional but instead he keeps throwing Hollywood typical punch dialogues on your face like an Avenger hero when you are expecting Science. A make-up artist or a sound engineer from the set of "Big bang theory" would have written better science script and dialogues. For me there are plenty of "WTF" or "Seriously?" moments in this movie and I wonder what happened to one of the favorite directors of all time. Also repetitive high five/triumph scenes where we don't feel anything. To brief: Drag, bad drama, insensitive emotional scenes, poor acting, very less science, predictable and not at all funny punch dialogues! Just YIFY it, don't buy!Utter piece of trash Boy, I haven't hated a movie this much in a long time. I actually just joined IMDb (I have been a long term viewer) in order to vent this out of my system, and to express my amazement that this terrible, vapid, clich√© movie won a Golden Globe and is nominated for the Oscar best movie of the year. What the heck is going on? Are Aliens sucking the brain matter out of us little by little so that we actually think this tripe is not only good, but great?  A script a high schooler could have written, bad acting, terrible dialogue, one dimensional characters you don't care about, bad disco music, overly politically correct casting, mistakes in basic "science", stupid hap-hap-happy ending where everyone in the world (literally) is jumping, smiling and hugging each other, I could go on and on. This movie was so bad we actually kept watching it, like the morbid curiosity of looking at an auto accident.  My favorite line of the movie was when Jeff Daniels said that the Matt Damon character would be fine with his supplies "as long as nothing goes wrong". I looked at my husband and said sarcastically "Gee, I wonder if something is going to go wrong", and wouldn't you know it, in the very next scene it does.  We have sworn off any future Ridley Scott movies, for good. He is obviously in cahoots with the Aliens sucking out all our brain matter.Shallow, empty I was waiting for this movie for a few weeks and was greatly disappointed when I finally watched it. It doesn't matter if the number of potatoes to survive is accurate, if you are using toxic rocket fuel to make water, you do not feel lonely and isolated, and you are not worried about oxygen - you are just having fun - isolated for 300-500 days without anyone or anything else around - the guy seems pretty comfortable and not worried. Impossible to connect with characters. Too many stereotypes. Blatant sales and marketing, actor and story picks for the sake of selling more tickets. I hope I will save my money and time, next movie like this comes out.Were my expectations too high? I wish I liked this movie more like a lot of moviegoers who are giving it good to even great reviews, but I left the theater with a bitter taste in my mouth I had to write this review to reconcile my feelings. Imagine a movie that takes from the glory of Gravity, Cast Away and Apollo 13 which also tries to be as hilarious and groovy as Guardians of The Galaxy at times but fails? You've got The Martian. The first 1/3 of the movie was quite engaging: An astronaut on Mars expedition team gets left behind after a huge storm because he was assumed dead. But he was alive and we watch him try and utilize every cell of his brains and science savvy to survive until help comes. But once he gets out of initial danger things get all too predictable and over-wrought. Couple of annoyances: 141 mins. About 30 mins too long for the storyline. There were too many mentions of Disco music the commander of the mission left behind to ill effect, unconvincing supporting characters on the Earth who seem to be just reciting a script, and some characters the movie shouldn't have had whatsoever (such as Kristen Wiig).  Did Matt Damon do a good job ? I thought so until they showed a body double that didn't even resemble him and from there nothing he did was believable unfortunately. Had Damon actually lost weight without using a body double, I might have gotten more into the movie. But then again, he is no Christian Bale. So I wasn't expecting it but a little weight loss would have made him more convincing.  A few good acting jobs came from Michael Pena and Benedict Wong whose characters added to the storytelling instead of subtracting it in the midst of too many unnecessary characters reciting an already weak script.A movie written by frat-boys I don't usually like to give movie reviews - but it was a hot weekend and I figured maybe I'd venture out and see what the culture had to offer. So just how bad was "The Martian?" So bad that after an hour I realized I would rather be back in the sweltering 97 degree heat than sitting in an air conditioned theater listening to anymore inane dialog (lines like "F**k you Mars!" and "I'm going to science the S**T out of it!") In fact it would appear that a prerequisite for going into the space program is at least six months of doing stand up. (BAD stand up.) Why does everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) in the movie sound like one of those guys on "The Big Bang Theory?" Snarky and idiotic and always cracking wise. Also: Why did every character, while typing, READ what he's typing out loud? Has anyone ever done this EVER? And what was with all the expository dialog, (the whole script was expository as far as I'm concerned) Throughout the movie Matt Damon talks into a video camera, making a diary and yet he only says things that everyone who would potentially WATCH the video would of course already know, things like: "Oh yeah, did I tell you? I'm a botanist." It's clear he was attempting to speak directly to the viewer and NOT the imaginary audience in the movie itself. This is the laziest kind of writing there is. They don't know how to deliver plot anymore except to dump bowling balls of ham fisted information in your lap; telling you things you've already figured out in the most obvious way possible. That meant that there was absolutely ZERO tension. It was like reading an instruction manual for a microwave oven. "How do I grow potatoes? Oh look there's some poo." (cue the laugh track) And Ridley Scott's direction was as slack as an industrial film. False stakes, false resolutions, false falseness. Now,I know I only managed to make it through the first hour or so; maybe it got really good after that, but I was starting to feel my brain cells beginning to atrophy so it was from a sense of self- preservation that I skedaddled out of there when I did. (And don't get me started on the disco songs and requisite jokes about 'bad musical taste.' It was just more target-market reconstituted nostalgia-bait.) If there is a more unoriginal, un-involving, unbelievable waste of time out there, I haven't seen it. So of course: Line up the Oscars!What do you get when political correctness takes precedent over good movie making? (If telling you why this move is terrible qualifies as a spoiler then beware) This movie can be summed up with one word... vapid. As if Matt Damon's inherently vapid acting weren't bad enough, the makers of this film were so overtly focused on presenting an idyllic reality where no character behaves in any offensive way, to anybody, they produced an un-suspenseful, uninteresting, boring, vapid turd of a story. They fall over themselves to be so certain that no minority demographic is stereotyped that all characters have the sane vapid personality. And in what seems to be some sort of perverse effort to recompense reality, a very transparent hierarchy is followed to be certain that: the Black people are the most clever; the Hispanic people are next most clever; the Asian people are next most clever(carefully not portrayed as exceptionally smart), and of course the women are more clever than the men. Of course the only flawed demographic were older white male authority figures. To me this liberal, philosophical portrayal of what an ideal reality is reveals that they are the true bigots, the haters. They hate the differences that make people interesting. Ethnicity, femininity / masculinity, and their different traits should be loved and celebrated, not shamed, muted, or eliminated. It is the interaction of those differences that create an interesting story, not a vapid one.Matt, you're not making this easy. This tedious family adventure film is the latest contribution to the popular and well established 'Where Are We Rescuing Matt H. Damon From This Week?' genre. I like Matt H. Damon, I really do. But he's been making it very difficult recently, and this 2+ hour marathon just doesn't help. Damon plays an astronaut accidentally marooned on Mars by a storm that literally could not happen because Mars lacks the necessary atmospheric conditions, where he must somehow survive with nothing but an unlimited supply of electricity, an unlimited supply of water, an entirely self- sufficient artificial habitat, half a dozen spare space suits, multiple land vehicles and probes (all in perfect working order), food supplies intended for half a dozen people, and a large quantity of magical potato seedlings that grow to maturity in just a few days despite a complete absence of soil nutrients. Since the first act establishes that Damon is so well set up he doesn't actually need rescuing, Ridley Scott fabricates a second act 'emergency' in a vain attempt to raise tension (it doesn't). Damon keeps in contact with Earth via a magical transmission technology that provides full HD streaming with no latency whatsoever, allowing him to have real time conversations with NASA headquarters, where everyone does and says whatever they want because there is no chain of command even though it's ostensibly run by Jeff Daniels (played by Jeff Daniels). His fellow astronauts remain hovering above Mars, beaming their own HD stream to NASA by the use of a magical camera that automatically homes in on Damon regardless of where he is on the planet. NASA builds a brand new rocket from scratch in less than 14 days so they can send Damon a fresh load of unlimited supplies. It explodes immediately after takeoff because Ridley Scott still has another hour to fill. Meanwhile Damon accidentally blows up his potatoes. NASA's lone Chinese employee suddenly remembers that his uncle has a private rocket he's never got around to using, so they phone China and ask if NASA can borrow it. The uncle agrees so the Chinese government sends it into space immediately, where it is instead caught by Damon's astronaut colleagues, who nick all the supplies. Meanwhile Damon is travelling to the other side of the planet, where he intends to escape using a previously unsuspected bonus rocket that just happens to be lying around the place in perfect working order.  Damon can't carry his unlimited supply of water and only has enough room in his vehicle for a few sandwiches, but by a remarkable stroke of luck it turns out that his body is capable of indefinite peak physical performance despite minimal hydration and a complete lack of nutrition, so that's OK. Also it turns out that the gravity on Mars is exactly the same as Earth's, so he hasn't lost any muscle tone. Damon arrives at the bonus rocket and is told by NASA that it's actually too heavy to lift off the planet despite being designed for that exact purpose (???) The only solution is to remove the nose of the rocket, which is actually easier than it sounds because the entire spacecraft is made of Lego and can be easily disassembled by a single undernourished man with no tools. With the nose of the rocket removed, Damon risks being killed by the extreme physical pressure generated by takeoff. NASA points out that a simple tarpaulin is strong enough to protect him, so he finds a spare one from... somewhere... and straps it on. Damon's fellow astronauts pair their ship with his rocket using Bluetooth, and take over the controls. Damon is almost crushed to a pulp as the rocket leaves Mars, because it turns out that tarpaulin isn't as strong as industrial steel after all. Somebody on the astronauts' ship blows something up because of reasons, and this somehow makes it easier for one of them to rescue Damon, who has jumped out of his rocket and is now flying towards their ship with the aid of a hole in the finger of his space suit and an unlimited supply of pressurised oxygen. NASA is helpfully streaming this heroic rescue to the entire planet using their magical realtime HD stream, because of course they are. Damon and his fellow astronauts arrive home safely just a few hours later, and Damon is rewarded with a free pair of glasses. Henceforth, everyone must call him 'Doctor.' Because doctors have glasses. I rate The Martian at 13.32 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a mediocre 4/10 on IMDb.another pathetic movie of Ridiculous Scott because I care about the future, I looked forward to this movie. But while i watched it, it was a struggle to make it to the end. I'm very disappointed. Easily i blame the director, but there is a bigger production team who failed. They created a film of shallow, lame, clich√© stereotypes with bad developed characters. It's all about the hero. It's not about "Matt Damon in his best role". When he's suppose to be funny, it's the worst. Jessica Chastain was brilliant in Interstellar, so now she lights up another successful chapter of imaginary human spaceflight ? Sorry, I much more think of a massive loss of image. If you wish to make future NASA look smart, cute and sexy, do not pick Jeff Daniels as it's director ! Every time 'Teddy' shows up, I expected Jim Carrey dancing to the disco sound. It wasn't even funny once to blame Lewis for her taste of music, and it wasn't funny to blame her again and again.  Please, Mister Scott, if you grab one more time into the box of stereotypes and transform actors like Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and Michael Pe√±a into fools: retire ! Thank you. P. S. Hold on, you didn't fail on Mackenzie Davis, she made NASA look cute.Unintentionally funny, otherwise OMG awful! I watched this movie with a friend who has no technical background, and she pronounced it good. I should note that my friend is Canadian, and with the possible exception of Neil Young, Canadians are an innately polite people. Meanwhile, being American, I was laughing internally until I spotted.  I also note that I knew the author of the book (when he was a kid) through a workplace and personal friendship with his father. Andy Weir is an incredibly gifted science geek, as is his dad. I therefore know that none of the gross scientific transgressions in the film can be blamed on his ignorance. Andy openly admits to willfully ignoring a few things like the thin Martian atmosphere in the interest of moving the story forward. He correctly understood the impatience of miseducated Americans with annoyances such as basic laws of physics. IOW, he took the movie money and ran, like the smart kid I know him to be.  So I would say that any idiotic disregard of science on screen‚Äîthe use of Visqueen and duct tape to secure a 6 foot hole vacated by (richly ironic) a blown hatch cover against a 50,000 pound pressure gradient, for example‚Äîresulted either from production or directorial indifference. The list of anti-Newtonian horrors goes on, and gets funnier, particularly when Matt Damon punctures his space glove and uses the escaping oxygen to propel himself toward his rescuer. Next, I was half expecting the crew of the rescuing spacecraft to line up, bend over, and torch off an ensemble fart to correct a course deviation. In any case, this movie was not intended to portray a real human battle against nature, as was so wonderfully chronicled in Apollo 13. Rather, The Martian was intended to make money by playing on current themes of political correctness and the warm fuzzies of international cooperation, framed by the awesomeness of space. It fails spectacularly even at this wretched goal‚Äînot at making money, you understand, but the furtherance of World Peace‚Äîplacing its bets on star power, flaccid dialogue, dumbass jokes and cheap CGI effects instead of a solid script, good acting and a credible stab at realism. Jeff Daniels as the director of NASA? My God... Watch this movie only if you're looking for something to distract you from doing something more useful, such as expressing the dog's impacted anal glands. Higher emotional content can be found by chopping up an onion.The worst thing about this movie Spoilers below.  The worst thing about about this movie was that everything is so hard to believe because it's such nonsense. It doesn't follow basic physic laws. It doesn't take much to get me invested in a movie as a viewer, but this just goes too far. The absolute worst flaw is not even all the fake science, nor I'd it the overuse of disco music or the fact that the astronaut doesn't really get desperate and only makes cheesy jokes... No, it's the fact that China's space program has some secret spaceship which they want to reveal and give up for the eyes of the world to save one unknown American dude. That just doesn't make any sense. First of all, China could care less, also, why give up a rocket on which you've been apparently working in secret, just to send food up to space? And if all this would happen for some strange reason... America responds with 'ok. I see. Thank you'. Hangs up and goes ' yessssssss.' Idiotic.NASA promotes the rape of science for tax-payer money. I had low expectations of this film, and not to my surprise, my expectations where more then fulfilled. After watching this terrible movie, I looked up the reviews on the Internet and was disappointed that so many reviews of sites and movie-critics where so positive. It felt like I was truly alone on this world. For me, the movie was sh*t, but everyone thinks it was great. Wat is wrong with me. But today, I started reading the reviews of some fellow IMDb- reviewers, and finally I see what is wrong. Only an intelligent person would perceive this movie as cr*p, but since most people are morons, that explains all the positive reviews. I can only perceive this waste of pellicule as a promotion-movie for NASA. They probably want to gear up to get more tax-payer money for their upcoming research to get people to Mars. Believe me, this will be money wasted. People will never walk on Mars, seeing the current situation on this planet. The movie was a travesty, where science and doing the math was used as a continuous red line to explain everything. I really didn't see any math or science in this movie. It was more like a lotto contestant who won every game, against all odds. The astronaut was a botanist. WHAT??? That was the easy part. Planting some potato's in Mars-dust, and fertilize them with sh*t, in a dark environment does not give you a full 100% harvest of potato-plants. Believe me, I have done the math, in earth soil. He was also a doctor, an electronics engineer, a chemist, a programmer, a mechanic, a psychologist and what what more. An astronaut for me, should be a civil engineer, with a specialization in whatever field in science, but certainly NOT a botanist. Unbelievable. And where did he get all of his oxygen? After getting his helmet ruptured and taping it off, he was down to 10% oxygen, but after a few seconds all was back to normal. Heh? If you want more discrepancies, read some more reviews with low stars. This film is full of it. Ridiculous Scott, stop making more movies, you seem to suffer of the self-delusion that you are a Sci-Fi director. Nuff said.Whatever happened to good space movies? Underwhelming and boring movie, can't understand how it gets so much acclaim and good reviews in general. The theme of man overcoming challenges through "science" sprinkled with disco music here and there to awaken viewers along the way and raise their spirits felt clich√© and didn't make it for me. The film just felt somewhat void and foreseeable. I think it lacked suspense and if I may "planetary or space awesomeness", but of course that is not the mood the film aims at, so you can blame me for judging it from my expectations rather than than considering the movie in itself. However, to me it seems almost like a movie about Mars had to be made and this is what we got. You would expect something special coming from Ridley Scott, or maybe not after the disappointment of Prometheus (for me that film deflated at about the equator and contained some odd script and dialogue nonsense) What happened to old good space movies?Thrilling Sci-Fi Survival Adaptation In an era where science-fiction survival tales are becoming a popular occurrence - with 'Interstellar' last year, and 'Gravity' the year before - writer Andy Weir and sci-fi connoisseur Ridley Scott team up to craft a complex tale that is carried by a single character, that character being Mark Watney, played fantastically by Matt Damon (Hollywood's biggest calamity, who requires being rescued... again). As the film tees off, we are instantly given a first-person view of the dangers of Mars and the fight for survival each astronaut is living out each day on the planet's surface, that is until their emergency evacuation - but nope, even Damon couldn't do that right. Abandoned upon the desolate surface of Mars after being presumed dead by his crew, Damon must do all he can to endure the martian environment. One huge thing I admire about this film's plot, is that it doesn't care about the intellectual level of its audience, as the quote above states so well: it'll science the s**t out of them. It's such a complex and well-executed premise that on paper seems nothing more than a impossible feat to pull off. Technically this film is stunning, the cinematography, the CGI, the production design, all utterly gorgeous, and according to the Golden Globes, it's one of the best comedies of recent years too... yeah, sure. Admittedly the tongue-in-cheek humour does add a more fresh appeal to the film, making it a little more unique than previous sci-fi adventures, it piles on layers of thrills, emotional value and complex character development to create one of the finest science fiction films of recent years.Were all the scientists on a day off when this script was written? Wow this was a bad one, I thought Interstellar was painful but this was even worse (I know hard to believe!) My favourite part in the whole movie was when Matt points out that an explosion which occurred in a particular room during an experiment he was conducting was due to (you'll love this!) him exhaling too much oxygen into the room! Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure we exhale CO2 and inhale O2. I think even a fifth grader would be able to tell me that. I nearly cried with laughter when I heard him say that line and how he kept a straight face is beyond me, unless he thinks its true of course. This was just the beginning of the lack of believable science in this movie and it was so painful to watch after more and more random unbelievable events started popping up. His one line killed the movie for me, from that point on I was looking for more "errors" and they just kept on coming. Anyway to cover the opening sequence with how poor Matt ends up left on Mars to die, well there's a big storm that no one seems coming, they all rush to their landing vehicle to hot tail it back up to their orbiting mothership. Matt gets a whack in the gut with something (which we later find out pierced his suit completely but yet somehow the suit manages to stay pressurised with a hole in it) and decides to pass out. The rest of the crew fly back up to the mothership and, get this, immediately set course for home! They don't stay in orbit for say another 24 hours and recover Matt's body they just leg it back home asap. Odd I thought for a NASA mission to just abandon him and not say bring the body back for his family to bury. When poor Matt wakes up he finds all the communications are down and all his friends gone. And by communications I mean the one satellite dish that was stuck to the habitat roof has blown down in the storm and been completely demolished, but not one of the solar panels outside is damaged, just a bit sandy. Seeing how comms back to Earth would be one of the critical systems would there not be 3 or 4 other methods of calling home, redundancies in case of a disaster? NASA didn't see the point in having any of those backups on this mission to Mars, what could possibly go wrong? Another good one is when he is told to drill and cut a whole in the roof of a perfectly airtight rover and sticky tape a big plastic balloon to the top of it. No reason is given for this yet it happens, I think it's so he can take some more plastic painting sheets with him but I cant be certain. Also wouldn't this drilling and cutting a big hole compromise the pressurisation integrity rendering the vehicle unsafe to drive around in without a space suite on, oh but not for Matt, he happily drives around Mars with no suit on at all with his new plastic sticky taped sunroof fitted trying to work out how far he can get on his batteries while whinging about how he'll never make it to the RV due to lack of power all the while singing along to the stereo with more flood lights turned on than at a football stadium. Um turn some crap off Matt that'll save you some juice. Again another scene in the movie, an airlock somehow gets blown to bits and a big gaping whole is left in the side of the habitat Matt lives in. The solution, a big piece of plastic sheet and more sticky tape, he then repressurises the habitat and somehow his sticky taped plastic painting sheet is able to hold up fine, outside there are wild storms going on (which are visible through a few of the more believable looking pressurised windows) raging away and not one single piece of debris punches through his plastic painting drop sheet or does any damage to his rover or solar panels. The mission to get him home is to send back the craft which ran away and left him in the beginning. NASA didn't tell the crew of the ship for months that he was still alive as they didn't want to hurt their feelings! So the plan to get him back is drive the mothership all the way back to Earth, do some gravity sling shot thing around Earth (sounds like Apollo 13?) rendezvous with a supplies pod (food and movies onboard probably) and fly all the way back to Mars and pick him up as he fires himself into space from a lander (after stripping out all the gear inside, removing the roof and covering it with another plastic painting sheet held on with sticky tape to save weight) already there for the next disastrous mission to Mars NASA has already cooked up. For me this movie just went too far, way beyond what any normal person with a even a tiny grasp of science can cope with. I cannot believe Ridley, NASA and JPL were happy to have their names mentioned let alone their relevant ground breaking departments portrayed with such a lack of any real science. I know it's a SciFi movie but you have to get the basics right and have some kind of explanation for the viewer to be able to buy into the ludicrous things which take place in the movie. Otherwise it just becomes a complete bore to watch and the viewer spends their time looking for more flaws. My opinion, save yourself the money, stay home, get a pizza in &amp; watch Blade Runner on BluRay again :-)Insulting Do not trust any review above 2 stars. I think such users are payed reviewers. I went to watch this "movie" not expecting much, but what i get was a total frustration.  I'd like to get a refund for the ticked i payed because i felt cheated. The movie is insulting to human intelligence. Totally pointless, superficial and from a scientific point of view, is an insult to every scientist. In addition i hope the NASA will call the production to a courtyard for how they have been represented in the movie.  Acting is quite often terrible too, no psychological immersion, all is a joke and with a little montage everything become possible... this movie is a waste of money and time, i want my money back!!! Do not waste money and time over this one! THE SPOILER PART REAT AT YOUR OWN DISCRECTION:  Think about : 1- growing potato over a soil not tested fertilized with astronauts "poo"... what about bacteria ? What about soil minerals and PH ? ... why he had potatoes in a martian station? (that's a joke) 2- why there is no scientific team studying and calculating ? Just a bunch of guys wandering around saying "yes" to the big boss or the minor actor acting like the "genius" ??  3- No information control at the NASA center??? Are you kidding me ??? An astronauts left alone over mars, does a real-time chatting with a "guy" (not even a psychologist) and such conversations are real-time public shared !!!! ARE YOU F*****G KIDDIN ME?????  4- sorry i forgot to mention that in such movie radiation are totally ignored, as you will never see the reflecting visor down even in "free space" while glancing at sun There are tons of those nonsenses in the movie... i just have time to write down 4, but all the movie is 2 hours of such nonsenses. TO CONCLUDE: this "movie" is an insult to the viewer, who liked it does ignore even the basic concepts of science, a terrible superficial plot. This "movie" is a scam, a fraud to steal our money. I've been cheated, listen to me and don't be fooled keep you time and money for something better.Not a good movie at all, can;t understand why people like it. Okay, I am also perplexed as to why people have given this terrible movie a favorable review. It seems like all we care about is a big name director and big star, then the movie has instant credibility. There was not one truly memorable moment in this movie. I cannot remember a single word, phrase, exchange of dialogue, or turn of event that left a lasting impression. The only positives were Matt Damon's likability and some decent special effects. For one thing how can this premise be taken ass even remotely plausible? Does anyone think that we would send ship to Mars that is vulnerable to a naturally and regularly occurring storm on Mars? And who would design a ship that is docked so perilously? It was standing up like one of those red/white/blue popsicle rocket treats we used to get from the ice cream man as a kid. Or even more than that it looked like a ship from a 1950's era sci-fi movie. C'mon man, this is a new millennium. Make a ship that is supported as it would be supported on Mars. It should be shorter and more stable, not doomed to tip over like shown in the movie. That one scene lost me for the next 30 minutes. Here are the other things I feel left me wanting with that movie. 1. When the storm struck I didn't know who was left behind. I knew it was the Matt Damon character but I didn't "know" him, meaning I had no emotional investment in that character. 2. He was a botanist, how convenient. His character didn't have to transform or change in any way in order to survive; he was the perfect guy to be left behind. 3. And just why were the potatoes going to run out??? They said you have 400 and something days, but never said why. Was it because there were other vital nutrients that would be lacking at that point? 4. If you give me 2 years to figure out how to solve a problem that means my survival, and there's nothing else to do but figure it out, I bet I'l find something too. The dates before his food was going to run out were so far out that I never felt a sense of urgency. You can call Mars "The Monster" but it wasn't pursuing the main character, just waiting for him to run out of food. How boring is that??? 5. When was the last time we saw nobody but good guys in a movie? There was nobody to blame, no bad guys anywhere. That was just plain weak. A bad guys doesn't have to be a bad person, just a person who either has too much fear or fears the wrong thing, which causes him/her to make poor choices. Nobody served as a villain in any way. I know from playing sports and working in small and large companies that there's always a person who feels like the bad guy, even unintentionally. This movie, with it's little slice of heaven, was absurd to say the least. For these reasons and other minor reasons I was totally disappointed. My wife liked it and I couldn't understand why. This was the dumbest movie I've seen in a long time. I really wanted to like ti but was terribly disappointed.The Martian: "Cast Away" Meets "Apollo 13" The Martian is a new Ridley Scott classic, featuring his best work in years, the best performance I've ever seen from Matt Damon, an outstanding supporting cast, a surprisingly funny screenplay from Daredevil creator Drew Goddard, and a great narrative that ties the film together beautifully.  As expected with Ridley Scott films, the film itself is visually stunning. The landscape of Mars looks absolutely breathtaking, and the scenes aboard the Hermes and back on Earth are just as sharp in detail and scope. The way he chose to make this film made it almost seem like an exceptionally made biopic. Many times during this film, I legitimately believed that Mark Watney was a real, living person that was actually stranded on Mars for many months alone. It's Cast Away meets Apollo 13, and this marriage is crafted beautifully.  Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant in this film. He plays Watney with so much optimism that it actually makes the depressing aspect of the film not as depressing for me. However, when he has to put on his dramatic chops in certain scenes, he truly commits to the drama of the situation, and that right there is true Ridley Scott suspense for you. The supporting cast, everyone involved, all do great work as well. Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor. He is one of the best actors working today, and this movie and 12 Years a Slave shows how far he's come.  The most surprisingly element about this movie though was the screenplay. The film is hilarious in some parts, in fact I'd argue that it's funnier than most comedies that have come out this year. What makes to movie unique to me was Watney's optimistic point of view. He believes that he isn't going to die on Mars, and this transforms this rather depressing situation into something comical instead. But when you really think about it, this is a very personal film about some people coming together to save somebody. That's it. And in today's world, it's nice to hear an story about people coming together to save one of their own.  I have nothing bad to say about The Martian. It's the best film I've seen all year.The Martian: A Classic by all means. I read some of the reviews and decided to review this title myself. That's because I'd like you not to miss this lovely movie. It got some very bad criticism (Reviews&amp;Ratings first page hosts at least 4 reviewers rating this title '1', lowest possible value on IMDb), most of which deals with Physics laws bended to screenwriter's desire.  Well I just want to reassure you that even though I am among the nerdiest guys on the Internet, I didn't get annoyed from what I saw. Not once. And if you weren't annoyed by Tom Hanks and his boys killing almost an entire German Division before giving up in 'Save Private Ryan' you won't be annoyed too. It's a movie, not a documentary. And it's a great movie, a classic by all means.I Am The Only One Who Was Not Disappointed Having read the book, and being very impressed, I was looking forward to the movie interpretation. I was not the least bit disappointed. I was hoping this movie would not be an overacted, overproduced and sappy version of the original, and I was pleasantly surprised that the story played out without the overblown extraneous embellishment that Hollywood seems to depend on so often. It was great to see how the screenplay added extra material that was not in the book, and it enhanced the story to make it even better. The characters were interpreted with full respect to the intention of the author, Andy Weir, and nothing was overdone. The pacing and editing of this movie was some of the best I've seen, in fact, some of the one-liners from the book are done so quickly it pushed the story forward relentlessly.  One thing that struck me is that everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I think that could be a testament to the originality and uniqueness of the book. I believe anyone who reads the book is captivated and involved with the story from beginning to end, and it's possible this comes across in all phases of the production; the acting, the sets, sound, everything. They all knew they had some great material to work with and ran with it.I'm giving up on Ridley Scott! Man, I was so disappointed by this movie! Did I have too high expectations? I don't think so. If you have a bunch of actually Hollywood-A-class actors and a director who made "Blade Runner" and "Alien", you are officially allowed to have expectations! But they all failed terribly in my opinion. I could rant about the bad jokes, the awful soundtrack and the cheesy 3D-renderings - why didn't they manage one single time to make these things, the ship, the rover, actually look big? It all looked like toys! Awful! But my biggest complaint is the terrible storytelling! The movie had zero suspense from beginning to end. It was always, hey we have a problem, let's have a cool dialog/monologue, and then, hey, we'll solve the problem within the next minute - no problem at all! Hey, I got no milk in the fridge, OK I'll get some from the supermarket... That level of depth. I didn't feel for one single minute with the main character and I couldn't have cared less, when he had died in the end. There was at some points emotional music and we all were told, that this and that is dangerous and what not. But I couldn't feel it at all. Just for comparison: "Gravity" had me on the edge of the seat and "Interstellar" had me hold my breath. Not to mention "Moon", "Blade Runner" and "Odyssee". Wasn't there a time, when Ridley Scott made actually great movies? Do yourself a favor and spend the money on something else. This movie isn't worth it.Project Elrond A NASA crew on Mars evacuates during a bad storm, Mark (Matt Damon) is believed dead and is left behind. However, he is not dead and needs to be resourceful to survive until the next mission, over a year away. However it it not as bad as "Gravity" or "Cast Away" without Wilson. Mark (plot spoiler revealed in previews) manages to make contact with Earth and we have a subplot to break up the monotony of a one man play. The film is designed primarily for science geeks. There is a lot of terms for them, many are broken down, some inanely as when a sling shot effect had to be explained to the head of NASA, something they do all the time. With all the hype of an Oscar nomination, I thought the film would have been better. It was good, I enjoyed it, but I don't believe it belongs in the Science Fiction hall of fame. There are no space aliens, ghosts, or anything crazy like that. Science fiction, not science fantasy. As far as science goes, my understanding is that Martian soil has a high perchlorate content hindering plant growth. Also NASA is leery of sending anyone to Mars as the radiation dose they will get on a round trip would be considered a lifetime dose for the astronauts, ending their careers and greatly increasing the risk of a latent radiation induced cancer etc. Fantastic film Excellent film: the science is accurate, the acting is solid, and the film carries an emotional depth that previous reviewers, who have been panning it, seem to have missed (but maybe they're not used to films where spaceships DON'T make noise in the vacuum in space and the audience actually has to think). One of Ridley Scott's best films.A film about growing potatoes with poop A film about growing potatoes with poop. That's it.Fantastic It was well made, sure, but Childish Gambino was in it, so it's fantastic. Too bad Sean Bean did not die. Was disappointed. That'll happen.Great EFX but a bit preposterous, boring, yet spellbinding? With 1100 reviews, I suppose that few people may read this, but here goes: Fantastic sets and special effects. I wish I had seen this on a big screen. I am sure that it has been compared to everything from "2001" to "Apollo 13". It seems a bit tedious, but that might be because of the 3 hour cable broadcast time if you don't DVR it. An astronaut presumed dead is accidentally left behind when a long-term Mars Mission is aborted due to an intense hurricane force Martian sand storm is encountered. The first third of the movie centers on how Astronaut "Mark" manages to set up housekeeping, grow his own crops, and re-establish communications with Houston Control. Then it shift gears and become a rescue mission much like Apollo 13. There are equipment failures along the way and the mission crew almost commits mutiny when they decide to double back and rescue the stranded man. Smart and intelligently presented by Ridley Scott but not everyone's "cup of tea". I enjoyed it but found many badly-answered plot hole questions: There seems to be an unlimited supply of oxygen in the space suits. Maybe they can manufacture it in the suit? The "Power of Duct Tape" creates a perfect air seal. (I guess it really is the handyman's secret weapon?) A partial nudity shower scene is really unnecessary. Even after a clear plastic seal blows out, the entire craft doesn't fog up and blow apart? Oh, well, enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect it all to make perfect sense.The Martian Damon died in a challenge inside and outside the film. The movie Mars may not be a logical or purely scientific film, but certainly succeeded in satisfying everyone as a film science fiction exciting. The film is directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon and Jessica Shastin. It is believed that Mark has died and left alone on Mars, and begins a struggle to survive while trying to communicate. On earth, in the hope of saving him, Marc remains without a thing in this planet, which is twice as large as the Earth, and there is nothing but himself and what the crew left before the forced departure. One of the film's problems that you may read about is the storm that led to Mark's departure in the first place. Mars's atmosphere is about 1% as compared to the Earth, so Mars winds, which may reach 100 mph "which is rare in the Mars climate" would be like winds at ten miles an hour on Earth, Flying a paper plane in the sky not to fall humans. Beyond that film is excellent in almost all respects, since the beginning of the film can not stop stunned by what Ridley Scott of visual effects, and continue to amaze something something with the stages of passage of the film. The film begins in a desert desert similar to the environment of Mars, as we know from the images of him, red, arid, empty, filled with horrifying silence. The film moves to two stages. The film then moves to two sides, the psychological aspect of Mark being that he has nothing more than he can think of getting to his home and family, and the aspect that makes him one of the most responsible and discoverable people. Here lies the details, the film may not be perfect in writing. Both are in these two sides. When you see a movie that tells the story of the horror of loneliness, you have to think of two aspects (psychological and physical). The physical aspect I thought for a moment was that Matt Damon's work was a mighty example until I knew that the whole thing was just an effect on a computer, which increases visual dazzling and its effects and reduces The actor's creativity and sacrifices for the role.  In an interview with Matt Damon, he said he wanted to lose weight for the role, but director Ridley Scott stopped him. "He talked to Ridley about losing weight for the role, because I had already done it for the movies, Almost a month ago I said that the time is perfect. I can lose 30 to 40 pounds and start shooting from the end scenes back to the beginning until I get back to my normal body. "Riddle Scott" replied "F * ck that". As for the psychological side, yes, there was a conflict, and yes, Dimon was good at it, but it was not enough for me to see the dramatic dramas, being on Mars, knowing that you are 140 million miles from Earth, home, home, family. Because you will not see human beings after today in your life, it is very frightening once you think about it, so I had a desire to stress on a dramatic scene that would be screaming and whining and then supplication and crying. but it's okay. Some may notice the American championship in the film, or even the mathematical complexities, when we calculate the number of years between Mars and the Earth or the speed of Mark's or even attraction between the planets and others, but the film certainly did not make it more sophisticated than the movie Nolan among the stars, Understand some of them and do not mind their presence, because it will not actually stop them, in turn will increase the quality of the scientific background of the film, which puts it in a challenge with the scientists who will see it. The film is not the ideal film in all its analogies, but it is certainly interesting to the viewer, a victory for Ridley Scott the rest of the workers, from the voices to the visual effects and even fashion .. A poetic and objective film at the same time, and above all we can not but stand in hugs for the creativity of Matt Damon and his grandmother to portray The scene of the dramatic car and the rest of the film with complete creativity.

The charm of the story for me is, that it heavily emphasizes the Science in Sci-Fi. The whole thing is (mostly) sound and very well explained, so even technical illiterate readers can follow. For this movie someone decide to dumb down the content and take shortcuts and - surprise - mistakes, failures and plot holes ensue and some things simply make no sense anymore (just look at the goofs list - you could make a book out of them). Then again some scenes were unnecessarily added to confuse even further to make up for plot twists that were cut. This messy screenplay can't be saved by the cast. Most of the characters are but a faint shadow of their book selves. Take crewman Vogel for example. Would anybody have guessed him to be German, if it wasn't for the patch on his suit? Jeff Daniels seems to wear a stiff neck and all the characters interactions feel like packed in cotton. Those guys should be passionate and fight for their opinions especially since the lives of astronauts are on the line and depend on their decisions. They are highly trained specialists in their field of work and have to fight against political red tape. Non of this was in the movie. They could have had a more passionate discussion about a burgers or football. And don't even get me started on the props. Think about airplane furniture and then shave that down even more to get rid of any unnecessary gram, while barely preserving basic function. Where was that in the movie? The Hub looked like it was built to house colonists for decades and not to serve as a pressurized shelter for a two month mission. The movie-Hermes consists mostly of large corridors without any purpose and large window panes. A spaceship like this would never be approved. I could go on forever, but it all boils down to this: Andy Weir went to great length to make the plot and every action the protagonist take plausible and get his book scientifically correct. That's what I love about it and why I was looking forward to the movie. And then I got handed this stupid, dumbed down, senseless piece of trash.Great, realistic, space adventure 'The Martian' is based on Andy Weir's excellent novel - one of my favourite books from last year. It's a very simple concept - in the near-future, a manned-mission to Mars goes awry and Mark Watney (Damon) is presumed dead, as the rest of the team returns to Earth. However, rumours of Watney's demise were exaggerated and he just manages to survive, only to be faced with the conundrum of how to stay alive on a freezing planet with almost no food, water or oxygen until he can be rescued? It's beautifully shot, with Jordan a good stand-in for Mars on most occasions, and the CGI doing the rest. And there's obviously a few shots of Earth from space - always a great perspective to see. Scott directs well, with the pacing good, and time spread across the strong cast - Chastain, Pe√±a, Mara, Stan and Hennie on the spaceship home; and Daniels, Ejifor, Bean and Wiig at NASA - showing how everyone involved deals with the initial tragedy and then attempted rescue mission(s). However, the film belongs to Damon, who has to use all his charm and skills to make one man talking to a video journal interesting. The film's possibly 15min or so too long, but luckily, it's a great book &amp; a good screenplay, so there's plenty of levity to go along with the serious life-or-death/fingernail-chewing moments. Tense/great final 25min or so. Never quite reaches the heights of the book, but comes very close.Great Scott Some reviewer on this site said don't trust any reviews that give this film more than 2 stars because they aren't genuine. Well let me say having just watched it that I wouldn't trust any review that give it less than 7 stars. If this was La La Land I would have agreed as that was overrated rubbish but this was superbly crafted wonderfully acted and a joy to behold. Not at any time during its 141 mins was I not totally engrossed and exhilarated by this total cinematic experience. I'll even go as far as to say this maybe the best film that Ridley Scott has directed.Captures the excitement, humor, and humanity of the book Full disclosure: I read (and enjoyed) this book. So I'm going to be one of those people who says "They got this right, but they got this wrong." Bottom line, though, they adapted this REALLY well. Scott captured what survival and problem solving looks like, and managed all the excitement/humor/humanity that made the book great. I would have loved a little more explanation and a little less self-seriousness, but there's no way not to enjoy this ride.Smart, thrilling, and surprisingly funny Super good, enjoyed this one a lot. Sort of a mix of Castaway and Gravity with Matt Damon taking on the deserted Hanks role, explaining things to a video diary along the way after he is left stranded on Mars and presumed dead by his crew. With meager supplies he must find a way to contact Earth, make oxygen and grow some food. Its very funny. This did feel a bit too long but in saying that I also can't think of any scenes that were unnecessary. Great special effects and finally a movie using CGI and green screens to enhance the movie not just BE the movie as is often the case these days, where movies forget about a story and just become special effect extravaganzas. It did get a bit over-the-top towards the end with Damon in his Ironman reminiscent suit but I went with it. Worth a watch. Oh, this is based on a book by Andy Weir.Globe Earth Propaganda The most unrealistic part of this movie, is not the fact that Matt Damon started a potato farm out of his own feces in space, but THE PREPOSTEROUS FACT THAT SPACE AND OTHER PLANETS EXIST!1! As a Christian Mom, I must tell you that the whole idea behind space, planets and even a globe earth is so unrealistic that I had to remove my 7 children from the cinema mid-way through and then perform an exorcism on them. I tried to contact Hollywood and demand this movie is removed from all cinemas within Christian governed nations but they wouldn't answer my e-mails or my calls. Alas I am here to try and convince all Christian citizens of the World, to avoid this movie like the plague. Also i'd like to inform you that NASA is a satanic organisation that throws arsenic in our water supply and that vaccines are made of sin. This movie proudly displays the ridiculous idea of space, which I am pretty sure is a myth (just like physics and sanitation). The only reason I am giving this movie is getting anything more than a 1/10 is because of Matt Damon. Check out my Matt Damon erotic fanfictions, if you want to make my Christian soul happy! :) Thank y'all. Vote Trump and don't forget that existing is a sin! Support West Ham United!Disappointing This film lacked tension and any strong interaction between the characters - such as they were. Quite soon into watching I felt that it was being strangled by political correctness. It is bland; it is beige; it is, quite simply, not compelling. Towards the end I completely lost interest in it, so little did I care about the outcome.Clunky Mess not deserving of any Oscar nominations Cant believe this was nominated for 7 Oscars.  Matt Damon plays a scientist of sorts, in fact a botanist who after an accident is left on mars alone ,to survive he starts fertilising potatoes with his own excrement . What started brightly decent soon descended into a clunky mess which left me rolling my eyes. The scenes on earth with NASA were cringey and i was saying to myself no one talks like that in real life, it was like i was watching a Judd Apatow film ,Kristen Wiig has about 2 lines of dialogue but appears in the background in almost every scene looking on the verge of a stroke ,then there's Damon who had zero background to his character -are we led to believe that a scientist left on a distant planet thousands of miles away from home , doesn't suffer any adverse affects other than weight loss, doesn't feel any anger or anxiety or any other emotion, to cope he just makes corny jokes and listens to disco music Absurd premise with no depth or emotion and if wasn't directed by Ridley Scott it would of passed through the cinema without notice. Scott is the most overrated director going.several science mistakes in this movie Probably The Most Weird bit of all is the fact that Matt says that an explosion from a sort of water generator was caused by the excess OXYGEN that he breathed out: 1. You breath out co2 not oxygen 2. you would not cause an explosion by breathing a single breath of wind 3. How would like 10gs of wood chips burn for some like: 200 sols? he would need 10 kg instead of grams. Duct tape does not help in taping together a hole. It just doesn't. And I don't see any seals in that. all there is is a tarp and a few straps and duct tapes strips to seal it together. Mark uses duct tape to fix his spacesuit, attach a dangerous plutonium reactor, and to seal of a giant hole in the wall of the HAB, the base of the mission. The alarming fact is that it is 100% worrying when you hear the flapping sound of the tarp, and sending a person on a rocket ship with its nose cut off and replaced with a tarp is totally nonsensical.  Overall, This is an okay movie but if you are one of those experts on film better not watch it. or if you are a scientist.Golden Globe for comedy, comedians miscast in serious roles. ABBA soundtrack. Contrived to make money. Awful, awful. This movie may have been initially popular, but it will fade away. To better imagine being on Mars I had to mute the sound to imagine Watney breathing in his space suit whilst he worked, You do get the impression of being on Mars but this is not sustained because of the comedic overtones and stupendous miscasting. I imagined another version being released in the future - a true space drama- deleting the wisecracks, replacing the soundtrack, and reinforcing the success factors such as the sense of isolation, the science, and the fear. But that's not going to happen. People forget this movie is a comedy, yet it is thoroughly unfunny, but it did win a Golden Globe for comedy. Touch√© from the accountants! Audiences do love an optimistic fantasy depicting triumph over adversity. And what fantasy! The sandstorm that stranded Watney would be no more fierce than being pelted by talcum powder given Mars thin atmosphere. The storm would barely raise a flag. And then there is Watney. Perpetual optimist, says he's a botanist, but botanists are not farmers nor gardeners. The garden he creates is ridiculous, too shallow with no drainage, and the crop yield fantastical (see one of the reviews below which explores this in detail). Watney doesn't suffer much. He is playful, always strong, optimistic, jovial, confident. I don't see him triumphing over adversity."Apollo 13" Meets "Interstellar"¬ÖBut Not Quite As Good As Either "The Martian" is a solid movie. It has an interesting plot, some good character development, and (in a complete departure from most Ridley Scott films) contains a very hopeful, at times even light-hearted tone. Most people viewing this will find it a very enjoyable experience all-around. Here is the problem, though: About a year ago, "Interstellar" was made by Christopher Nolan. It shares many similar character types and themes with "The Martian"¬Öbut manages to beat it in nearly every single area. So, I have to say that it was a little weird seeing this movie and thinking that not only it wasn't as good as "Interstellar", but now it is chronologically second-fiddle too. For a basic plot summary, "The Martian" primarily tells the story of a member of the Aries III crew exploring Mars sometime in Earth's future. A violent windstorm picks up and astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is flung off into the eye of the storm and presumed dead, his fellow crewmates having to make a tough decision and a quick getaway. Due to some incredible luck, however, Watney is most certainly not dead¬Öjust stranded on Mars with few supplies and not enough food to last until any sort of retrieval mission can be furnished. The catch? Watney is a scientist (a botanist, to be exact), and must tap into all of his ingenuity and wits in order to survive until NASA can pick him up again. Like I said, "The Martian" is a pretty good movie when looked at with tunnel-vision. It has all the right ingredients for a great sci-fi drama, and those ingredients do indeed gel together to form an entertaining final product. It has some high-concept themes, impressive visuals, and that sense of gravitas befitting films like "Apollo 13". Damon turns in a great performance, and his scenes are the highlight of the entire experience (had the movie focused on him even more exclusively, I probably would have liked it even better!). There are indeed two major problems that keep this film from being a classic sci-fi adventure, though: 1. The casting besides Damon is very poor. Jeff Daniels is terrible as the head of NASA, as is Kristen Wiig in a similar corporate role, and Jessica Chastain's character is inexplicably under- utilized. As such, the scenes where Damon isn't front-and-center really drag the fun to a halt. 2. Maybe this isn't 100% fair, but it still stands that this movie can't really hold a candle to Nolan's masterful "Interstellar", and that turned into kind of a problem during the viewing experience. I mean, think of it this way: A film featuring Chastain, Damon, space travel, space anomalies, and all set in a very hopeful tone. Where have you seen that movie before? I know that "The Martian" is based on a book and thus it is difficult to scream "plagiarism" too loud, but having not read the book I really don't know how closely it was followed. To me, then, this sure seemed like an opportunity to capitalize on the success by using the same general themes of the previous "Interstellar". Bottom line: Had I seen this movie a year or so ago, I may have liked it considerably more. However, once one has seen movies like "Interstellar" before it, it kind of feels old-hat. Not a bad movie by any means (and hence the four-star rating), but also not all that close to being one that will be remembered for years, either.What is a long movie or it felt really long? Better read the synopsis before watching The Martian. I did not. That's why I thought it would be some fun sci-fi movie about astronauts landing in Mars and having to defend themselves from the attack of creatures from another planet. Well, that wasn't what the movie was, and I wish it would be. The first hour of the Martian felt long, dragging and utterly boring. Matt Damon, left alone by himself in Mars spends the first half of the movie regurgitating technicalities to a camera where he records himself while explaining what he has to do to survive alone in this new "home". If he didn't it would be just impossible for people to understand all the things he is doing. In the second half the movie, a rescue mission gets ready to pick him up, so they talk an talk and talk again in endless meetings about what needs to be done to save their man while the world is watching. Although this second part is slightly more entertaining than the first one, I really could not wait for the movie to finish. Boring! It's all i can say.Not Equal to the Hollywood Hype If it's a cold rainy night and you have nothing to do, curl up with a bag of popcorn, and you'll find this film is an OK diversion, but if you're expecting the next Apollo 13, or Stanley Kubrick classic, you will be disappointed.  The basic plot is the typical adventure, action, suspense formula with rather predictable turns and barely enough of predicable problems which the scientists will have to solve just in the nick of time.  The real problems with The Martian are centered around the script and character development. The script could have been written by seventh graders who were given bonus points for trying to write as many clich√© lines as possible. What's worse, is the fact that none of the characters including that of Matt Damon's have any real development as people with whom you can empathize. Good dram is always more than the actions of the plot. Good drama is about people and their relationships, conflicts, struggles, etc. We know nothing about these people and therefore can never develop the empathy necessary for good engaging drama.  Lots of great visuals, some bad disco music, and an OK story line.Basically it's "Cast Away" set on another planet I saw this movie with friends and enjoyed it, although I found it to be strangely reminiscent of CAST AWAY, staring Tom Hanks. The best parts are when the stranded Astronaut uses his scientific knowledge growing potatoes to stretch his food supply and his calculations in seeking out and finding/reactivating the Pathfinder lander. Those scenes illustrate the kind of psychology one would need to survive while being stranded on Mars with limited resources. Damon does a fine job in these moments. The rest of the movie is kind of melodramatic, even thought Jeff Daniels made a convincing NASA Administrator. The ending is a bit silly, as tearing his spacesuit would have killed him rather quickly, not propelled him far enough to reach the ship commander. A lot of that was just the melodrama to make it more exciting. I understand the book ending was much different. Overall a decent movie and an excellent one for planetary colonization enthusiasts to watch. There is a good bit of science fact mixed with the fiction part. It's basically CAST AWAY, except on Mars.  For movies of this genre, I prefer the setting of MOON as a more possible scenario with the mining operation. Just my personal take.2015 vs. 1953 If you are either a cinema enthusiast in general or just a science fiction flicks fan, and somehow was able to sit through the entirety of "Project Moon Base" (1953) telling a story about an orbital survey mission changing into unplanned Moon landing, you can come to this conclusion: there are just light years of filmmaking between similar themed 1953 and 2015 movies. That first one does not get even the basic science elements right and has naively stupid and childish script, resulting in a picture just doomed to not withstand the test of time; while the newer "The Martian" is both so accurate / logical as a non-documentary feature can be and is technically at the highest levels Unfortunately that great distance shrinks noticeably in the middle of this newer movie, when the first part of the absolutely thrilling and entertaining Robinson "The Martian" Crusoe hits the scene of kindergarten-like pandering to the Chinese audience. (Because let us Hollywood executives and investors do not forget, that our beloved comrades on Mainland China have more cinemas than we here have in The-US-Of-A-Land and that only thirty something foreign titles per year get a full distribution in China). It slowly but inevitably shifts from an excellent survival drama with educational values to a mediocre drama with more adventure driven orientation, sticking mostly to the entertainment side. Practically it is no longer a drama but a tragedy- a tragedy of a downfall from a possible 10 / 10 picture to a flick with a score of only 6-7 / 10. For example they start to put all those "classic" (boring) songs, and not just in fragments. Why, just why did they use the excellent "All Along The Watchtower" by Jimmy Hendrix in the trailer (and for that purpose even creatively remixed it a little), but in the movie itself they took the path of least resistance of using that kitschy "Starman" by David Bowie (and in its entirety)? And that final rescue attempt, with more and more layers of obstacles? Were those space cowboy stunts really conceived some time before 2015 and not in 1953?Don't Go Anywhere Matt We're Comin back ta Get Ya.... Are you ready for a feel good movie about being left to die on Mars - well "The Matian" could be it! (could be a couple of spoilers if there's anyone left who has not already seen this one). This offers all the fun of being left out in the frozen night - then waking up next morning totally ALONE on Mars. Our astronaut (Matt Damon) has been speared in the gut and surviving in a space suit that has a hole punched in it. After some initial grueling pain we surprisingly find Matt doesn't really seem to mind all that much. Nice images, good locations, some good original score music (in between the compulsory hit-parade-chart-toppers designed for the sales promo sound-track album), then along come those assorted characters from the central casting stereo-types catalog - you know them all from just about every other big budget crowd pleaser over the past 25 years. The stony, super cool NASA chief ~ super smart female space craft commanders who show little fear or sign of human concern - simply reduced to 'gung ho' utterings like: "OK lets go get our boy"! ~ Chinese scientists willing to give away billions of dollars and years of "Top Secret" equipment and information - all just to get a nice outcome for this lone U.S. astronaut ~ understanding wives and children who smilingly wish their life partners well - after being told they've voted to put their lives on the line for a one in a thousand mission. Not enough for you? - there are many others to be found but go see for yourself. It's beginning to seem like NASA is being reduced to product placement in space. Even the the 55yr old poorly named: "Robinson Caruso On Mars" fared a little better in the human psychological stakes. 'The Martian' is really just another typical Ridley Scott movie so if you enjoy those, then none of the above will concern you - now I understand why it ended up on general cable less than a year after its Cinema release. While some of its two hrs plus is watchable, those that are lovers of fantastic big budget space adventures will actually enjoy it all but, if that's not you - then blast off with caution...oh, further warning: you may also need to dodge all those awards that were thrown at this offering.MATT...DAMON (in Team America voice) a pawn for new age space interest? Okay so randomly a frigging BOTANIST is brought to a desolate wasteland of a planet, and then left behind and somehow survives. THIS WAS FROM A STORM THAT ALL of the other astronauts fled for fear of their very lives, and the botanist survives... WTF?! In comes the fact that of all the things not on a mission that is needed for him to survive, there are bits of wood from the one token chicano guy, in the form of a wooden cross among his affects. Nobody else had religious iconography, what the hay? Then the loner breaks up the cross to use as fuel to create water for his botany experiment. He creates water like its nothing, making something NASA would not have done, at least in the film, seem ASTOUNDINGLY simplistic, for a guy whom is supposed to just be a botanist. This is beginning to reek like Gravity did. Still it distracts from all the classic low brow Damonesque slurs and cussing that has been a mark of his in acting since Good Will Hunting. ENTER THE KAKA STORM! So after digging into whats supposed to be dead soil, burying feces, by burning the lone Mexican's wooden cross, the stranded man creates virtual mini hydrogen bombs in an oxygenated environment (*faceplams*). The far too average spaceman then points out that the astronauts were supplied with a highly radioactive substance, that after hardly any use, is just dumped onto mars underneath but a few feet of ground. So already humans turn the world into a garbage dump, but its okay because Damon uses it to warm himself while humorously listening to Hot Stuff by Donna Summer. Then pausing for comedic effect.  THIS IS STUPID! Damon is literally spending most of the film on candid camera like its a reality TV show. Are we to be impressed by an actor trying so blatantly to survive upon an alien word, on a screen within a screen? Not if one has respect for themselves, let alone the art of acting.  SO then the man with the one trait he claims to have utmost expertise in just happens to dig up his crop of potatoes after barely 48 days, with potatoes bigger than some fists. FORTY EIGHT DAYS?! Either nasa found the one strain of miracle grow anywhere potatoes, or they cheapened out on the healthier organics for these space cadets' mission. Thems some gmo tatter tots, WIll Hunting.  Onward with the stupidity. So back on earth the mission command wonders where the leftover cadet is going to journey to, and instead of using most ANY of the sophisticated equipment to plan his course, they just run off to the cafeteria and use a ruler on a picture of craters and it just happens to do the trick. Really? Then comes the use of simple phrases to communicate over a vast distance, one lame nerd whom derides the point of trying at all like a useless emo teen star, and as we were about to be unintentionally woken up form this bullmess, the director just pulls folks back in. I can just see people in the theaters when this movie came out. Deplorable. This was all less than one hour into the film. I had wanted to quit, but kept watching, and was just bored as hell. Then there was more pointless babble and posing and fame from afar snap shots, then planning and untold amounts of cash spent to save one fool take form. Then came poor planning, unlikely execution and a lot of destruction of expensive equipment and wasting of air in an oxygen-less environment. He is then saved, comes home, time passes, the world is distracted from all its real problems blah blah. Later on Damon sits and marvels at a little sapling, reminding him of his martian poop factory for potatoes, all the while admired by the most racially mixed group of young astronauts jogging by him, which still was not that diverse at all. Now I already knew this was gross fiction, but come on, space programs are about as diverse as a teen clothing ad from the mid 90's. IN THE SOUTHERN STATES. Waste of my time by modern cinema, YET AGAIN! We already messed up one corner of the universe, we don't need another done in by: MATT...DAMON. But hey, its not like Hollywood is being used to make us interested in spending billions to launch off into fruitless missions without solving our problems here...OH WAIT. =_=Kind of flat Not bad, a few funny bits, a few thought provoking bits, but overall fairly flat in the acting department (with the exception of Michael Pena). Really ready for Hollywood to move on from Jessica Chastain's tough grrrrl leader roles... Her subplot at the end was farcical. Would have been nice to see a real philosophical discussion from Jeff Daniels' character about the harsh reality behind "what are you willing to pay to save one man's life". Is it worth $2 million? $20 million? $200 million? Could you have a gotten a Starbucks or Tesla owner to step up and foot the bill for a space launch? (maybe that's more criticism of the source material).Too much melodrama for 2 hours and 20 mins The subject of the movie is very good, a man who tries to survive in Mars in isolation and tries to make a connection with the world, again in order to survive. The unbearable thing about the movie is too much melodrama. There is melodrama in every scene, even at the cheerful ones. Music, shooting and acting are so overwhelmingly dramatic that movie does not even let you experience its drama; it goes through all emotions by itself. In other words, the events and their reflection on us are shadowed by the over dramatization in the movie. Additionally, the structure of the scenerio is also overwhelming, as there are many peaks of it, presented through the very dramatic music. That degree of melodrama is bearable when the world is attacked by aliens or zombies, and there are actions scenes. Stay away from this movie if you do not like melodrama, but you may like it if you LOVE the subject or fan of the book or any actor in the movie.Great! BEST Sci/fi movie ever!!. Awesome Matt Damon,10/10Good for the first 90 minutes but tediously overlong The first hour is interesting and engaging but the plot starts to tail off after 90 minutes and the final hour is dull and irritating. The attempts at humourous scenes fall flat and detract from the tension which has been building. Ditto the choice of music - as if 2001 A Space Odyssey had used Priscilla Queen of the Desert for its soundtrack. Ultimately, this film seems to be confused about what it wants to be. It starts out as a gripping thriller but then turns into something weirdly light-hearted. A pity, it showed promise but didn't deliver.Good film if you do not mind a little Star Trek type script... The movie mixed science fiction with a real life portrayal of life in space fairly well. Plot also examines the politics of space disasters as well. There is some Star trek dialog in the script, which may or may not turn some people off. Part of the movie that pissed me off was that it did not seem to give much credit to Rich Purnell for his idea...(see movie). Brian GhilliorriCast Away on Mars with Matt Damon The title says everything i need to say. Apart from the fact that it is far more fun to watch Tom Hanks doing nothing, than Matt Damon. I'd assume anyone rating this over a 7/10 is a Matt Damon fanboy.It's a fictional movie people; enjoy it for what it is... I watched this film and enjoyed it because it's not considered non-fiction; it's a fictional account of what might happen if an astronaut were abandoned on Mars. Too many people who are submitting reviews are trying to get too technical. People, just enjoy the movie for what it is.Strove to present correct science.....REALLY?? Generally the movie was good....lots of quasi-science which, although improbable, didn't stretch the bounds too far but the ending......really? We're supposed to believe that the rocket nose....in order to save weight, jettisons the hard cap and replaces it with....wait for it....CANVAS. If you do the math, the only speed quoted, which is BEFORE the maximum thrust, converts to about 2600 kilometers per hour. Now I've put my arm out the window at about 150 KPH and had the hair nearly blown off so I'm pretty sure 2600 KPH is more than a little improbable. Since the entire movie is predicated on hoping we will believe at least some of the science why couldn't they have just picked a smaller number to reduce it which didn't entail removing all the windows and the nosecone 'cause I'm pretty sure they'd be necessary at 2600 KPH....just saying.Never give up even if everything goes wrong. Stop and calmly think. This is an interesting story about a man who tries to survive and doesn't give up. He just doesn't give up and doesn't stress out too much, he continues working. This is what this movie is about.. It is an interesting movie and NASA and space stuff does look realistic (even though in real life it might be different actually). I really liked Jeff Daniels (guy from Dumb &amp; Dumber) character, he is very serious, a real director and made this movie more realistic, because I think that his decisions really looked like something a real life director would do (for example in the end he didn't want to risk 5 astronauts for 1).I'm going to have to review the sh*t out of this THE MARTIAN follows botanist Mark Watney who, during a manned mission to Mars, is hit by a fierce storm and left behind by his crew who presume that he's dead. But little did they know that he's still very much alive, stranded on the hostile planet. With limited resources at hand, Watney must draw upon his ingenuity in order to survive.  Having only seen the trailers, I went into this film unaware of how much humor there would actually be. In that regard, it's quite faithful to the source material; Drew Goddard was able to inherit author Andy Weir's snarky dialogue and translate it from the pages of a novel onto the pages of a screenplay, while Sir Ridley Scott brought it all to life.  Speaking of Ridley Scott, it looked as if the legendary director's best days were behind him, entering a career slump of sorts with The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings, both of which were dull and uninspired chapters of his otherwise impressive filmography. THE MARTIAN, however, marks Ridley Scott 's return to form. It's captivating from beginning to end, enjoyable from beginning to end, and is full of personality from, you guessed it, beginning to end. A lot of that personality, if not all of it, is due to the incredible group of actors that have been rounded up here, most notably Matt Damon. If not for him and the way he charismatically delivers his lines the sarcastic dialogue, which is really just Damon talking to a video recorder, would 've just ended up being really awkward. Chewitel Ejiofor and Jessica Chastain both make strong impressions as well, along with the rest of the cast who have small, yet potent moments of their own.  Despite having convincing performances, the film didn't do as good of a job trying to get me to naturally invest in these characters. Sure, you care for Mark Watney's life but that's only because of the situations that the story places him in and forces him to face; there was no real emotional through line for me to grab hold of.  But the thing that stops me from calling THE MARTIAN "great" is that it's a very safe, by the numbers, sci-fi film. It doesn't have the technical drive of Gravity or the emotional punch of Interstellar; it's very good, but it could've been so much more.Sir Ridley at his best Ridley Scott knows science fiction. The director of iconic and cult crowned sci-fi flicks Blade Runner and Alien, Scott is no slouch when it comes to futuristic or outerspaceish type scenarios played out through his keen direction. Scott last dipped his toe into the sci-fi waters in 2012 with the love it or hate it Alien prequel, Prometheus. The film was met with varying degrees of acceptance and disapproval but no one could deny the film was visually spectacular. In 2015, Scott brings Andy Weir's novel of the same name to audiences in the inspiring, The Martian due to hit theatres early October. Matt Damon plays NASA botanist Mark Watney. Watney along with a small group of other scientists are stationed on Mars when a storm prompts their evacuation. Through a series of events, his colleagues believe Watney dead as they execute their evacuation. But Watney is very much alive. Alive and alone on Mars. With little resources and materials, Watney sciences the poop out of his working assets in an effort to survive. He manages to relay a message back to earth but he is very much aware of the realization that any rescue effort or further mission to Mars is years away from actualization. Watney must live on his wits and faith in hopes that he may one day be reunited with species. The focus is clearly on Damon's character but maybe more interesting are the team of humans back on earth lead by Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels that attempt to science the poop out of things themselves in an attempt to orchestrate a spectacular rescue. Their pooling of minds will draw reference to NASA's brain trusts in Ron Howard's Apollo 13 and is riveting the exciting to watch unfold though the emotion of the colleagues. We'll leave the final chapters of the film to your viewing pleasure but make no mistake about it, The Martain is Ridley Scott's best film in years. Damon excels in the lonely character left abandoned. He carries the film with remarkable poise and the intelligence of the script by Drew Goddard (Cabin in the Woods, World War Z) is a marvel as to what man has and can accomplish when faced an unfathomable situation. The 3D imagery is spectacular and the special effects are sometimes toned and other times on the scale of a blockbuster big-budget extravaganza. But the film is rooted in the triumph of the human spirit. It's hard not to cheer or cry when we see a balls-out effort to what it takes, to use what it takes, to work tirelessly in what it takes to save one human life. The Martian is destined to be box office hit. Smart, funny, tense and drawing on emotion, it is easily one of the best films of the year and it is the type of film that might just have children once again naming 'astronaut' as the profession that they most aspire to. Yes, it's that good. http://theintestinalfortitude.com/Wrong approach to the book I have read (and loved) the book, and I am not distancing myself from that in this review. There's many ways to adapt material, and in a sense, The Martian is very faithful to the book it is based on. Obviously you can not fit an entire book into a movie, so you would have to skip parts of the plot, etc.. The book the movie is based on is in large parts the astronaut's first hand account of what is going on, the logs he writes. The movies have him making video accounts of the same, so we can hear the character say the lines instead of writing them. All of this makes sense. What I disagree with, was what the movie decided to put its main focus on. It has picked a couple of moments from the book and spent quite a lot of time on them, and fast forwarded through the rest. This has the effect of making Watney's stay "easier" then it is in the book. To me, the book was at its most interesting when Watney was coming up with great solutions, and explaining how he did so. The movie has some of this, but skips most of explanations, choosing to rather "show than tell" (which you'd think be a good thing). That said, I thought they picked great actors to play all of the roles, and all in all I appreciate how close to the book the movie was with what it decided to have on screen. I wish the movie all the best, but would really have preferred if it was done differently. I don't know how, but for this movie I would not have minded an almost continuous voice-over. Or at least for the movie to be longer. Or maybe replace most of the parts without Watney in them, having rather the ongoings on earth being related through other means. I don't know what would work the best, but the direction they went for was a big disappointment to me.Beautiful scenery, a great cast and a down-to-Earth story makes a genuine cinematic experience. The Martian sees Matt Damon play astronaut / botanist Mark Watney as he survives stranded on Mars after an accident during a mission leaves him presumed dead. The Martian is a sci-fi thriller and adventure, showing a return to form for Ridley Scott. This shows space is what he does best. As soon as the film begins you are just immersed by the scenery. Some of the wide shots and the detail put into the setting of Mars is phenomenal. It is honestly stunning and almost makes you think "how did they film on Mars?!". Mars' rich red and stark desert is captured in beautifully composed shots and polished cinematography. The 3D adds a layer of depth that really stood out for me. The cast is spectacular. Great performances all round. Some examples that stood out in particular was Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor and even Kristin Wiig who obviously comes from a comedic background naturally fell into her character and gave a solid performance. But overall this movie would be no where without the leading man Matt Damon who is exceptional. He drives this film. When he's on screen you are with him surviving Mars. When the film cuts back from Mars to Nasa back to Mars to Nasa again it doesn't feel boring or that you like a certain plot better, the film meshes and blends well because these characters and actors deliver stellar performances. Which brings into the writing. The writing is witty, smart and without a doubt hilarious. This movie could have been mopey and very emotion-driven throughout, the film has time to fit in humour here are there and it works! Watney seems to find the funny side in his situations and I had numerous good laughs. I did not expect the film to be this funny and it'll come as a pleasant surprise to people. You are rooting for Watney the entire film. Damon's performance accompanied by witty writing makes for a likable protagonist. The supporting cast elevate the emotion of this event and how it effects everyone and all can relate. Beautiful CGI and directing makes for the aesthetic that is the Mars landscape is really one of the main reasons this movie is so good. A classic and unexpectedly groovy soundtrack too make one of the most entertaining and well-rounded cinema experiences this year. You will be cheering in your seat praying for Watney to make it home!The Martian - a hopeful survivalist tale with a good sense of humour I've always had mixed feelings about Director Ridley Scott and his films. Some are fantastic and some..are not. Here he is back once again to exploring a familiar territory ‚Äì space. "THE MARTIAN" truly strikes cinematic gold here with what could be looked as a quasi-instruction manual on how to survive surefire death on Mars. Though this adaptation of Andy Weir's novel (which I haven't yet read) is the best thing Scott has given us in quite some time, he still goes where others have gone before ‚Äì only this time, with a perky, life-affirming attitude. The concept is catchy and simple: While on a mission on Mars, a major storm hits the crew of the Ares III facility causing them to abort and head for their escape rocket. As Commander Lewis (Jessica Chastain), cyber-whiz Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), flight surgeon Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan), pilot Rick Martinez (Michael Pena) and chemist Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie) head out into the vicious winds of Mars where botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit by debris and disappears. The others think he's dead and leave without him. But guess what?! He's alive! And in order to survive he must "science the shite" out of the remaining supplies in a lab that was created to last only 31 days. His wit, scientific know-how and vlogs are what sustain him until the people at NASA ‚Äì including NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), mission director Dr. Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and flight director Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) ‚Äì can figure out how to save him. Add in the back ground techies Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis) &amp; Rich Purnell (Donald Glover) who literally come up with the live-saving idea that make it possible to go back and get their man!! All the while they make this trip to Mars almost scenic as you can almost feel the atmosphere while watching. There are shifts here between humor, heart and suspense which are all handled quite well. Plus the soundtrack..ohhh the soundtrack... with it's precise way that it works in the disco from the made-fun-of play-list of Lewis' ‚Äì with just a sampling is "Waterloo" (ABBA) "Don't Leave Me This Way" (Thelma Houston) and Vicki Sue Robinson's "Turn The Beat Around" ‚Äì is not only truly ingenious but yes, fabulous as well. It hits all the notes at just the right moment in Watney's journey, giving us a look into his in-the-moment feelings in a perfectly stated way. While this film is almost all Matt Damon, his very adequate supporting cast really gives the film a huge boost..along with the fact that it engages us intellectually, but not over the top as they make it all relatable and with a dose of humour I just loved. So it makes it hard to even list the one small unfortunate thing about THE MARTIAN as it's good..really good.. it does stop just one step short of being electrifying. And in this case..that's still not a bad thing. Grade: Btechnically excellent Ridley Scott has a great eye for fashioning self-contained worlds, evidenced in this movie by convincing depictions of both the confines of a spaceship and the vastness of a planet.  THE MARTIAN is solidly entertaining Hollywood fare. How much you enjoy it will be determined to a large extent on whether you're happy to pass a lot of time watching Matt Damon, who is at the centre of it. He's improved as an actor over the years. Pretty dismal in THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY, he was impressive in BEHIND THE CANDLEABRA, and has some fine moments here. The sheer size of the role might even attract an Oscar nomination. But there's something about him I don't get, a hollowness in him somewhere, a lack which doesn't exist in actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Leonardo DiCaprio, who fill the screen with sheer presence, just as De Niro and Pacino did before them, and Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Spencer Tracy...the list is long. Damon has his moments, more than he used to, but he's not in the same league. Provided you can live with that, and some of the clunky dialogue, you'll have a good time with this technically excellent movie.This film is out of this world... It should be on everyone's must see list for 2015 'Hi, I'm Mark Watney and I'm still alive... obviously.'  Walking into the cinema... Can Ridley Scott redeem himself? This is looking good, but skepticism persists.  Overall Rating: 4.5 stars Cinematic rating: 4.5 stars Bigger questions rating: 4.5 stars  From the opening sequence, it is clear that Mars is a desolate and harsh environment. NASA has sent a manned mission to the red planet, but due to a dangerous storm that will threaten her crew, Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) has to decide to leave the place they have temporarily called home. As they attempt to leave during the storm, one of her crew members, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), is hit by flying debris and thought to be dead. Lewis is left with the difficult choice of saving the rest of the crew or searching for Watney. Her choice is to sacrifice one for the sake of the crew and they leave Mars and Watney behind. The next day, the crew mourn their crewman without knowing that he had survived the storm. Back on Mars, the interstellar botanist has to come to terms with the challenges of being left alone on the lifeless planet with meagre food stores and no direct communication with his team or NASA. Through human ingenuity and the desire to survive, he must find a way to connect with the people who think he is dead with the hope of getting home to Earth.  Ridley Scott (Gladiator) is back in true form with The Martian and it is a reminder of this director's brilliance and what keeps his fans coming back with hopeful anticipation. This space journey incorporates whispers of past survival stories like Apollo 13, Gravity and Castaway, but Scott delivers a fresh perspective on this enduring genre. Whether it is on a remote island or in space, experiencing man's ability to survive and the lengths that their fellow humans will go to see these survivors saved is worth the price of admission. Scott manages to bring together a talent pool of actors that provide the right balance of believable performances and drama to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Jeff Daniels, Michael Pe√±a, Kristen Wiig and Chiwetel Ejiofor help to lead out a stellar cast that make for a perfect mix of characters, but ultimately, this is Matt Damon's film. His strength of character, unassuming intelligence and dry wit help to drive this story and keep it from turning into an arduous experience. The unwavering belief that he is a botanist and an astronaut provides the needed tenacity, brains and borderline arrogance to make his survival plausible. The trick for the director is to bring the audience along on the journey and make us believe Mark Watney is on Mars and providing enough hope that this space explorer can make it home. Scott manages to balance effective cinematography with a well- crafted script and the right support characters to make this unbelievable tale believable for the audience.  The difficulty in writing a review like this is trying to balance the review with potential drawbacks. The struggle is finding any. The Martian may not appeal to those who need excessive car chases or gun fights to keep their attention and the language is meant for mature audiences, but none of these elements weaken the overall entertainment value. This is an exceptionally compelling ride and should be on the must see list of anyone who enjoys good cinema.  The survival genre is ripe with points of conversation about the human condition. In a film like The Martian, the cost/benefit analysis of saving this one man's life does not make any sense. Saving this one man's life does not seem to justify the expense involved, but it shows how others are willing to risk their physical lives and livelihoods to bring Mark Watney home. Why? Some might say it is the sheer will to live, but it has to go deeper than that, because death is a natural part of life. The answer goes beyond being merely a learnt trait or evolutionary instinct. Mankind seems to be internally wired with a hope for the future. Hope for this life and even something beyond this life. The challenge is considering where this hope originates and how there can be any hope for the future. Is it in science or love of your fellow man or could it be in God? If you were challenged by the film, here is a real challenge, take time to read through Romans in the Bible to see where hope can truly be found for this life and beyond.  Leaving the cinema... On all levels, this is one of the best films of the year. A must see in 2015.  REEL DIALOGUE: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible say about hope? (Jeremiah 29:11, Roman 8:24-25) 2. Why do we care about other's survival? (Matthew 25: 35-40, 1 Peter 3:15) 3. What does this life have to offer? (Ecclesiastes, The gospel of John) Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews #themartianHere's the rub: this is one of the most enjoyable films of 2015. Ridley Scott is truly back to form with this fun, intellectual, charming, well-constructed picture. Admittedly I advent read the book so this review will, unlike others, be of the movie as opposed to an essay on how it contradicts the book or isn't faithful to the source material or whatever.  Matt Damon brings the perfect blend of charm and emotion to this unique character. It's hard to imagine how any human would react in the situation our protagonist Mark Watney is put in - being stranded on a deserted planet 140 million miles away - yet he is able to put in a performance which is heartfelt at times and emotionally driven yet enjoyable and entertaining to observe. The support cast for this flick encompasses overkill in the best way possible. Daniels, Wiig, Ejifor, Bean, Glover, Chastain, Stan... I've undoubtedly left a supreme acting talent out and how sure I am of this is a testament to how many strong performances assured that the audience's interest, when the story was not focusing on Watney's survival, was not squandered. The story is what is promised in the trailer. A male astronaut is stranded on Mars after a mission goes awry and the aftermath regarding how, when and why he should be rescued is the backdrop of the film. Switching between how NASA deals with the situation and how Watney is processing his situation, mixed in with excellent pacing due to brilliant editing and directing allows for a dull moment to be nowhere in sight.  Finding a gripe in this film is difficult. It hits all the right notes and it's charm especially is what will surprise and ultimately please the majority of audiences. The occasional slow moment exists but does not bog down the film by any means. I personally have a slight issue with the final scene but all reviews are subjective and it's highly possible that i'm in the minority in thinking this.  The cinematography and visuals are breathtaking. I would highly recommend seeing this film on the biggest screen possible in 3D. The only thing I can think of being more difficult than NASA actually pulling off a mission such as this would be thinking of someone I couldn't recommend this film to. It ticked all the right boxes and was most definitely one of the most well paced, intellectually stimulating, charming and enjoyable films this year.Potential not reached Non-spoiler review. Having seen an early screening here in the UK, The MARTIAN was one of my most anticipated movies this year. Sci Fi is one of my favourite genres and its great we get a big budget space epic for the 3rd year in a row after Gravity and Interstellar before it. I wasn't a big fan of Ridley's last 2 movies Prometheus and Exodus Gods and Kings, both had great potential but failed to deliver. The MARTIAN unfortunately for me falls into the same zone. It is a better film no doubt than those 2 and the quality of characters /story is much more simpler and coherent but it doesn't reach the full potential I hoped it would. I have read a lot of comments from reviewers before watching it saying the film plays it safe and its clear to the viewer as the film progresses (I haven't read the book). The premise of the plot is straightforward and easy to pick up and it provides the viewer with clear audible dialogue and exposition behind the motives of every action that Matt Damons character undertakes. The science behind the set pieces which form the pillars of the film are accessible to understand for the most part. The visuals are aesthetically pleasing to the eye, especially the terrain of Mars and some shots of the spaceship floating through space, I would say the 3d did enhance these scenes.  However without revealing spoilers, I just didn't become invested in the plot to care enough at the end. The film relies heavily on a formula which is pretty much, problem arises, problem solved, problem arises, problem solved, etc. There are 1 or 2 dues Ex machina moments which come out of the blue simply to drive the plot forward. In this sense the film starts becoming noticeably predictable as it runs its lengthy 2hr 15min course. I felt the dramatic moments on the script should have been focused more on how NASA and the crew debate the ethics of risking 6 astronauts and billions of dollars in space tech against the possibility of saving 1 stranded astronaut 50 million miles away. Overall it's an enjoyable movie, with dry humour and some neat moments throughout illustrated brilliantly by the acting of Matt Damon, but ultimately isn't the thrilling, edge of your seat, tension mounting space epic I was hoping it would be. For me Interstellar is the much better comparison and I would say Gravity is about par if not slightly better than The MARTIAN. Final rating 7/10.Sir Ridley! More gravitas than Gravity! More stellar than Interstellar! After sleeping through Gravity and laughing through Interstellar, (a fine unintentional comedy if ever there was one), it's good to see a contemporary Sci-fi tell the story well - and do the science right. I am not a big Matt Damon fan, mainly because of his loudmouthed lefty nonsense and his limited acting range, but he was very good in this. The support cast were also excellent, especially the always compelling black guy who I can't spell the name of and Harry Dunne. There was some unfortunate pandering by Sir Ridley to the PC brigade, which the film could have done without. The Gen-Y unhygienic (accurate), disorganised, (accurate), disrespectful (accurate), black guy, who also happened to be an astrodynamics genius rocket scientist, (inaccurate), was a poor casting choice. Also to suggest the Chinese would give a fat rat's crack about an American astronaut....at the expense of their state rocket-technology secrets....is laughably far-fetched. Probably more far fetched than flying into space in a roofless/windowless capsule. But putting the film's failings aside, at least Ridley told a good story, laced it with plenty of well-explained science, spliced it with genuine humour and soaked it in amazing vistas of the Martian landscape. Plus he showed that if you put a woman in charge of a dangerous mission, she will ultimately fail. This degree of honesty is refreshing, in an age where every second antagonist is a flimsy female (beating up men ten times her size), or a female weapons expert/assassin/whatever. Show em as they are, Ridley. Well done. All in all a great film where I expected a load of boring tripe. 8/10.The best film I've seen in quite some time! The best film I've seen in quite some time! Which given that so far (admittedly from the limited number of his films I've seen) I'm certainly not classified as 'a Ridley Scott fan', is saying something. A superb film with brilliant characters, excellent acting, a great soundtrack, incredible cinematography, genuinely funny moments and a 2h 20m+ plot that has you hooked throughout and at no point checking your watch! Really difficult to find anything you can fault with this movie! Having seen both films it's inevitably going to be compared to: Gravity &amp; Interstellar, I feel I'm in a position to compare - and on first viewing (watched them all once, and at the cinema) this one knocks the socks off Gravity and encompasses the 'wow' factor of Interstellar but with a much more 'human' plot which is far easier to connect with. I bet the book is a fantastic read, but even without actually reading it I'm guessing this is a really good adaptation which helps bring the pages to life. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to experience what cinema is all about: taking us out of our ordinary lives and whisking us away for 2 hours or so... And realistically who's going to the cinema not wanting that...?very impressive! just got back from an advance screening. Wasn't quite prepared for the ride. I am not a fan of Matt Damon's work on film, but found him very effective as the lost astronaut on Mars who has to survive. I was never bored, frequently on the edge of my seat, and the dialogue was extremely witty. Once the credits rolled and I saw the name "drew goddard" , all the dark and twisted comedic aspects of the film made sense. (Goddard did "the cabin the woods.") This is a real crowd pleaser, with everyone rooting for Matt to come home. Most of us actually clapped at the end of the film. How many movies make you want to do that? The 3D is VERY effective.. I would recommend seeing it in 3d. 9 out of 10. One of Ridley Scott's best efforts.Further proof that Ridley Scott is at his best when doing sci-fi As a genre, sci-fi quite often provides audiences with both thrilling and thought provoking films. Over the past decade there have been some great entries into the genre from filmmakers such as Christopher Nolan and Alfonso Cuaron however, 2015 sees a director return to form in the genre he made his name in. Ridley Scott is responsible for arguably two of the greatest sci-fi films ever made in Alien and Blade Runner, and while Prometheus may not have been a great prequel to the former in 2012, there is no denying that Scott is at his strongest when working within the genre. The Martian is Scott's latest venture into sci-fi and easily his best film in a while. When astronaut David Watney (Matt Damon) is separated from the rest of his crew as a result of a storm during a mission on Mars, he is presumed dead by both his crew and everyone on Earth.  Stranded on Mars all alone, Watney must find a way to survive the harsh conditions of Mars while trying to communicate with NASA in order to get a rescue mission sent his way. What struck me most about The Martian is that, for a film that runs for nearly two and a half hours, it absolutely flies by. Thanks to Scott's direction, a zippy screenplay from Drew Goddard and a superb central performance from Matt Damon, The Martian has an energy running through it that will make sure the audience doesn't lose an interest. Personally, I could have watched another half an hour of it. The film also finds a perfect combination between comedy and drama, which led to a lot more laughs than I thought it would have. It exceeds in both, leading to an interesting take on the human fight for survival and one of 2015's most entertaining films. Coming to the performance of Damon as the stranded Watney, which has to go down as one my favourites of the year so far, and arguably his best performance to date. Damon sells both the tough and vulnerable sides to Watney, remaining totally watchable throughout, which is important as he shares virtually no screen time with any other actor for the whole film. The supporting cast isn't too bad either with Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Aksel Hennie and Chiwetel Ejiofor all playing a part in making The Martian such an engrossing watch.  The cinematography from Dariusz Wolski impressively captures the scope of just how isolated you could be on a vast planet like Mars while also making sure that Damon remains your main focus. There is also some great choices in music for a soundtrack that accompanies the film in such a fun manner. The Martian doesn't reach the high intensity levels of recent sci-fi films such as Gravity or Interstellar but it doesn't have to. For an entertaining slice of sci-fi at the cinema, The Martian is the film for you. I will definitely have to make time to read the novel this is adapted from.Emotionally and viscerally thrilling, this outer space survival story has as much humour and heart as spectacle, and is easily Ridley Scott and Matt Damon's best work in years As tempting as it may be to compare 'The Martian' with 'Interstellar', the two couldn't be more different ‚Äì and we mean that in a good way. Whereas Christopher Nolan's sci-fi odyssey got (literally) lost in space with its own quantum physics, Ridley Scott's stranded-on-Mars survival story stays rigorously grounded for pretty much its entire duration, relying on hard science and good ol' human ingenuity to pull off a high-concept premise with ambition, derring-do and genuine heart. It is less fiction than fact, but that doesn't stop it from easily being Scott's best film in recent years.  Scripted by Drew Goddard from computer programmer-turned-author Andy Weir's best-selling novel, it chronicles the ensuing days of a NASA botanist named Mark Watney (Matt Damon) in the aftermath of a sandstorm that forces his fellow Ares III crewmates to abort mission and head back to Earth, assuming because of a freak accident that he has been killed. Because his communication equipment has been damaged, Mark's best hope in getting back to Earth is to wait four years for the next manned mission to arrive ‚Äì that is, if he can survive that long. Mark's challenge is twofold ‚Äì one, he has to make enough food in order to last 400 sols; and two, he has to drive 3,200 km across Mars terrain to get to the Schiaparelli crater where Ares IV is expected to land. Undaunted, Mark decides to overcome his first by growing his own food, an arduous feat which entails using recycled human waste to make fertiliser and burning hydrazine fuel to create water, in the hope of farming the potatoes meant for the crew's Thanksgiving dinner. As for the latter, well let's just say that the two Rovers which the crew left behind would need to do the trick. Unbeknownst to Mark, NASA is quite aware that he is alive, thanks to an eagle-eyed NASA technician (MacKenzie Davis) who spots activity at the Ares III Hab ‚Äì though not before the presumed dead astronaut is duly mourned. Leading the rescue mission is the head of NASA Terry Sanders (Jeff Daniels), the team comprising of the head of PR Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig), head of Mars missions Venkat Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor), flight director Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) and director of the Jet Propulsion Lab Bruce Ng (Benedict Wong). It is Venkat who surmises from Mark's movement patterns that he is attempting to use the unmanned Pathfinder lander to communicate with NASA, thereby allowing both parties to have a direct line to each other. Not to give anything away to those who have not read the novel, it suffices to say that a freak accident forces a change of plans to retrieve Mark sooner than previously planned, the eventual rescue effort both an unlikely collaboration between two distrusting world powers as well as a demonstration of the selflessness of Mark's former crew members (played by Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan and Aksel Hennie). Those who have read the book however will notice that Goddard has whittled and condensed some of the details to give the film a leaner but much punchier narrative, and perhaps most significantly, abandoned the use of Mark's video logs which Weir had used in his novel as a framing device. Quite astoundingly though, Scott's film loses none of the intimacy of its source material in portraying Mark's personality and emotional psyche. That is as much credit to Scott's ability to translate Goddard's writing into a spare but effective character study as it is to Damon's warm, sincere and effortlessly winning performance. Much of the movie is held together by Damon and Damon alone, and the actor hits the character beats perfectly with just the right balance of optimism and cynicism to pull off the good dose of wry humour that made Mark such an engaging person in the first place. It isn't difficult to root for someone in Mark's circumstance, but Damon captures his character's hopes, fears, disappointment and helplessness in such a tangible manner that it is hard not to feel an intimate connection with Mark. On that same note, there is also much humanity in the interactions between the staff at NASA headquarters as well as Mark's former crew on board the Hermes spacecraft. It is pleasantly surprisingly that the former is devoid of any political agenda ‚Äì even a controversial key decision which Terry makes midway into the film is less out of expediency than a genuine concern of the risks involved ‚Äì and the latter, like we said earlier, proves a rousing display of team spirit. As much as there is spectacle to be had in seeing the execution of a rescue mission of a man on Mars, Scott roots his film in the heart of the people involved in the process, such that the suspenseful climax delivers not just a thrilling send-off but an emotional payoff. Yes, it is pretty much a given that 'The Martian' will boast of Scott's striking visuals, and even with such heightened expectations, the 77-year-old filmmaker doesn't disappoint. Together with his 'Prometheus' cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and production designer Arthur Max, Scott makes the most of the picture's Wadi Rum filming location to create awe-inspiring images of one man against a harsh inhospitable environment, conveying both scale and isolation in breathtakingly elegant frames.  That Scott is still able to astound us with his vision of space is in itself a notable achievement, but 'The Martian' stands out as one of his best films for being much more than spectacle. This is a celebration of the triumph of wits and will against the odds, especially notable in its generous dose of humour and whimsicality. It is also tonally an uncharacteristically upbeat film from Scott, and a befitting shout- out to NASA and the brave men and women who have left our planet to find our place amongst the stars.Excellent film to learn We watch lot of films and read stories about scientists going to other planets for research. I think the way we watch the films and read the stories, it just for thrilling entertainment. We never take the message about how people spend the energy and resources to go to other planets and end up in tragedy and it's all about just surviving with energy and resources we use from earth. We use lot of energy and resources from earth to bring back those people safely to earth. We read stories and watch films like aliens come to earth. Some of the alien life fights against human life. Some of the aliens are very powerful naturally. I am sorry mentioning this. It's our life style to invade all other places for resources. Once we suck resources and destroy the place, we will try to find some other place.Science Porn The Martian quickly begins with the crew aborting their mission and abandoning Mark Watney after being hit by a debris during a storm on Mars, presuming he was dead. And for this impression, this introduction seems sort of contrived, but this film happens to be one of those that gets better and better. As we see this lone astronaut stand up and try to grow plants on this lifeless planet. Everything comes to life when it's just scrutinizing the protagonist's survival on Mars and NASA's rescue mission for him with a delightful dose of science and humor. People might be bragging for more atmosphere of oblivion around this environment, but apparently, it's actually not needed. The upbeat tone of the film is a terrific choice. Not everything has to be a tragedy, The Martian aims to make science look fun and it triumphs from top to bottom. Survival films like this tend to be about self-discovery, life regrets or other personal ordeals, but how this astronaut deals with his own situation is applying his skills; which is botany. So he strategically find ways to grow plants out of potatoes which were stored in their base for food, by collecting soil and fertilizer, even producing water out of chemistry. It's gripping stuff. But the science doesn't stop there; the plot shifts to NASA finding out Watney is still alive and trying to gain contact to rescue him. This rescue plan also consists plenty of scientific strategies; you still won't find any villain in this point, either. Because they're facing the same conflict as the stranded astronaut, which is the probability of failing, even if they carefully planned their ideas. Because every experiment could go wrong, even in something as simple as planting potatoes in a foreign planet. While much of it is discussing their plans and studies, the movie never becomes boring, mostly because it establishes its own personality; especially with its main character. Maybe if the movie is only about Mark Watney surviving on Mars, it would still be a pretty good film, because this character is given a real down-to-earth charisma and Matt Damon justifies all of it. Even when he is just talking for his log explaining his experiments or just driving a rover, it's already a quite entertaining movie to sit through. But having the full story is just equally as important as the Mars alone, because even outside the planet, the other characters are also given enough humor and witty dialogue to make their scientific explanations entertaining to watch. The supporting cast is filled with excellent talents as well that definitely helped making their every moment quite engrossing as Damon's. Of course, the movie doesn't lack impressive visuals, and this merit now comes from Ridley Scott's direction. We've come across with some ambitious space movies in the last two years; either it showcases amazing CGI or amazing practical craftsmanship, but here, those technical methods don't matter. It could be just balance. The simple exterior of Mars already looks impressive in detail, even the scenes in space where how it breathtakingly shoots the interior of the spaceship, it creates an exciting scale of adventure with these angles. There's many to be dazzled here visually, even without acting like an ambitious technical magnum opus. The direction also sharply displays their practicalities which makes every detail easy to comprehend from the fast pace. And the chaotic results of their plan can either be depicted with realism or just a thrilling ride. The Martian's straightforwardness is what made it utterly interesting and supremely entertaining. There is no personal life dilemmas involved in the Mars scenes or any cynical commentary at the NASA side. They're all seeking for the same goal, facing the same problem; they just want the crew to come home. And this doesn't need anything more than their knowledge. Some people might be looking for any sense of humanity in this realm of scientific jargon, and luckily, this movie has plenty of it: isn't Watney's determination of surviving enough? Or his constant sense of humor? How about his loyalty to his crew or everyone's longing of having them return to Earth and reunite with their loved ones; even if the latter is only briefly explained, it's already crystal clear, even without putting up any inspiring monologues or pickup lines. How these characters do their work is already uplifting, anyway. And of course, the soundtrack! Everything else, it's just human beings dealing with nature and time outside their own atmosphere. Their deliberately scrutinized plans are fifty-fifty in this cruel world. It's everything you would ask for in a smart Sci-Fi movie. Its flavor just made it more exciting.A monumental cinematic achievement The year's not over yet but if I were to form a list today, THE MARTIAN most definitely takes the top spot. It's the best movie of 2015 and quite frankly, it's the best Ridley Scott movie since "Gladiator." It's no secret that I found Scott's movies to have been quite disappointing over the past fifteen years or so, "Kingdom Of Heaven," "Body Of Lies," "Robin Hood," "Prometheus" for example ‚Äî they just existed ‚Äî they didn't leave a mark nor carry a lot of weight. But I had hope that the director who gave us such classics as "Alien," and "Blade Runner" would return to his form and I find that in THE MARTIAN. Based on Andy Weir's outstanding debut novel and adapted by Drew Goddard ("Cloverfield," "Cabin In The Woods") Oscar winner Matt Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney who's a member of the NASA crew that explores the planet Mars. A storm forces them to leave their mission but a debris hits Watney and he's presumed dead as his fellow crew members leave him behind. But surprise! Wanted survives, he must now figure out how to continue to survive on that desolate planet where nothing grows and his food supplies are dwindling while at the same time figure out how to make contact with NASA. Mark Watney relies on his wit, his botany skills, his courage and his strong determination to get through each day as NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring him home. What's funny about this is that a couple of years ago, Alfonso Cuaron's "Gravity" was also the best movie of that year in my book, and last year, Matt Damon played a character in Christopher Nolan's "Interstellar" that somewhat went through a similar situation as his "The Martian" character, Mark Watney although they're not exact copy. But the point is, THE MARTIAN, at the heart of it, is a survival movie, just like any other survival movies you've seen about one person stranded on some island or some deserted place. What makes THE MARTIAN unique is that it's unlike any other sci-fi movies, mostly because author Andy Weir impressively did his best to make every aspect and every element of this film as accurate as possible. The extensive research is remarkable. In addition to that, the film feels like a series of solving math problem, one after another. Every time there's a glimmer of hope, a problem comes along and complicates the situation again, but it only pushes the characters to brainstorm, to think outside the box and reach out to other help. THE MARTIAN is a monumental cinematic achievement. From the story to the performances to the production design to the VFX, to the editing to every little detail of technical standpoint, everything about this film embodies excellence. It gives us what "Interstellar" could not, because Nolan's movie meant well, but the concept unfortunately trumped its story whereas "The Martian" has them go hand-in-hand. And perhaps some audiences might view this movie as a bit political especially with the scenario of NASA getting assistance from China's space program, but I think anybody from any background could view that as basic morality, the things that we humans could accomplish if we were to focus on a common goal instead of making it be only about a space race. It's amazing that even some smart nerd in Pasadena could bring positive contribution or an idea to the table. The movie is about a collaboration of all these people just to bring one man home, so it's more or it's a much bigger picture than just about Matt Damon's Mark Watney. THE MARTIAN is epic in every sense of the word, it will make you applaud at the end, it deserves a standing ovation. I hope THE MARTIAN would reignite today's generation's interest to once again dream big and look to the skies. Not everybody is going to be an astronaut or work for NASA's plan of someday putting a man on Mars, but personally, I think films like THE MARTIAN, stories such as this, solidify what I've always strongly believed to be true, science is sexy.Ridley: oh dear Ridley Scott has a superb track record and I have seen nearly all of his films.  I read The Martian and eagerly anticipated the movie. A strange disappointment. There is so much that is good (landscapes, the cast, much of the science) but the one thing missing, the key ingredient, is tension. The book achieves that by introducing cloud cover as our hero approaches his destination (bringing battery life to a halt) as well as car crashes, electrical failures, communication breakdowns with Earth and much else. Not in the film.  Why not? Was there so much else which needed to go in? Not really. Earth scenes of NASA arguments, news conferences and cheering were hammed up.  Could do better, Sir Ridley - or was that your last film?Lukewarm fun spaceride on mars Not the best, not what I had expected, and far less than what I had hoped for. Lots of detail missing and lots of dramatic high points omitted making Martian feel like a outta space roadtrip. You never really feel like he is gonna die and even the problems that arise are not given he gravitas they deserve and the solutions that Watney come up with are made to feel like "any average joe" can accomplish it. In reality, what he does is an absolute feat of near future science, engineering and sheer human willpower and ingenuity. As most book to move conversions go, this one is fairly faithful hence the 6/10. I saw The Verge complain about the ending, but comparing the ending of the movie ending to the monologue ending in the book, the book's was far more moving. And the book's ending monologue was used for the promotional material for the movie but not in the movie itself... how dumb! In the end, they left out the almost getting lost in the sandstorm and the rover overturning, two highly tentative moments in the books. One of the most interesting things about the book was the humor and the humor as a result of Mark's comments in his logs, most of which didn't make it into the movie. i.e when he repaired the machine that recycles water and how he does it and the way he interacts with NASA when they tell him don't touch it. (This didn't make it into the movie btw) Its not a bad movie, but it fails to be the great movie it should have been.Decent SF, not a big cinema experience! Went to the cinema today with the highest hope. Movie is a real SF experience. That means a lot of science that is very possible on Mars. And that is the best part of it. It is not a great cinema experience - it's slow, you can anticipate the next move and the end. The main character should be better developed especially in the emotional area. The only strong feelings that you can see are about the food and the disco music. Not a lot of introspection about solitude, anger and fear from death. The story could be a nice TV series where they could develop the story much better and in details. Visually you can really enjoy the red Mars scenery. That part is truly magnificent. Digitally accurate perspectives of the Martian surface are to die for.Not just another space adventure With the novel being already quite famous, The Martian was already surrounded by a good vibe. The movie delivered what exactly the trailer promised. With Ridley Scott in the director's chair hardly few things could go wrong (forget exodus;-)). Narration and screenplay play a major part in this movie. Visual effects are a plus point especially in the climax sequence which is shot to perfection.  The plot is hardly anything more than what is shown in the trailer. Matt Damon gets stranded in mars after a NASA expedition gone wrong. With the crew on another mission, its up to Matt Damon and his intelligence and experience to survive in mars until the rescue arrives. There is a whole lot of tongue in cheek humour in the movie which keeps the audience interested. Though there are a few over the top and cheeky sequences, the screenplay is pretty decent. There is a whole lot of science and biology involved to satisfy the nerd brains. In time to come there might be articles pointing out the scientific inaccuracies but lets face it no science movie can be perfect. The movie does not go overdramatic like other science fiction by trying to introduce an antagonist role when there is no need of one which is the biggest plus point.  The star cast of this film is pretty huge and is bound to attract a huge number of audiences. Many of them get a very little screenspace as expected. Matt Damon appears in a very cool role after a long gap. Chiwetel Ejiofor has a major role and he reminds us of his '2012' performance. Jeff Daniels has nothing much to do apart from keeping a stern face. I felt Jessica Chastain role could have been written better. Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sebastian Stan , Kristen Wiig and Aksel Hennie just increase the star power. Oh and BTW, Sean Bean lives;-) The only downside of the movie is it is a bit lengthy. But the movie is awesome enough to go and have a nice Mars experience.Ridley Scott back on form After delivering space epics like "Alien" and sci-fi classics like "Blade Runner", Ridley Scott is back top of his game in what is his best film since Gladiator and possibly the aforementioned Alien. The Martian is not the film you might expect from Scott, the man who for the better part of the last decade has had films rife with clunkiness. I was amazed at how tonally the film never puts a foot wrong. It's pitch perfect, no pun intended. Everything in the film is juggled and distilled with a precise purpose of how it affects the mood of the piece. Nothing is extraneous. It doesn't compromise any of its many intertwining elements. It doesn't sacrifice its aims for adding humour, suspense, character definition if anything they add to it. The biological, chemical and mathematical elements crucial to the plot are captivating because they're so carefully infused and engrained with this tone Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard have created. It's funny, intense and everything in between because it of how well-crafted the film is. For such an enormous cast, Scott gives them all their moments to shine. It's an ensemble piece in every sense of the word with Matt Damon being the anchor that holds it all together. The soundtrack is the cherry on top. You would really have to go digging, or snark up big time to find problems or flaws. It put a smile on my face that still hasn't left. A wondrous joy. Sublime stuff Mr. Scott. More where that came from, please.  P.S. Never has an Abba track been so elegiac. I never thought I would type those two words in the same sentence.Superb Adaptation of the Novel I saw this last night at its opening. I was stunned by the book, but curious how they would pull off a movie given the book is basically the thoughts of one man stranded on Mars. This is not a story set in the future, but our own present day. We have the technology to send a manned mission to Mars but we lack the political will. Unlike Apollo 13, which bored me to tears, this movie is just captivating. The human interest is beautifully balanced with the technical aspects (many of which have quite rightly been edited out from the over-technical novel). Apollo 13 lost itself in trying to follow the wives' stories, which were all painfully dull. This film sticks to Mark Watney on Mars and the NASA scientists (geeks) trying to bring him home. The characters at NASA are brilliantly portrayed. This is a book written by a geek for geeks, in a world where clever scientists rock, but it also strikes a chord in the heart of anyone who loves storytelling and heroics. As to the cinematography...this will leave you speechless and forgetting it's actually just a movie. Quite wonderful. Do not miss this movie on the big screen.Fun, thrilling and beautifully directed This is a hugely exhilarating, entertaining and captivating film. With top performances from everyone in the stellar ensemble cast, beautiful direction from Ridley Scott, a consistently intense plot and a great sense of humour, this is such an enjoyable movie to watch. So, let's start with the most pleasing part of this film: the fact that Ridley Scott is really back on form. The man who made classics like Alien and Blade Runner should never have lost credibility in the way he has done in recent years thanks to a string of very poor- performing films, but The Martian is a timely reminder why Scott really is one of the all-time greats of directing. The Mars landscape in this film is one of the most beautiful and pristinely shot I've ever seen on the big screen, effortlessly drawing you in and convincing you so well. In effect, this film literally transports you to another world, as this man's terrifying ordeal on a planet millions of miles away from Earth is just so incredibly captivating. Following on from that, the performances here are all very impressive. Matt Damon is fantastic in the central role, brilliantly combining his character's clear fear of the situation as well as his maverick, upbeat attitude to everything, which makes him an absolute joy to watch. Alongside Damon, there is a plethora of A-listers, including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean, Michael Pe√±a and Kate Mara, and all of them are excellent. Everyone puts in an energetic show that corresponds perfectly to this film's brilliant blend of intense emotional drama and hilarious comedy. Seriously, this film is really funny, and although the level of humour never detracts from the intensity of the plot, the fact that there is often such a light-hearted vibe to it all (helped from time to time by a bizarre but oddly perfect 70s soundtrack) makes it such an enjoyable film to watch, adding to the excitement of the story all the more. So, now the story. This is yet another piece of this movie that works sublimely, as the screenplay is filled with fascinating dialogue throughout, and the overall premise of the plot is hugely enticing. Based on Andy Weir's book, the story is always exciting, full of action and genuinely unpredictable suspense. It's said a lot, but this film, more so than anything I can remember in recent years, is totally unpredictable. There is nothing that even gives you a whiff of whether Matt Damon will live or die in the end, and that is massively impressive. Finally, the plot is also filled with great emotional drama. Again, it's not so heavy that the movie loses its fun factor, but it really works well at certain points throughout, bringing incredible poignancy to such an entertaining film.Of Miraculous Science and Sheer Human Ingenuity In truth, The Martian's sentiments may come across as old-fashioned and impossibly conservative. The film's notions subsist in a territory less explored in the ever expanding immensity of the space sci-fiction genre, somehow deviating from the category's more standardized form, but it makes a clear point, one that strongly testifies to humanity's incredible capacity to survive. The hero is Matt Damon's Mark Watney, who, after presumed dead by the rest of NASA's Ares 3 crew, was left in Mars, alone in the hostile red planet. He has at least four years to endure before a possible rescue mission arrives. But with limited rations left that may be good for only a few months, and persistent fatal conditions around him ever present, the witty Watney decides to "science the sh!t out of it" for him to survive, declaring he is the planet's greatest botanist, after all. For most of his chunk of the screen time, Watney shares his daily struggle in seemingly endless monologues through a confessional Vlog, running through diverse subjects that go from things as random and simple as Donna Summers to those of unfathomable scientific and mathematical depths, like thermodynamics and hexadecimals. And if you're not really into such stuff, you would thank him for throwing punchlines every now and then, which sometimes may be corny and flat, but nonetheless enough to keep us away from getting bored. And with the rest of the cast mostly standing in front of screens monitoring him,y Damon singularly shines throughout the picture. That's not to say the rest of the frame is invaluable, but Watney's struggle itself creates an emotional connection between the worlds, relaying a cathartic sentiment that the audience would impossibly not relate to. This may not be your no.1 sci-fi film, no thanks to a not- so- impressive finale, a bunch of supports whose functions mostly never go past just being stare-at-the- monitor standees, and some persistent logical leaps in the narrative, but it should be enough to shake up your list. Not only it pays with utmost reverence to science, it also explores its endless possibilities, which may not be within our grasp at the moment, but still scientifically possible. With all that said, 'The Martian' is an exquisite cinematic gem, its sentiments reminiscent of familiar campaigns pulled off by countless previous films aiming to enforce humanity and its miraculous capacity. It's a celebration of human spirit and our species' ingenuity. And while everybody's abuzz about the recent discovery of existence of water in the red planet and the possibility it might be capable of supporting life, 'The Martian' has somehow delivered a compelling argument about how the planet probably can, one I believe, is worth checking out.It's hard to imagine Ridley Scott directing a film like this one.... Ridley Scott is famous for bringing "Alien" and "Bladerunner" to the big screen. Both have huge followings and both are amazing for their time when they were made. Now with "The Martian" he brings a great sci-fi film to us but one with an entirely different mood--so much so that it's hard to believe it's from this famed filmmaker! Why? Because the mood is so much more positive and upbeat--and it's a film that leaves you happy...something you could never say about the other movies! As far as what I liked about the film and what I disliked, I'll make it easy--especially since there are already so many reviews for the movie. What I liked was everything and I hated nothing. There is nothing I would have done differently...and that's something I almost never can say. This is a very intelligent, crowd-pleasing quality picture from start to finish and you should see it on the big screen if you can. Yes, it's THAT good!Technically Great and a Wonderful Performance by Damon The Martian (2015) *** 1/2 (out of 4)  On a mission to Mars a crew of astronauts get caught in a brutal storm when one member, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit with an object and apparently killed. The commander in charge (Jessica Chastain) decide to leave the planet and NASA must announce that Watney has been killed but soon they all discover that he survived. Now Watney must find a way to try and survive on the planet with a lack of food and water. Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN is an extremely entertaining movie and it's easy to see why it became such a box office hit. The idea of a man being trapped on a different planet and having to decide whether he wants to live or die is such a simple idea and there's no question that Scott knows how to handle drama and tension in space. The film has a very good story to draw you in but I'm not going to lie and say I didn't have any problems with the movie but more on that in a bit. A lot of credit certainly goes to Scott who handles the material extremely well and most importantly is the fact that he makes you believe that this man is actually trapped on Mars. If the viewer thought they were just looking at a set or just some fake CGI then it would pretty much kill the story. By Scott creating a real environment you have no problem believing that you're seeing a man trapped on a planet with his closest help millions of miles away. On a technical level the film contains some wonderful cinematography, a great and rousing score and of course brilliant sound effects and set designs. Damon's excellent performance is another very important factor because we need an actor who we're not only going to believe in the part of a brilliant astronaut but we also must be entertained by him and care for him. Damon certainly makes you believe that he's this brilliant mind and there's no question that his one-man-show is something the actor nails. We get a strong group of supporting players including a very good Chastain plus strong work from Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Donald Glover and Chiwetel Ejiofor. As I said, I did have some major problems with the film including the fact that it just seems like everything happened way too easily. I understand this is a mainstream movie that couldn't get into great detail because it might confuse or bore the viewer but I just thought the film would have worked even better had it been more realistic. Of course, I'm no space expert so perhaps what happens here is 100% believable. I'd also say that the film is also a tad bit too predictable. Either way, THE MARTIAN is certainly a very good movie.Tasks for your survival Although The Martian is set in an indeterminate future I have questions about labeling it science fiction. One of the film's best strengths is that it is based on what we know about the landscape and atmosphere of Mars right at this point in time. It's a desert planet with water and no life as we know it. Compared to what Matt Damon has to go through, Robinson Crusoe was on that tropical isle for a picnic. They never really say just exactly what year The Martian is set in. The film in that sense avoids a trap like so many others fall into. Just this past year we saw 2015 come and go and it wasn't really anything like the 2015 that Marty McFly experienced. That's just one example. Of course you can also never predict what popular trends will be there. That's purely speculative. So you can't have Matt Damon's character listening to current music. His captain's taste in music was 70s disco and that really became a running joke. It's all he heard for the months he was on Mars. Personally I'd prefer a selection of 30s and 40s music with Bing Crosby at the top of my list. But if that's all I heard for months on end, I'd grow to hate Der Bingle.  And that's part of the story, the everlasting boredom trying to keep your mind fresh and busy with tasks for your survival. Like Mr. Roberts from tedium to apathy and always boredom. What happens in The Martian is that Damon is part of an astronaut team and gets left behind when a Martian sand storm erupts and the crew flees on the space ship. Captain Jessica Chastain takes when she thinks Damon was killed.  The future also brings us better communication and NASA learns that Matt's still there. To say that there's a public relations problem is putting it mildly. Just leaving him there is actually an option discussed. But that goes against the code of a decent civilization which while we're not at Star Trek level yet, we look to be heading that way. Although The Martian splits time evenly with Damon's plight and the efforts to rescue him, Matt's time alone on the screen with the full range of emotions displayed is what got him his Best Actor nomination. Besides the realistic depiction of Mars, his performance is the other pillar on which this fine film rests. I would give mention to Jessica Chastain and her fine performance as a tough and yet humane leader of her team. Besides Matt Damon, The Martian is also up for Best Picture and for a flock of awards in the technical categories. It should take home deserved statues this year.fun thrilling space adventure The Ares III manned mission encounters a sand storm on Mars. Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left for dead as the rest of the crew evacuate on their spacecraft. Mission control back on Earth is shocked when they discover that Mark is actually alive and alone on Mars. Simply put, this is a fun space adventure. There is a good deal of Apollo 13 and Gravity. Damon is humorous and engaging. Meanwhile, the mission control back on earth is doing interesting things. Nobody is the villain. Jeff Daniels is a capable bureaucratic leader. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives the team intensity and has fun scenes with Mackenzie Davis. Almost every side character adds to the group. As for the spacecraft, it's interesting to have Jessica Chastain as the commander. The entire cast is great. The whole story is thrilling. There are unexpected turns. It has the feel of reality. A lot of praise has to be given to director Ridley Scott for a well constructed film. Also it's genius to give it a disco soundtrack.Entertaining and slick enough to make you go with it I heard a lot about this film regarding its scientific validity as a piece of fiction. Perhaps as a result of this I assumed that the film would be a dry affair ‚Äì an impression sort of confirmed by the longer than normal running time. As it happens, this is not the case at all because The Martian has much more in common with the entertaining blockbuster that the starry cast list and presentation suggest it will be. The story wears its science very much on its sleeve, but yet makes it accessible and fun ‚Äì with the slick presentation making it so. As a result everything seems to be explained with everyday objects, and even the most complex principles are presented in simple terms (references to Iron Man for instance). As a result the film gets to have its cake and eat it ‚Äì although the film is helped by the knowledge of a lot of this being possible (eg hitting a point near Pluto recently with very tight tolerances on a journey of years). The film itself doesn't really play up the drama in a heavy way, but rather does enough to invest the viewer in it without making it too much of a downer or serious. The soundtrack is hugely upbeat, the content is mostly light in tone, and the science is delivered in a very user-friendly fashion ‚Äì essentially in the service of the tone and the entertainment value, nothing more than this. The starry cast add to this feeling, and use their screen presence well. Damon is consistently likable, which is just as well since he is alone in the vast majority of his scenes. The ensemble cast has a lot of depth to it, all of which are solidly watchable ‚Äì Chastain, Wiig, Daniels, Eiofor, Pe√±a, Bean, and so on. The Chinese aspects of the plot serves as another reminder that this film is a blockbuster out to make money, but it doesn't seem too out of place. Technically it looks great and it impressive how convincing the surface of Mars looks. In the end we get to the fist-pumping mission control scenes that we all knew were coming, but along the way the film is slickly packaged and entertaining as a result; even if the oft-mentioned scientific validity of it all is not something it ever seems concerned with itself.Total Lack of Emotion and Suspense During a storm in Mars, the astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit by an antenna and presumed dead by his captain and crew that cannot find him. Captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) seeks him out and decides to departure with her crew. However, he has survived and finds that was left behind short of supplies and without communication to Earth. Mark is botanic and uses his knowledge to plant potatoes in a green house he has prepared. Meanwhile in NASA the scientists find that Mark is alive and try at any cost to bring him back to Earth. Will they succeed? "The Martian" is a film with fantastic special effects and cinematography. However there is a total lack of emotions and suspense and it is hard to understand the hype around this film. Mark Watney seems to be a combination of Robinson Crusoe with MacGyver with his ideas and solutions. However, he never feels depressed or in despair with the loneliness or with his doomed situation. His rescue is a rip-off "Gravity" that is better and better. If the viewer watches this movie with great expectation, he or she will be very disappointed. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "Perdido em Marte" ("Lost in Mars")Quite Possibly the Best of 2015 During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Although at this point I have only seen three of the eight Best Picture nominees, I feel confident in saying that "The Martian" deserves to win. Although Ridley Scott is not nominated for Best Director (odd considering this is his best film in a long time or possibly ever), and the only acting nomination is for Matt Damon (who will likely lose to Leonardo DiCaprio)... this movie nails it on the story alone. By all means, this can win in the Best Adapted Screenplay category, as well. No, I have not read the original book so I do not know what Drew Goddard put into it. And no, I have not seen all the other nominees yet. I suspect "Big Short" is also an excellent script. But again, this film succeeds based on two things: incredible suspense and a strong script. Is all the science strictly accurate? No. Apparently some key things, such as the "fierce storm", are not correct. But we believe it. Everyone speaks as though they know what they say, and unlike "Star Wars" (or even "Star Trek") this is clearly based on reality. In recent years, it seems that a space movie somehow sneaks into the top Academy nominees. After "Gravity" and "Interstellar", we have this. And I dare say they are getting better. "Gravity" was a good exploration of visuals, but not a deep film. "Interstellar" took everything to the next level, even to the point of being a mind-bender. Here, I think we have the perfect balance: hard science and space danger. What could have been two hours of boring, bland scenes of a man in a desert end up being exciting and you can feel the desperation -- and more importantly the endless optimism and hope. The bulk of the film's nominations are in production design, sound and other effects. These are well-deserved, and it may take home a few. Not being an expert, it is hard to judge sound editing. But this is the sort of movie where such a thing can make or break the picture. There will be some strong competition, but the designs of the NASA equipment are impressive and the sounds are excellent. The visual effects are a harder sell, with some of the low-gravity moments seeming a bit off somehow. The takeaway: expect a win or two in the technical categories. Of the bigger awards, Damon is a contender for Best Actor but will not win. Best Adapted Screenplay ought to be a lock, and if it gets nothing else this is the film's strong suit. For my money, "The Martian" has Best Picture written all over it, but the experts are leaning more towards "The Revenant" or "Spotlight"... on that, we will have to agree to disagree.Fun but Far From Great This is certainly an entertaining film as a formula movie. It's fun like the earlier "Independence Day" film with Bill Pullman and Will Smith. We put a poor guy in an untenable situation, trapped on a planet when his colleagues are forced to take off and leave him behind. As a scientist, he does miraculous things to stay alive, including creating a greenhouse where he can grow potatoes (that just happen to be on board providing seed). That's OK. That's a plot element. He also has incredible knowledge of all the incredible stuff left behind on Mars. An amazing rover as well as a nuclear device. That's OK too because we can't have a plot without something for this guy to do. Where it falls down is in the reality of NASA (which we are told are a pack of insensitive boobs or nerds). They are going to do this and then they are going to do that. Jeff Daniels plays a stuck-in-the-mud guy who is only concerned about the politics of the job. I love Matt Damon. I've seen nearly everything he has done. He's adequate in this film but certainly not Academy Award material. He expresses almost no emotions other than a couple little under-control tantrums. What about the loneliness, the sameness of every day? Years of eating potatoes. Anyway, it is candy for those who don't want to think very much. It's very impresstive looking and the special effects are awesome. We've become a bit spoiled, I guess. Things by the formula.An Intelligent Space Thriller These stories of isolated individuals -- "Castaway", "Robinson Crusoe," "Jeremiah Johnson" -- can be difficult to pull off. They can turn banal in a hurry. Poor Thoreau couldn't do a satisfactory job. "First, I felled the small fir, then adzed the bark and trimmed the mesophyllum into rabbits for the lallies."  "The Martian" pulls it off with aplomb, helped greatly by a courageously demanding script from screenwriter Drew Goddard. A cornucopia of plaudits to the guy, and to Ridley Scott for doing a fine job with the direction, and to the performers who are all at the top of their game, especially Chiwetel Ejiofor as a member of the team back on planet earth. The climax is about as tense as it gets. The musical score, alas, is generic. The story is pretty well-known by now. Matt Damon is a botanist, part of an exploratory team on Mars, who gets accidentally left behind. He sets about providing a habitat for himself, much in the manner of a test pilot who has run into troubles. As Chuck Yeager has pointed out, the pilot in distress doesn't panic. He just asks, "What do I do next?" It may sound a little boring but it's not. Damon's Martian doesn't despair. He describes exactly what he's doing to a video recording he intends to leave behind as a record if he dies. We are the video recording device. He's pretty chipper throughout. An experiment goes awry and he presents his injured face to the device and says, "Okay. I blew myself up."  About a third of the movie deals with the team back on earth and with the crew of the Hermes, the space craft that left Damon behind. The commander of the Hermes is Jessica Chastain, whom I admire a great deal. It's not just that she's attractive because she's less like a typical Hollywood glamour queen and more like the pretty women ahead of you in the supermarket checkout line. She has a strong jaw but her pale presence suggests fragility, as if one of her long bones might break if she slipped and fell down. I grovel in wonderment at her nose. It assumes a normal tangent from the plane of her face but at its very tip it forms an impudent little outward projection. Speaking of tangents, that reminds me. Some viewers might find the dialog a little challenging -- velocity in so many meters per second, escape acceleration, "sols" instead of days, Schroedinger's cats or whatever. It didn't bother me a bit. It all sailed completely over my head in the most satisfying way.The Martian From BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Sir Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Prometheus), this cleverly titled space film I debated seeing at first, having average reviews, but I went for it. Basically a temporary artificial habitat called The Hub has been established on the planet Mars by the crew of the manned mission Ares III, they are to stay for 2 months and return to Earth in their orbital probe. However, 6 days into the mission the base is hit by a massive Martian storm and they are forced to abandon and launch themselves, to avoid the escape vehicle collapsing and leaving them stranded. While evacuating, astronaut Mark Watney (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Matt Damon) is hit by a large piece of debris and disappears into the rushing planet dust, he is presumed dead as his biomonitor is damaged, mission commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and the rest of the crew with their lives at stake are forced to leave Mars. Watney has in fact survived the storm and makes it back to the Hab, but he is unable to contact NASA, he calculates that he has 300 days of food, uses his knowledge as a botanist to make a makeshift farm in the central room of the habitat, and anticipates needing to survive at least three years before a return mission to the planet takes place. Mark makes video logs to keep up morale and plans to journey to the landing site of Ares IV, he modifies the rover for capability to travel long journeys. Satellite photos of Mars are received at NASA, engineers Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis) realise Mark is alive, they immediately attempt to establish contact, against the decisions of the Hermes spacecraft flight director Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean), NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) orders that the crew of Ares III, currently travelling back to Earth, are not told. Back on the surface of Mars, Mark finds defunct probe the Pathfinder, he uses it to regain contact with Earth, using the probe camera and signs for a letter coding system, later on Mark establishes real-time text messaging from NASA in the modified rover. As Mark continues to grow his crops, a plan is formulated by crew supervisor Mitch Henderson and JPL director Bruce Ng (Sunshine's Benedict Wong) to send a space probe to Mars to resupply Mark to last up to four years until Ares IV can reach him, Sanders speaks to the press about the discovery of Mark living on the planet, and he authorises Henderson to send a video message to the crew to tell that Watney is alive. But probe inspections are skipped and it explodes during launch, Mark meanwhile suffers his own disaster as the airlock on the habitat malfunctions, it explosively decompresses, his crops are killed, his projected food supply is reduced and he resorts to strict rationing. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) offer NASA a lifeline, a classified booster can carry a payload, this can be sent to Mars to resupply Mark, or resupply the Hermes so that the Ares III can return to the planet and rescue Mark, Lewis and her crew agree to force Sanders to go ahead with the second option, by setting their craft into a gravitational slingshot back to Mars, the resupply mission is successful and the crew begin the return journey. Seven months later, Mark has driven all key life support systems to the Ares IV mission base, he strips down the Area IV launch vehicle (placed on Mars in advance) to save weight, following instructions from Kapoor, his spacesuit will be used to protect against the vacuum of space. The Hermes reach and orbit Mars, the Ares IV is launched remotely, but Mark's vehicle fails to achieve the altitude needed to be intercepted, an explosive device rupturing an airlock to release the ship's atmosphere and generate thrust is improvised to slow the Hermes down without wasting fuel, still too far away Mark makes the drastic decision to pierce his suit hand and use the suit's pressure to come close enough for Lewis to catch him. In the end Mark returns to Earth to begin "day one" of his new life as a NASA safety instructor for new candidates to the astronaut training program, and the crew members watch the news of the successful launch of Ares V. Also starring Kristen Wiig as Annie Montrose, Michael Pe√±a as Rick Martinez, 127 Hours' Kate Mara as Beth Johanssen, Sebastian Stan as Chris Beck, Aksel Hennie as Alex Vogel and Donald Glover as Rich Purnell. Damon as the man trapped on the red planet is a great amiable character, making wisecracks to himself along the way, you definitely want him to be rescued, and there is great support from Chastain, Daniels and Ejifor. If you were to describe this, you could plonk together Cast Away and Apollo 13, but there is a film titled Robinson Crusoe on Mars you could mention as well. What is really good about this film is the choice of music throughout, the lead character is forced to listen to disco tunes, and the choices of songs used are inspired, including "Hot Stuff" - Donna Summer, "Waterloo" - ABBA, "Starman" - David Bowie, and the genius choice is "I Will Survive" - Gloria Gaynor. The first half of the film is really effective with the man, the "martian" of the title (no aliens are ever seen), desperate to survive working for his needs, the middle trails a little with scientific gibberish, but it picks by the last half an hour with the crucial rescue, overall it is a worthwhile science-fiction drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects. Good!a thoughtful, exciting, crowd-pleasing movie about problem-solving It's great to see characters think and actively searching for a solution to a problem. That was one of the driving forces of Apollo 13 (remember, "fit that, with that, using nothing but that"), and other films dealing with survival often have that as a crux of the narrative. But The Martian isn't something where the filmmakers are trying to do a lot with a little dialog, like All is Lost or Cast Away. There are stretches without talking, but not as many as you'd expect; as the audience we're filled in often about what processes are going on and how things keep evolving (or, sometimes, breaking down miserably) in the search for how to keep astronaut/Botanist Mark Watley a) alive and b) bring him back home. It is a splendid piece of big, mainstream entertainment because it really digs in in ways that invite the audience in, while constantly keeping things entertaining and amusing. The Martian is about a man left behind by his crew (not their fault, they genuinely thought he was a goner), and how he has to find ways to stay alive, to give himself food and, most importantly, send word to NASA that he's alive and well and can they maybe send some supplies and oh does the crew know yet? It's got a lot of science to it - as Damon says in the trailer that most have seen, "I'm going to have to science the s*** out of this" - but, more often than not, it's accessible and easy enough to understand. That is, of course, if you're not too scared by science fiction (or, as the filmmaker and actors have talked about in press interviews, science 'fact', as everything, save for us presently going to the moon with men/women on a ship, is plausible).  It's a movie about how to keep humanity in all its dimensions going through the perils of space. And, as we see, space is nothing if not indifferent; it acts, particularly on Mars, as a place where nothing really grows, storms can knock the hell out of things if items or persons aren't fastened tight, and if anything comes loose, watch out for the air and pressure to possibly kill you. On the level of threats, director Ridley Scott and especially screenwriter Drew Goddard (taking, from what I've been told, faithfully from Andy Weir's best-seller), it's high and pretty constant, and there is always that sense even when things are going well that they can break down at any time. While I never thought watching it 'Oh, maybe he won't get back or might die', as the conclusion seems clear since we are meant to like this guy and want to see him live/return, the threats and obstacles are presented expertly, with a lot of excellent pacing giving us breathing room. The 'breathing room' part is what I mean by this being a crowd- pleasing, entertaining flick. Goddard, previously of Cabin in the Woods, is adept at giving actors funny things to say, and The Martian is just good but basic sci-fi without the wit. Some of it may seem obvious - Watley is saddled with one of the other astronauts' musical selection (disco, which he grows to kind of like in a begrudging sort of way) - but a lot of it is due to personality, from him as well as those at mission control (Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, a very funny Donald Glover, Jessica Chastain and Kate Mara are part of what is actually a giant supporting cast). These are serious scientists and people trying to do their jobs in (mostly) responsible ways, but how they talk is closer to how one might see people talk in, say, the real world; this isn't the tone-deaf wit of Prometheus, and it's funnier than what Gravity previously tried to do. I was surprised how much I was laughing during The Martian. But it's deep down a drama, and led by Matt Damon in a performance that makes this director-writer-actor triangle complete for the audience. He has to hold down major chunks of the film, albeit there is a lot with NASA and the other ship with Chastain and so on, and without making this man believable in his serious scientific intellect, his ways of making things light (or cursing, which is interesting that they get away with a PG-13 here by the way through bleeps), and real pathos, the movie won't work, or nearly as well. He delivers up to what the script asks, and it, plus Scott's visual scope and control of the pacing, make this an exceptional Hollywood movie. We get to see how process works in a crisis, and that's always character-building and interesting (when written well) in a movie; that it's at this level of A-list makes The Martian a special film, and one of Scott's best.Stranded on Mars Set in the not too distant future the Ares III mission to Mars has to abort there 31 Sol (Martian day) mission on Sol 18 when a storm hits their base and threatens to topple the rocket that will take them back to the Hermes, the craft that will take them back to Earth. As they run through the storm a piece of debris hits mission botanist Mark Watney. His colleagues try to find him but as his suit's telemetry suggests he is dead they are forced to leave without him. It soon emerges that he is not dead¬Ö unfortunately he calculates that there won't be enough food left for him to survive till the next mission to Mars. Back on Earth everybody thinks he is dead until a satellite photograph shows that the Ares III site has changed so somebody must be there! Still at this point there is no way to contact him. Mark manages to grow potatoes for food and sets about retrieving a transmitter from a previous mission. With contact finally made they start discuss how he might be rescued. Time will be close and there will be setbacks. Fans of 'Hard Sci-Fi' should really enjoy this; the idea of manned mission to Mars might seem many years away the technology we see doesn't seem unrealistic and the story seemed plausible¬Ö so much so that the film this most reminded me of was 'Apollo 13' which was of course based on a real life near disaster in space. The opening set up is effective and wastes little time in stranding Mark on Mars then we get down to the business of him trying to figure out how to survive. He encounters many problems which are resolved logically. Similarly the events on earth appear plausible as first those in charge want to avoid a PR disaster then work to rescue him when it becomes apparent that he is alive. The cast does a fine job. Matt Damen excels as Mark Watney managing to be entertaining even when the only talking he does for much of the time is direct to camera as he records a video diary. The rest of the cast, which includes many familiar faces also impresses. The Jordanian locations used look suitably barren to act as a substitute for Mars. While things are serious for the most part there are some good laughs as well; many provided by the fact that the only music Mark has is some disco taken to Mars my the mission commander¬Ö this provides an excuse for some enjoyably incongruous back ground music which I rather enjoyed. Overall I really enjoyed this and would certainly recommend it even if you don't consider yourself a sci-fi fan."Who am I to talk about loneliness?" As improbable as the story is, it had a certain resonance to my mind about the capacity of the human spirit to persevere and make the best of one's circumstances under the most intolerable of conditions. Faced with the same situation, how many would simply give up and let fate take it's course? The harder thing to do is stretch one's mind and resources in an effort to stay alive and operate from a position of informed intelligence until help arrives. When Mark Watney (Matt Damon) proclaims "I'm not gonna die here", not only do you believe it but you wish there was something you could do to help. That's not to say I didn't find some elements to be just too unbelievable. The real time communication with the rescue team, and especially the sharing of Watney's comments with the rest of the world defied any sort of credibility. China helping pro-actively - I don't think so, at least not in an official capacity. The cracking wise dialog of the crew members was also a little too forced it seemed. You would think there would be some consternation over the plight of the stranded team member. But for a sci-fi film offering a once in a lifetime what if scenario, the picture works well enough to be an entertaining diversion. I can think of worse ways to spend a couple of hours.The Gardener out of space It's almost impossible to not have seen at least glimpses/clips from this movie. But just knowing what this will be about, does not mean you won't enjoy the ride. It may be true with some other movies, but this works quite good. Even though we do know more and are expecting the inciting incident to happen to Matt Damons character. And while everyone else does not know about him and his status, we do know. And I think everyone can at least relate to some parts, when it comes to feeling lonely. Even someone who has a lot of people around him/her, has moments where you only have yourself (to rely upon). And Damon has a lot to do. You could say this is predictable (and maybe has an agenda, depending on the outcome always), but the tension still never lets up. Entertaining and funny too, even when Damon breaks a couple of rules of filmmaking (not talking to oneself, but then again, what else can you do? Plus he's not "just" talking to himself ... well you'll see).Help is only 140 million miles away. For Mark Watney, stranded on Mars. We viewed this on DVD from our public library. Picture and sound are first-rate. The premise is somewhere in the 2030s we have advanced our space exploration to successful missions to Mars. While one is underway a large, unforecast storm comes up on Mars requiring the crew of 6 to cut the mission short and use the escape rocket to blast off and rendezvous with the main space ship orbiting Mars. But one of the crew, Mark Watney, is hit by a large object and carried away, injured and out of communications. Reluctantly they have to blast off without him after a short search was futile. Mark was presumed dead. But Matt Damon as Mark Watney didn't give up so easily, he managed to get himself to a base station and using medical tools and staples repaired his wounds and set about trying to figure out how to survive with limited resources. Fortunately with rations for 6 he was able to make food stretch, and as a Botanist even came up with a method to make water and, using his own waste as fertilizer, used a Thanksgiving package of potatoes to grow potatoes in a chamber converted to a greenhouse of sorts. So much of the movie is about Mark's survival, plus his figuring out a way, using old abandoned Mars exploration robots, to communicate with NASA. The real hard part becomes how to plan and carry out a rescue mission. Mars is far away, it takes a long time, he has limited time to survive. The cast is varied and good, with Jessica Chastain as Melissa Lewis, the commander of the mission. Kristen Wiig in a serious role as a NASA communications officer, Jeff Daniels as Teddy Sanders, the NASA chief, Michael Pe√±a as Rick Martinez, the pilot for the mission, Kate Mara as one of the crew, a computer expert, Beth Johanssen, among others. This is a really good and entertaining movie. It is a serious subject but is treated with appropriate humor.  EDIT: I re-watched it 8 days later and enjoyed it as much the second time! SPOILERS: When the first rescue approach failed in a faulty rocket launch, a young data nerd calculated, using NASA's super computer, that the crew on their way back to Earth could accelerate and using the Earth slingshot return to Mars, but it would require a risky capture of a re-supply module and a never-rehearsed module take-off from Mars to try to capture Watney in a Mars fly-by. NASA said no to the risk but the crew decided on their own to try the rescue. That whole last scene was very tense and of course it was a success.Surviving the loneliness of Mars. Not the most overwhelming thing from director Ridley Scott, but not exactly underwhelming. Commend Drew Goddard for putting Andy Weir's book way out there. Mark Watney (Matt Damon)is an astronaut and superior botanist that finds himself abandoned on the surface of Mars after his crew concludes that he perished in a major dust storm. Watney with his intellect and humor must find a way to survive the harsh planet. His former crew is high-tailing it back to Earth and is not told my NASA command that Watney is planting/growing potatoes and producing water for sustenance. NASA administrator Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) is too embarrassed and ashamed at first to tell the world that the astronaut has been discovered alive by astrodynamics nerd Rich Purnell (Donald Glover) and has convinced space scientist Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) that a rescue is very possible with some major help of international scientists, especially the Chinese space program that has the perfect rocket to get the Herculean effort underway. After being told, his original mission colleagues led by commanding officer Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) are more than ready and able to join in the rescue watched around the world. This film is held together with a soundtrack a bit better than astronaut Watney prefers. Music by the likes of Donna Summer, Abba, The O'Jays, The Hues Corporation, David Bowie and Gloria Gaynor's anthem "I Will Survive". Other cast members featured: Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Mackensie Davis, Askel Hennie, Sean Bean and Kate Mara.Not Brilliant And Not A Musical While exploring Mars an expedition get caught up in a sandstorm and have to beat a hasty retreat leaving behind the body of a dead team member . As it transpires he isn't dead but soon will be as it'll take too long to mount a rescue mission and his supplies will have run out long before then  A return to form from acclaimed director Ridley Scott . Oh hold on I'll use quotation marks because that's not really my opinion "A return to form from acclaimed director Ridley Scott" . I'm afraid I found this rather boring . Matt Damon finds himself trapped on Mars struggling to survive . Early in the film Matt takes off his spacesuit and glancing at his inhuman well buffed torso you know every hetrosexual woman on the planet will want to use him as their own personal lick toy if he makes it back to Earth . Remind me and 3.5 billion other mortal men why we want him to survive this ordeal ?  I'm afraid I'd forgotten his characters name because my disbelief was never suspended long or hard enough to think I was watching a real life character trying to survive a real life situation but more of an actor appearing in a Hollywood movie . "Luckily I'm a botanist so I can grow things" he states. Wow , how fortunate is that ? Very fortunate I'd say and this type of good fortune reminds you you're watching a contrived story . It does try and bring science fact to the narrative but at the same time when you've got the actor who played Boromir in THE LORD OF THE RINGS explain why the rescue mission is called "Operation Elrond" this tends to underline the fact that you're watching a movie  One puzzling thing is that it's picked up several Golden Globe nominations - in the comedy/musical category ? This is ridiculous since the film is in no way a comedy or a musical . Its style is somewhat reminiscent of these films in the 1980s with either a diegetic or non diegetic musical soundtrack blasting away . Anyone consider APOCALYPSE NOW a musical ? I didn't think so . That said I did slightly respect THE MARTIAN more than the rather overrated INTERSTELLAR . It's just that when you compare it the breathtaking achievement of GRAVITY a couple of years ago or the thematically similar THE REVENANT then you'll probably find THE MARTIAN a bit lacklustre in comparison . I also think because of voter politics - Inarritu won best director at the Oscars last year - the Academy Awards might just give Ridley Scott a long overdue Oscar in 2016 , but to be honest he's made better films than this oneA Great Story Of Hope And Optimism Matt Damon stars in this science fiction film that tells the story of an astronaut that was mistakenly presumed to be dead and left behind in the planet Mars entitled The Martian.This film directed by Ridley Scott is based on Andy Weir's novel of the same name.Joining Damon in an ensemble cast are Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pe√±a, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Donald Glover and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Astronaut Mark Watney is part of a NASA manned mission.After a fierce storm,the mission presumed him dead and left him behind after he was presumed to be dead.But with strong will,he managed to survive and finds himself alone on planet Mars.Learning of his circumstances particularly the meager supplies available to him,he draws upon his intelligence and wit to find a way to signal on earth and ask them to send a rescue mission to save him.Faced with the impossible task and with the world informed about his predicament,the rescue mission is cheered upon by many people to conduct this impossible task of bringing Watney safely. This is a wonderfully made movie.Ridley Scott and Matt Damon did well as director and actor respectively especially the latter who probably had one of the best performances that he has ever had in his career.The story of hope and optimism will truly inspire the viewer especially in these tough and challenging times around the world.Added to the theme of the triumph of the human spirit,it was also fun to see a great mixture of science,intelligence and humor into the movie particularly in main character.Definitely a must-see feel good movie.The man on Mars Ridley Scott's The Martian was wonderfully realised on 3D for the big cinema screen. It probably will not come across well on the small screen. Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is separated from his spacecraft and crew on a mission to Mars. Instead of panicking he overcomes the obstacles in his way by thinking outside of the box to survive as long as possible. When NASA find out that Mark is still alive his former crew mates turn around for a rescue mission. The film is essentially a lone survival film without the protagonist not exactly getting too lonely or crazy. There is the parallel story of NASA and other agencies working together on the rescue mission as Mark's predicament catches the public's attention. The problem with this type of movie and it happened with Gravity is that you can be blown away with special effects the first time round but it might lack rewatch value.Smart, exciting crowd-pleaser Exceptional sci-fi drama from Ridley Scott about an astronaut (Matt Damon) stranded on Mars and the efforts made to rescue him. As others have pointed out, there's more than a little bit here that reminds you of movies like Apollo 13 and Cast Away (particularly the former). I fail to see how that's a knock on it but it's being presented as such by some. We all come to movies with our own expectations and baggage. I'm not a Scott fanboy expecting him to wow me (his last two films were not great). I just wanted to be entertained and this did the trick. It's a movie aimed at the masses that is smarter than your average movie aimed at the masses. Maybe it's not for all nerds (a quick glance at some of the reviews shows a lot of inane nit-picking from people who seem to have no concept of dramatic license), but I didn't find the movie dumbed-down at all. I also want to say how much I appreciated that this managed to stay remarkably light and positive while still maintaining the tension, proving once again that you don't have to be depressing to be good drama. If you haven't seen The Martian yet, you should. It's a great film with a first-rate cast, good direction, and stellar effects. If you're just looking for a quality movie to entertain you for a while, this should be something you'll enjoy.So touching! This film tells the remarkable story of an astronaut stranded on Mars during a space mission. He does everything he can to survive, while the Earth sets up an unprecedented rescue mission to bring him back home safely. Many people say "The Martian" is a very good film, and I do agree after watching it. The plot is simple but it has all the right elements to capture the viewers' hearts. To see Mark survive against all odds is very engaging and touching. In addition, the Herculean efforts to rescue him back to Earth is even more touching because there are almost insurmountable technical difficulties. The risk of failure is so high, that death seems almost certain. That of course brings about an poignant ending, which surely leaves me in tears. I enjoyed watching "The Martian".I wasn't overly fussy about it to be honest... (Credit IMDb) During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. The Martian was a major disappointment for me. Mars looks fantastic and everything looks great, but I wasn't able to ever fully get into it like I wanted to. It never felt like Matt Damon was in any true danger to me despite how it was presented otherwise. It tries way too hard to be epic and that's one of the reason it fails. I also felt it lacked suspense. One thing Gravity did well was deliver suspense, but The Martian doesn't. This surprised me a lot because Ridley Scott is a master at suspense. Even though I didn't really go nuts over this movie like a lot of people did, Matt Damon is fantastic. He holds the film together with his excellent performance. I can't really say the same for the rest. Everybody else isn't developed that well. Jessica Chastain is a very capable actress, but she isn't given much to do as I'd hoped. Wiig, Daniels, Bean, Mara, Ejiofor all do fine in the roles they are given. Ejiofor and Mara shine the most out of the people I listed This movie has its moments, but I was very disappointed overall. It looks great, Damon is superb, but I wasn't in love with it like so many others. Hopefully I'm not alone  6/10Typical Overrated Claptrap¬ÖFamiliar, Forced, and Forgettable Artificial, Derivative, and unwelcome Things like Forced and Unfunny one liners and...Wait for it.........A lot of Disco Muzak...while constantly Reminding the Audience just how Bad Disco Muzak is. The Film has very Little Style and the Shining, pristine Sets Look OK, but begin to Bore after a while. The Space Shots and the Mars Landscape, Ditto. The Acting is Stiff, and the PC inclusions are Distracting. All of the Action set Pieces, what Few there are, have been Seen in other Sci-Fi Films. The "Coming Together" of Earth's Population with Clich√©d "Time Square" shots from Around the World have been Done to Death in the Genre, "War of the World's" (1953) and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" (1951), to Name a couple. In Fact, almost Everything in the Story has been Done before and the Film just Can't Escape it's Familiar Territory with anything New, Exciting, or Inventive. It really is a Big Disappointment and will only Seem Fresh to Young Folks and People that Don't Watch a lot of Movies. Overall, Average at Best, but Cookie-Cutter to the Extreme, Flat, Uninventive, and some severe Missteps (Disco and Stand Up Routines), Render this just Another Big Budget, quickly Forgotten, A-Picture trying to bring its B-Movie Pedigree to New Heights. Truth be Told, the B-Movies do it Better.My Favorite Martian Movie Hollywood has made approximately 29 movies about planet Mars. The five most recent sagas about Mars‚Äî"Mission to Mars" (2000), "Red Planet" (2000), "Doom" (2005), "John Carter" (2012), and The Last Days on Mars (2013)‚Äîfailed to recoup their budgets. Among the notable films about Mars that most moviegoers may remember are the four-minute silent film "A Trip to Mars" (1910), the Soviet silent epic "Aelita" (1924), "Flight to Mars" (1951), "Conquest of Space" (1955), "The Angry Red Planet" (1956), "It! The Terror from Beyond Space" (1957), "Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1962), "Total Recall" (1990) and its' remake "Total Recall" (2012). "Mission to Mars" surpassed "Red Planet" while "John Carter" wasn't abominably bad. Halloween" helmer John Carpenter has probably made one of the least compelling pulp movies about Mars entitled "Ghosts of Mars." Happily, the latest movie about Mars appropriately entitled "The Martian" ranks as probably the best movie ever made about the fourth rock from the sun. Apart from its unwieldy 141 minutes that starts to drag about three-fourths of the way through, "The Martian" is a believable sci-fi film. Anybody who has read Andrew Weir's bestseller will be pleased with director Ridley Scott's largely faithful adaptation penned by Drew Goddard who wrote the abysmal "Cloverfield" but the brilliant "The Cabin in the Woods." Ostensibly, Scott and Goddard only saw fit to omit two major complications from Weir's fascinating first novel: the short-circuit drill scene when our hero is modifying the second Rover and the tumbling Rover scene on the journey to the Schiaparelli crater. The predominantly first-person narrated novel contains more of astronaut Mark Watney's acerbic, R-rated personality than the PG-13 film could afford. For example, read the first sentence in "The Martian." If either it or subsequent sentences with the F-word don't offend you, you can probably make it through this entertaining book rather rapidly. When a devastating Martian sandstorm threatens NASA's Ares III manned mission, Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain of "Interstellar") orders the six-person crew to abandon their work and lift off for their ship, the Hermes, in orbit around the red planet. During their hasty evacuation, one of the astronauts, botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon of "Interstellar"), is separated from the crew. Actually, he is struck by an antenna on a communication dish that skewers him in the stomach and knocks him unconscious. Lewis struggles without success to find Watney in the blinding sandstorm. Meanwhile, the sandstorm grows even more treacherous, and Lewis gives up her search because the high winds are tilting the ship that will launch the crew into orbit. Basically, the crew of the Ares III leaves Mark behind to save itself. NASA Chief Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels of "My Favorite Martian") reports the news of Watney's demise, and a funeral is held for him. What nobody knows at the time is that Watney is still alive. After he extracts the spear of the antenna from his stomach, Watney embarks on an ambitious scheme to keep himself alive for the next four years until Ares IV arrives. A major part of Watney's plan to keep from starving involves the planting of potatoes inside the mission's artificial habitat. Eventually, one of NASA's employees, Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis of "That Awkward Moment"), who monitors the satellites around Mars, spots something suspicious in the photos of the Ares III mission site. She alerts Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor of "American Gangster") about these curious occurrences. Everybody is suddenly elated when they discover that Watney managed to survive the savage sandstorm. Sanders brainstorms and convenes various NASA experts to work on a rescue plan for Watney, but NASA has no way of contacting our tenacious hero. At the same time, Watney behaves like the ingenious television character MacGuyer. He improvises a way to communicate with NASA that involves cruising in the Mars rover off to the distant site of the Mars Pathfinder probe. Meanwhile, Sanders refuses to notify the Hermes crew because he fears the revelation of Watney's survival may imperil the mission. Initially, NASA crew supervisor Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean of "GoldenEye") and JPL director Bruce Ng (Benedict Wong of "Prometheus") launch a space probe to resupply Watney until the Ares IV mission gets off the ground. The probe blows up not long after launch. If this were not bad enough for Watney, the habitat where he is raising his potato plants explodes when the airlock decompresses. Naturally, nothing goes right for either Watney or NASA, but salvation comes from the least expected place. "Blade Runner" director Ridley Scott keeps things compelling throughout most of "The Martian" as Watney and NASA encounter one invincible setback after another. Indeed, "The Martian" surpasses the similarly-themed Sandra Bullock &amp; George Clooney outer space epic "Gravity" because the story is related from a number of different perspectives. While Watney is struggling to survive on Mars, Sanders is under incredible pressure to concoct a foolproof plan to rescue him. Every plan that he comes up with requires his team to work so quickly that they cannot take their usual precautions. "The Martian" shifts back and forth between Watney and the various NASA officials working around the clock to save him. Eventually, Sanders allows Henderson to inform the Hermes crew about Watney's survival. Production values are generally stellar and nothing appears to have been spared. The craggy scenery of Jordan substitutes persuasively for the inhospitable Martian terrain. The part of the action transpires within the massive Hermes spaceship, and the five person crew weigh in on Watney's fate. Happily, "The Martian" isn't a dry, straightforward, documentary style sci-fi thriller. Although he doesn't appear on screen every minute, Matt Damon dominates "The Martian" and Watney's irreverent sense of humor. The inspirational finale when Watney decides to imitate Iron Man is amusing. Not only did NASA embrace author Andrew Weir, but the space agency also reportedly cooperated with Ridley Scott more than it had on previous movies to ensure accuracy. Altogether, "The Martian" qualifies as a gripping intergalactic spectacle.One of the year's best (and smartest) movies. THE MARTIAN (2015) **** Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover. Epic, fun and enthralling science fiction drama with Damon as a botanist left behind on Mars accidentally being believed to be killed on an expedition, resulting in his savvy brain trust (his and NASA's) to get him home in spite of tremendous odds, obstacles and pitfalls. Ridley Scott pulls out all the stops with brio and smartly sprinkles in dollops of self-ware, world-weary humor (thanks to a fine adaptation of Andy Weir's book by Drew Goddard) and a sterling cast including bright-eyed Chastain as his commander hell-bent on the rescue mission, Ejiofor and Daniels as squabbling team pundits and again, Damon in a career high turn as the self-possessed yet vulnerable Mark Watney in a performance ranking up there with Tom Hanks' in CASTAWAY &amp; Sandra Bullock's in GRAVITY ; in other words - Oscar-worthy. A must see in 3-D with some truly amazing visuals and a superb sound track of '70s disco tunes. One of the year's best (and smartest) movies.If I wrote this book, I'd be very upset with how it was handled. The author Andy Weir must be very upset with how his incredible book was watered down from a survival story to a vacation on Mars. Since he had no creative control, we can only blame Drew Goddard (screenplay) and Ridley Scott (director). The book is filled with science, math, intelligence, problem solving, tension, obstacles, survival and wise-ass remarks. Sadly, they decided to keep in the wise-ass comments and cut the rest. The movie feels like the main character is on a 2 year vacation on Mars, rather than fighting for his life and struggling to survive, like in the book. Day after day, he just waits to be rescued, without having to overcome much. This is my main problem with this film. They removed mostly all of the obstacles that Mark had to overcome to survive, and just glossed over what he did overcome. These obstacles demonstrate the intelligence and resolve of the character, all which is lost in the film. Removing the obstacles also removes the tension, which the book had plenty of. Here are some major obstacles that were in the book and not in the movie:  -Mark accidentally destroys the Pathfinder communications while drilling holes in the Rover roof. This prevents him from communicating with NASA for his entire journey to the Aries IV site. He's completely in the dark. On his own, trying to prepare for the LONG trip. Keeping this in would have added suspension that the filmed lacked. -While en route to the Aries IV site, Mark encounters a dust storm that delays his journey. The dust storm prevents the sun from recharging his Rover batteries via the solar panels. Mark has to figure out a way around the storm without dying, and also has time against him. He must avoid the storm and still make it to the Aries site before the MAV launches. This again would have added tension, conflict, and suspense. All missing from the film. In the film he just gets in his rover, and a few days later, arrives 3200km away, exactly where he needs to. It's lazy. -Mark finally overcomes the storm, figures out a solution, and cheats death. Back on track, just as he's nearing the Aries IV site, he goes off a ridge and flips his rovers and almost dies again. He has to problem solve to get to the MAV site on time before the launch. This would have added more tension, more suspense...all which is lost in the film version. -The book has Mark deploying a pop-up tent from the Rover Airlock to sleep in on his journey. The movie skips all of this, and instead show him sleeping under the rover...in the freezing mars atmosphere. It was interesting to me in the book how he crafted a custom tent for his bedroom for the journey. -The book goes into detail on survival on a foreign planet, with numbers to back it up. It explains everything in the HAB, and what it's for. The film merely mentions a few key things, but never explains what they are for. Like how does he have enough oxygen to survive? How is he removing the CO2 from the air so that it doesn't reach toxic levels? This would have been great to show Mark figuring these out on screen in real time. Show how smart he is...that maybe he can get out of this if he puts his mind to it. All skipped. I can't believe they don't mention oxygen supply once. They assume if he's in a suit, he can breath. "I'm going to have to science the s*** out of this." ... So much so that you won't even know he used any science at all.. What's so great in the book is how Mark is able to MacGyver everything, and overcome all of the obstacles that come in his way in order to survive. When you remove all of those obstacles, it just feels like Mark is waiting on another planet for his friends to pick him up. It loses all tension, all suspense...they took way too many shortcuts. You may argue that time was an issue, and that is why those scenes were cut. Nah...I don't need the final celebration scenes in the movie, the post credit roll that highlights the actors, the final scene where Mark is an instructor. Cut all that out and put in the good stuff. The stuff that life is about...obstacles and overcoming them. Bottom line, it's lazy, and doesn't do the book justice. If you want the real movie experience where you actually care about the characters and what's transpiring, listen to book.It's a good movie, but it's a great book. (Very minor comparisons to the book- no direct reference to scenes) I recently read 'The Martian'. It's a book I had wanted to pick up for a long time and when I saw the film was soon to arrive, in the usually capable hands of Ridley Scott and Matt Damon, it seemed like the perfect time to pick it up. I'll start by saying the book is incredible, and quite possibly the best book I've read in years. Once you pick it up it's impossible to put back down and I was finished in a couple of days. The detail that Andy Weir goes into in describing the surroundings and Mark Watney's predicament are so detailed it makes for a compelling read. What makes the book strong eventually becomes the film's downfall. There is just too much in the book to include in a film. As a result a lot of detail is chopped to keep the film from becoming too complicated...and it's already running at 2hours 20minutes. Changes have been made to the original story, for what can only be deemed 'Hollywood reasons' although whilst creating a slight frown on the face of anyone who has read the book, doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film. I am sure there is a Ridley cut of this film out there which will run to over 3 hours and no doubt cover off some of my gripes. All in all, if you want to see this film, read the book first.Do I need to watch this movie or the Description is enough ?? (Warning: possible spoilers below) ...somewhere on Mars, the following drama unfolds: After many tries to send the signal (that ingenuity, wit etc, from the description) our hero is about to give up; his equipment is failing and the signal just can't reach the Earth. Then, with the last electrons firing up his synapse and while his eyes are closing forever, he had a providence: Fire up that last electromagnetic wave, left in the transceiver, right to mountain, bounce it off the moon, and right to the place on Earth where the receiving satellite/radar/whatever resides. IF AND ONLY IF his calculation is right, the signal will be able to reach reach the radar. But, there is a slight problem and fortunately, our hero knows about it - even when the signal reaches the radar, it'll be too weak and under the radar detection threshold. But he knows what to do - shoot the signal to the outer space, right where the electromagnetic storm (from the sun) is building up. There, this tiny electromagnetic wave will amplify, will bounce off the Venus, will hit the moon and finally reach the earth, as we said previously... He has only one chance to do this, as the storm is rapidly moving out of solar system. As you can see, both the timing and calculations have to be perfect, making this a nail-biting drama... ...somewhere on Earth, the following drama unfolds: After many desperate hours, our main character, she, the scientists, is slowly accepting the reality of the situation; she stays last at work, taking on her the task to switch of the satellite. She feels it's her responsibility all that happened. But she just can't leave yet ‚Äì somewhere deep, she starts realizing she is love with our brave hero. She stares to the screen for hours, slowly realizing it's about time to give up and leave him to the stars¬Ö She exhales, stands up, and walks toward the main switch¬Ö But just when she was about to flip that switch, she sees a reflection on the switch metal plate: THE RED LIGHT ON THE SATELLITE LIT UP !!! (The music builds up here¬Ö) What happened next I don't even have to tell you; a frantic rescue mission begins. Another drama unfolds; will they reach him before he spends all the oxygen?? Story short: they've found him, breathing the very last oxygen molecule he had left...  All the drama ends with a huge applause back at the research base. But the movie doesn't end yet; just about a minute left for her to kiss him, before the movie lights go out¬ÖRiddley Scott's decadence The decadence of Ridley Scott in my opinion. The one who offered us some great movies ("Allien" is enough I believe to make the comparison and point out the importance of a good scenario and small budget to create a "great" movie). The whole movie hasn't created, to me at least, the feeling of agony and suspense that was meant to create and I cannot understand the dithyrambic critics (8.2 IMDb score?). More it was a movie like "Indepedence Day", where the "good guys" win nomatter what..... A great disappointment from Ridley Scott and a movie that did not offer anything new, from a director that has created collosal movies in the past (what to count first: Blade Runner, Allien, Gladiator..... 0.surprisingly well directed movie Every so often you see a star of a movie. This movie is that bright start. Cast, the direction etc couldn't be any better.This year Hasn't been a banner year for good movie, but this one indeed measures up.I can sit here and type out spoilers etc, but i not going to break the excitement for those that haven't seen it. "2001 SPACE ODYSSEY" being this kind of movie that all measured from, does just that. I am viewer, i love watching movie when i see this kind and well made, I am happy viewer. Thats what manners.If you have a chance to see it DO SO! don't take words from me or anyone else here..Seeing is believing.If your in to space movies this one is a can't miss. ...edit........3 people hated my review? come on these comments are mostly from people that Didn't EVEN PAY SEE THE MOVIE.....If you believe you know best think again! Updated.......if people continue to post negative votes.....it proves people don't read what's written.....(pay see the movie, then have right..otherwise cool it.I Loved The Movie But......... Why? Why? Why would you make such a great movie and put an actor like Kristen Wiig in it? She was a low point of the movie. She CANNOT ACT at the level of the other actors. Thank goodness she had a small part. Luckily the movie is so good it barely distracted the audience. Other then that I found the movie to be great. It held my interests and kept me on the edge of my seat. The special effects were tremendous. I thought I was on Mars with the actors. I found the scenery to be realistic and not on a set. It set the mood for someone being alone and so far from home. When the scene started with a far away shot as if it was from a probe orbiting Mars, you felt marooned. If you want to see a wonderful Science-Fiction movie this is one you should not miss.An Amazing Tension-Filled Space Journey with Beautiful Cinematography "WOW" is the one word I would describe this movie. Just wow. Today I sat down in my small theater expecting a good space movie with some tension filled scenes. And I got that, but it wasn't "good" it was Amazing. I have to start this review by saying if you haven't watch this movie in a theater yet, Do it! The cinematography is unbelievable and has to be experienced on the big screen. I noticed myself wondering if they actually filmed on Mars. So all credit goes to: Dariusz Wolski Both the writing and directing in this movie was on point. I'm very glad for Ridley Scott, this is easily one of his best movies. And the acting was great, With a surprisingly great performance from Jeff Daniels as Teddy Sanders aka "Bad guy but not really" To be honest, I'm pretty bad when it comes to rating a movie, but as of right now I would give this movie 9.5 pies out of 10 ---My first review so keep that in mind----A very fun, entertaining, and optimistic film, highly recommended I spent the whole day waiting to go to the theater to see this. Due to some inconveniences I missed lunch (there is a point to this just wait) so by the time I left I was starving and in a rush to get there in time for the film. I got there bought my ticket and relaxed. I sat there as my stomach growled and waited till the movie started, from start to finish I didn't once think of being hungry or when this movie was going to get over so I could eat. This film immersed me so fast I didn't have time to crave any food besides my hunger helped me relate with the main character. This movie is surprisingly hilarious, when I think of an astronaut being isolated millions of miles from earth I would have never expected an approach showing so much humor and optimism. The good thing about the humor is is that it isn't corny or stupid it's almost always clever. The optimism is a great aspect that at a time were in now gives us a breath of fresh air, a lot of films now a days and TV shows for this matter usually get really dark and turn away viewers this film is good for almost all audiences due to the positivity. Even in moments where odds get very narrow the optimism Matt Damon's character has shines through that narrow opening almost always in the film. The only group I see hating this are those who don't like Matt Damon in the presence of a movie. If you don't like him your not gonna like this movie because 85% of this movie is all him. I for one really like Matt Damon and the character he plays on screen. Things that go without saying such as that the technical aspects and acting are all great. Overall I can't think of a bad thing to say about this film. What I do have to say is that you should see this movie (unless your anti Damon) because the film shows how even in a distressing situation such as this everyone can come together regardless to bring this man home and if you ask me this is something we need not just in this country right now but in the world. I urge you to see this film as you will most likely enjoy it and catch the inspiration that lies within as well. Thanks for reading my review and I hope you enjoy the film.A Classic and a Masterpiece Just seen it! Brilliant! Great story, great acting, great directing, great cinematography and much more - a feast for the human eye.  Matt Damon's acting is excellent throughout, at times delivered with his own charming sense of humour and he is the linchpin that holds the film together complimented by the rest of the cast. It's far from being completely focused on Matt Damon; the story is well balanced between all the varied scenes and to me Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Kate Mara and Chiwetel Ejiofor really stand out. Great casting and, of course, great directing by Ridley Scott.  The scenery, CGI, 'hardware' and props give the movie gravitas and an unquestioned sense of feeling real absorbing you into the story and adding a sense of gravitas. The overall production is a credit to everybody involved and an an unreserved success.  Not perfect but a masterpiece of entertainment, storytelling and celebration of the human spirit. Beautiful and at times very touching. I command you to go and see this movie! A Classic and a Masterpiece.Preachy, sanctimonious bull crap People go to the cinema to be entertained, not to be schooled by people who have no idea what are they talking about. And on top of everything: why do you have to add politics and forced multiculturalism to every movie?! Is there a committee in Hollywood who demands that every single movie has to include multiculturalism, forced, not funny jokes, American flag, American nationalism, women who are good leaders?! It's like all the movies were written by the same people, all the effects done by the same crew, time to change Hollywood! Ridley Scott how could you? This movie is not entertaining, it's full of politics and preachy bull crap.Pitiful, mindless movie where everyone wins..... Awful, awful, awful! A supremely predictable movie with horrible acting from otherwise good actors. A movie made for mindless people who love spending $50 and upwards to see a catastrophe where everyone wins all the time, and in-between laced with little 'scare' moments where they get the audience all worked up that Disneyland is falling apart. Pathetic! If you're a mindless sloth who enjoys movies where everyone wins against all odds ( you know that will be the case with this movie even before it starts) and you don't like to think at all, then this movie is for you. It is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long, long time.....It SUCKED! It says a lot about America and Americans when a movie this bad, rakes in more than 220 million and gets such great and glorifying reviews.Blah Personally didn't like the movie very much. In my opinion there was way to much Humor for a Sci-fi drama. I felt like the main character ( Matt Damon) didn't capture someone actually stranded in a life or death situation. Compared to Interstellar this movie was a flop. Had no emotional attachment to any of the main characters. This movie was extremely " Hollywoodized " with an unreasonable amount of impossible "WTF" moments. I knew from the 1st couple minutes the entire script and how some characters would act ( predictable ). Id rather see a more realistic version without the humor. I'm no movie critic just a un- educated bottom feeder.Most boring movie of the year, by far. 2 hours and 21 minutes of Matt Damon gardening, and people at NASA discussing how to rescue him. Seriously. That's the whole movie. Total boredom. Just so you know, I like all kinds of movies. I'm not impatient. I have a degree in a tech field. But geez, this movie is soooo boring. And it's stupid!! And the casting is terrible. A 22-year-old hot model-type woman is the only one at NASA smart enough to locate Damon. And a 22-year-old slob who looks like he's strung-out on drugs (rolling out of a bed in his FILTHY MESSY office, twitching, shaking, stuttering) is the only one at NASA smart enough to think of using a slingshot-effect for the rocket. But they're SOOOO smart that they can attend high-level, and I'm talking the highest level on a national scale....they can attend these meetings in street clothes, while everyone else is in suits and ties. I know Damon is extremely politically-correct, and so are most Hollywood movies these days. But this one goes too far. Literally every scene alternates between a person of a different race. White, African-American, African, Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern. And every scene has a man and a woman in it. Michael Pena as an astronaut?? Hello....do I really need to explain that you have to be in-shape to be an astronaut??Too damn predictable nonsense! Well, firstly, Ridley ticked all the boxes in what the audience expects to see, even if it is a sci-fi genre movie. Then, where is the devastation of the devastating news that matt damon received? Then all the corny jokes? and the unnecessary swearing meant to resemble the directors' POV. The racial discrimination that is made obvious in the films effort not to make it obvious. The predictable yeah scenes. Im so surprised there was no alien busting out of Matt Damon's chest! Ridley you are ridiculous and you made me under appreciate Matt Damon's acting. This truly was a pathetic movie. Just ask any black man with a Kapoor Family name! What a waste of time, but Im not surprised it was a hit, as the target audience you sought appreciated it. "clap clap clap".
Visual poetry - and a celebration of human resilience as well as an ode to the savage beauty of nature A lot has been said and written about this film, mostly about its troubled production - forget all that: it has no meaning whatsoever for the experience this film provides. A word of advice though: if you go in expecting a testosterone-fueled revenge thriller in the vein of 'Apocalypto', you'll likely end up disappointed. It's simply not that kind of film - but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it if you watch it with the right expectations. 'The Revenant' opens with images from a dream; we see snippets of memories showing a peaceful life - and soon the loss of that peace, and the loss of life. The images change and we hear the soothing sound of gurgling water as we follow the camera via a long tracking shot over a flooded forest; it's an image that seems to imply peace, evoking nature's beauty with an almost meditative quality - before the barrel of a rifle appears in the frame. Those first three minutes I just described (which are the only spoilers you will get in this review) set the tone for the film perfectly. It's a film that tells a story of harrowing circumstances through images that are breathtakingly beautiful; a film about survival and death and shocking acts of sudden violence - and yet a film that, despite all its visceral intensity, also has a quiet, immersive quality to it that feels almost hypnotic. Many critics and reviewers have pointed out the stark contrast between the film's poetic beauty and the ugliness of its violence - implying the director wanted to use this contrast to make a certain point regarding mankind's interference with nature. While that would seem pretty obvious (and it probably is at least partly true), I left the film feeling I√±arritu had shown a vaster, far too complete image of the clash between man and nature to justify such a simplistic interpretation of the events portrayed on screen. Whether intentionally or not, I√±arritu shows the star of his film with a complexity and honesty that we normally don't get to see in these kinds of stories. And I'm not talking about Leonardo DiCaprio here (who gives a no-holds-barred, crazy good performance and I'd love to see him win an Oscar for this film) - the star of this film is not a person: it IS nature, plain and simple. The revenge plot - which felt almost like an afterthought or a ploy to give the film a certain structure and a proper ending - is not really the film's main theme or strongest aspect, and it certainly isn't the reason that made this film so compelling to watch for me. Such stories have been told often enough - and often better - than in 'The Revenant'. No, what really made this film stand out for me is that I have NEVER seen a Hollywood film (any film, really - apart from documentaries) that showed nature in such an unflinchingly honest and mesmerizing way as was the case here. And the way I perceive it, I√±arritu sees his human protagonists as being very much a part of nature as a whole - regardless of their destructive behaviour.  It's that refreshingly wholistic approach (which some viewers might perceive as nihilism on the director's part) that I found to be the film's biggest accomplishment: it depicts the people in this story as just another species trying to survive in that perilous frontier-world. The emphasis is not really on the moral aspects of the brutal injustice that the main character suffers or how the Native Americans are cruelly exploited; we witness all that - but I√±arritu keeps a certain emotional distance, as if he were shooting a documentary about predatory wildlife. And just like the bear's attack, most of the violence in this film comes as a reaction of defense. Be it self-defense, defending one's offspring or defending territory and valuable resources. Even the character that comes closest to an actual villain is driven by fear - not hate, and his most obvious character defects were caused by a very traumatizing experience. As in nature, there is a simple (if often brutal) logic to why most characters, men or beasts, act the way they do in 'The Revenant' (OK, maybe not the French - but I didn't say the film was perfect, did I). And the bear attack was the most realistic depiction of an animal attack I have ever seen on film. All in all, this film felt less like a story of revenge and more like an ode to the visceral beauty of nature and the relentless, savage force that is life; it provides an immensely absorbing - and touching - experience to those who have an affinity for the wilderness, but it's also a visual masterpiece and a great piece of old-school filmmaking for lovers of Cinema. It's not perfect (especially during the last third of the film where I felt the pacing was a bit off), but it's a film the likes of which we will only rarely get to see - if at all - in the future. 'The Revenant' is visual poetry of the most primal kind, and it should be seen on the biggest screen possible. 9 stars out of 10 from me. Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/ Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/ Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Great photography, not so great film You are almost immediately plunged into the action, in a similar way to the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan', with a Native American attack on a group of fur trappers. DiCaprio even does that momentarily deaf thing that Tom Hanks does. Lots of bows and arrows and gore and excellent photography that is really immersive. Great opening scene. There there's the scene where DiCaprio is mauled by a grizzly bear. Again, really believable, exciting and up front and personal - you can almost smell the bear's stinking breath. Brilliant.  And then there's ... well ... not much really. Photography and scenery are by and large excellent but you do get the feeling that better use could have been made of them. I√±√°rritu often seems to chop scenes around for no particular reason, although you do get the occasional sense of the vast wilderness that comes over well on the big screen. Dialogue is scarce. Most of it goes to Tom Hardy who tries to put on a Texan accent but succeeds in sounding as if he has a sock in his mouth (does he specialise in being inaudible? remember him as the mumbling Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises'?).  Then there's the storyline. You know the ending, right? (Just look up the definition of 'revenant'.) Leo is up against it and he suffers a great deal. But you know he is going to survive. So when, to top everything, he falls off a cliff on his horse you realise he's actually become Mr Indestructible. And two and a half hours of crawling, grimacing and wincing does not a very entertaining film make. There are also several non-credible plot twists. Like when Tom Hardy (a.k.a. The Mumbler) somehow cracks an impressive-looking safe and makes off with the garrison money and just two guys go after him, including the garrison commander. This nicely sets up the final confrontation between Mr Indestructible and The Mumbler .... but really?  We also develop little or no emotional connection with the main character. The silent dream scenes are a clich√©d way of trying to do this and they don't work in my opinion - they're just puzzling and boring. Nor do we see much of the relationship between Leo and his son to set up the emotional links between them - just Leo being harsh and dishing out tough love a couple of times.  The pacing is also poor. Once you've passed the opening scene and the grizzly scene, feel free to go and refresh your popcorn - you won't miss much.  Overall, the film is self-consciously bleak and overdetermined and is unevenly paced. A better director might possibly have made this a good film but I√±√°rritu is clearly not David Lean. If DiCaprio gets an Oscar for this it will be because the Academy think they owe him one and possibly because of the hype. This is a film that will be forgotten. If you want to see a good silent movie with snow, ice, struggle for survival and even the odd grizzly bear thrown in, watch Chaplin's 'The Gold Rush' - it's far more entertaining.One of the Best Movies I'll never watch twice The Revenant falls into the same category as Aronofsky's "Requiem for a Dream" and Spielberg's "Schindler's List" for me, in the essence of being a terrific movie but not something I think I can sit through a second time. In all these movies there are brutal sequences that cause emotional stress and disgust just watching because it is so REAL and GRIPPING. To think that events in these movies actually happened or that they could very well happen is too much for me to think about. Not to say that I did not enjoy this film thoroughly.  The Revenant is a technical masterpiece that left me wondering "How the hell did they do that?" after many scenes and sequences. With beautiful cinematography and adroit camera movement this film is a visual magnum opus. It is apparent that the great minds that put forth this film are none other than the same ones that brought us Birdman: Lubezki and Inarritu. There are many long shots without cuts that are sprinkled throughout the film that add a sense of sophistication to it with the added bonus of predominantly location based shooting and natural lighting for the film , that can even make a novice film watcher raise an eyebrow at its complexity.  The camera work is not the only noteworthy aspect of the film; The actors did a superb job executing their rolls. Many are raving about DiCaprio's performance but I was more of a fan of Hardy's brutal and gritty character Fitzgerald. Granted, half the words that came out of his mouth were unintelligible but he left no doubt in my mind that he was fully devoted to his role and bringing Fitzgerald alive instead of just Hardy playing a character named Fitzgerald. He was simply amazing. With all this said, there are still flaws in the film. At some points it was dragging on and moving too slow. It gave the impression that the film itself was cocky and wanted to show off all of its beautiful scenery and camera work too much. Then there was the "he shouldn't be alive" situations. Hugh Glass was a real guy that really did survive a bear mauling but in the film they make this guy practically immortal. There were too many instances where I was thinking "he should be dead three times over right now, for me to enjoy the film as much I should have.  All in all a great film that I only recommend to seasoned and mature film viewers.Visually beautiful, story-wise not on par... The natural landscape and some of the scenes are overwhelming and spectacular! The camera-work is so immersive, you believe are a part of Hugh Glass' journey through the wilderness and back to civilization. Also with great performances not only by DiCaprio, but also Hardy, as the unsympathetic fellow fur trapper leaving Glass behind.  Story-wise, it is a bit thin for a 156 min picture. Glass' quest for vengeance is sometimes lost as he utters few words about his drive and is being more or less, chased himself. The story arc of the Indians quest for their daughter felt a bit out of place and strange. We also get to see the fur trappers p.o.v. that left Glass behind and the Captain way ahead of them. Which in my opinion takes a little bit of the magic of Glass' total perilous journey. All my stars goes to the beauty, production value and performances alone! Regardless, this is one of those overlong movies one like, but would not sit out for another viewing!A Powerfully Bleak &amp; Masterful Film Take the direction of Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu, combine it with the stunning cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki and toss in Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy for their acting charms and what do you get? An extraordinary and masterful film. Fresh off of 'Birdman,' I√±√°rritu moved straight on to 'The Revenant,' a western-epic inspired by the true-life experiences of frontiersman Hugh Glass in the winter-struck landscape of 1820s America. The film gained some notoriety in mid-2015 for its production problems and has thus been regarded one of the most challenging film shoots in the history of cinema. Rightfully so. The film opens with the soothing sound of running water, thrusting the audience into an almost meditative state, and then it strikes, an action-packed sequence ensues with a near single sweeping take. Now this is a spoiler-free review, so I'll leave the pleasure of viewing that scene to you. This film heavily evokes reactions from the audience and does so well, whether it's staring at the screen in awe or gasping at the visceral violence, if you face this film with the right attitude and expectations, it will be a thrill ride like no other. Lubezki has proved that he is one of the most fantastic cinematographers of modern cinema, and the extensive use of natural lighting over artificial supports that statement even further, the film is beyond stunning. Supporting this is the score from the relatively unknown composers, believe me, when the sudden orchestral boom strikes your eardrums, it's mesmerising. The makeup, the direction, the editing, the visual aesthetics, and of course the performances from a hopefully soon-to-be Oscar winning DiCaprio, 'The Revenant' is a visual treat for those who appreciate cinema and for those who wish to just get absorbed by the immense landscapes and poetic justice I√±√°rritu has given it. This is, for me, a modern masterpiece.A classic case of style over substance What an absolute waste of 2.5 hours. It didn't look like it was going to be my type of film, but the trailer was very convincing, not to mention the plethora of award nominations it has received, so I decided to give it a go. Mistake. It started with a collection of superb actors, delivering solid performances. Despite what I've read, I thought Tom Hardy's accent was spot on - that is what that accent sounds like! Domhnall Gleeson is in everything these days, for good reason, and Will Poulter was certainly endearing. Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent, dragging oneself through the snow post-bear mauling should be pretty torturous, and as we know from Wolf of Wall Street's infamous 'Ludes' scene, DiCaprio is a pro at crawling and grunting. A cast such as this should have delivered an outstanding movie, so I can only assume something went catastrophically wrong with the script. Because my God was it BORING. There was absolutely zero character development. If you're going to produce something that is on the long side, at least give me something to work with here? The son was killed so early (and following so few lines) I genuinely didn't care, which didn't help to lay a foundation for why I should care about Glass's prolonged revenge mission.  As well as the characters being entirely 2D, they also quickly became parodies of themselves. "The Revenant Presents: Domhnall Gleeson as the Principled Yet Naive Captain (who must die as punishment for his ineptitude); Tom Hardy as the Southern Villain (with no redeeming features, who likewise must die to maintain the idea of a Just World); Will Poulter as the Impressionable Young Soldier-type and Leonardo DiCaprio as the Tortured Hero. Don't forget the Arrogant French Braggarts, and the Wise Yet Ruthless Indigenous People. Oh and Tom Hardy's Random Cockney Friend." While I still think Hardy's accent was well executed, the choice to use an accent which is often a source of ridicule (I'm not endorsing that view) only served to undermine the tension rather than build it, making him seem like a fool rather than a dangerous adversary. Admittedly, he did a kill a number of people so maybe playing The Fool was his way of lulling everyone into a false sense of security. DiCaprio was convincing in his role of the Aggrieved Father avenging the death of his son, but his journey of adversity quickly became absurd rather than laudable. The bear attack was BRUTAL, and as his company quickly concluded, it seems unlikely he would have survived his injuries, particularly when being carted around in the depth of winter.  But no, not only does he survive, he also survives Hardy's attempt to smother him, and being dragged into a partial burial, as well as witnessing the murder of his son (which would be enough to render any of us catatonic). OK, this might be plausible, maybe. Then he wanders around for a bit, spurred on by the prospect of vengeance, before being nearly drowned in a river. Again, the trip down the rapids would have been enough to drown the average man, let alone someone who has just suffered a savage bear attack followed by an attempted smothering. But no, he comes to a gentle stop at the river bank and has a nap - mysteriously without succumbing to hypothermia. Cue more wandering, some assistance from a kindly fellow wanderer, and yet more wandering. As if three potential deaths weren't enough (four if you account for the bear effectively attacking him twice), he's then under attack by the very people who's daughter he's just rescued, and not only does he not get shot (despite these people having been shown to be frighteningly accurate), his horse RIDES HIM OFF A CLIFF and surprise, surprise - HE LIVES! In fact, he doesn't just survive it, he guts the dead horse and SLEEPS INSIDE IT. *Beats chest asserting manliness* By the end I was desperate for one of them to just kill the other so I could go home. Tom Hardy finally met his maker - not before uttering the obligatory moral message that revenge doesn't make us feel better. The Revenant is a classic case of style over substance. Fantastic actors, slipping effortlessly into a range of clich√©d characters, stunning cinematography, and zero emotion. I'm a crier, I will cry at the majority of films and TV shows (and occasionally books), so the fact that I not only didn't cry, but felt absolutely nothing towards any of the characters, says it all. It's clearly a polarising piece of work, I've seen many other reviews here that echo my sentiments, yet my boyfriend loved it, and the average rating is currently 8.3! Unfortunately, Award Land appears to be siding with my other half. This year's Oscar Best Picture category is a crowded race with several worthy contenders - but the Revenant is not one, and I really hope it doesn't win. Does DiCaprio deserve the nomination? He was one of the better things in this film, and playing such a role must have pushed him to his physical limits, so maybe he does. Frankly, he's massively overdue one so for God's sake just give the man an Oscar and let's forget this absurd study in masculine pride ever existed.Harrowing storytelling with a gorgeous cinematic backdrop, The Revenant is not for the faint of heart but will stick with those who make the journey. Since the first trailers of this movie came out I knew it would be an experience. Following the incredible Birdman, director Alejandro G. I√±√°rritu had the public anxiously awaiting his interpretation of this bleak survival story, and much like Birdman, I√±√°rritu is also the star of this film. The Revenant has some of the most beautiful cinematography I've ever seen. It's cold, visceral, and almost entirely authentic from the use of natural lighting to the barebones yet powerful storytelling. You can tell I√±√°rritu poured his heart into this project and it pays off tremendously. This is not to discount the incredible performances of DiCaprio and Hardy (DiCaprio finally getting his well-overdue Oscar), but it's hard to imagine the movie being so impactful had another director been at the helm.  The story is as simple as it gets. In the 1800s, a group of settlers escape an ambush by an indigenous tribe, and during their travels one man gets separated from the group and gets brutally attacked by a wild bear and subsequently left for dead by his team. It's a revenge story more than anything. What it also highlights is human perseverance and the will to live. The things that happen to this man are truly horrific and difficult to watch. I'm not sure what parts of the story were embellished or Hollywoodized, but this film sucks you into this world and puts you right alongside this fatally wounded man desperate to survive. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a heart-wrenching performance as Hugh Glass, expressing a wide range of emotions despite the limited dialogue. Tom Hardy is also phenomenal as one of the most vile, wretched human beings on the planet. This guy is despicable to the core, and you forget you're watching Tom Hardy at times because he's completely absorbed in the role. The supporting cast is great as well despite their small time on screen. As far as performances and cinematography goes, The Revenant is flawless. What prevents this from getting a perfect 10 is one particular storyline that I didn't think was needed, and it involves the wife of Hugh Glass. She's never developed as a character but she appears intermittently in visions and dreams and it almost sucks you out of the movie for a second because of how intense the main narrative is. But this is a very small gripe. From beginning to end this movie had me on the edge of my seat, my jaw on the floor and my eyes glued to the screen. The Revenant is definitely not for everyone, but it's impossible not to appreciate it for the breathtaking cinematic achievement that it is.The Emperor is well and truly naked Utter, utter, utter, utter, waste of 2.5 hours of my life. One of the most boring films I've seen. Unintelligible dialogue and no real story. Leonardo Di Caprio is a fine actor and should have been given an Oscar for Wolf of Wall Street instead of this tripe, where he hardly has to act. OK, the conditions were harsh, but not as harsh as having to sit in a cinema and watch this. Tom Hardy was mumbling, as ever, and seemed to be a baddie for the sake of it. After an hour I was looking round the cinema to see if anyone else was as bored as I was. Di Caprio's character, Glass, is mauled, constantly frozen and wet, starved, dehydrated, witnesses (in his delirium) his son being murdered and rides off a cliff and yet I didn't really sense the suffering. Bilge.Stunningly awful I was hoping for something a bit more interesting than Hollywood's standard approach to cowboys and indians, especially as the film seems to have been critically acclaimed and Leo is a great actor.  The quality of the camera-work is excellent and the bear mauling scene very accomplished if that is the right way to describe such a visceral few minutes. But oh the plot. If you try to take it seriously it fails utterly. As an Indiana Jones caper it lacks wit. Too often you say 'I know he'd be dead from hypothermia/blood loss etc etc in any possible world but I'll just keep watching in case something interesting happens'. You ride your horse over a 150 foot drop, fall into a tree, and survive. You travel downstream in an icy river in your fur coat and don't drown/freeze. You manage to light a fire even when you are 9/10ths dead, there are no branches and you're flint went a few scenes ago. What a relief when the baddie is finally left to his fate, but then you realise you've just wasted 2 hours of your life.Why is The Revenant a darned lousy movie? Let me count the ways (As e-mailed to my few relatives, to impart the fair warning not to see this silly and execrable film.) Just saw Revenant movie with open caption last night. I bought a ticket to Kung Fu Panda 3 that plays at the same time as the movie. I may see it in hypocrisy to protest the idiot ["pendejo"] director's soap box politics. But at least I refused to pay FOR the movie directly, so they don't get my money, so there's that. As for my opinion: Terribly overrated. It's ridiculous, pretentious, inanely contrived (esp. protagonist's dead Indian wife), frequently dull and thematically &amp; aesthetically anemic with one-dimensional characters especially the villains who hammed it up. There is absolutely no point in this movie.  It is offensively politically didactic to the audience on race relations between Amerindians and whites, as if patronizing the audience by the director's self- important mockery, which felt overbearing with his overkill directorial style, like "Look at this, look at me, isn't this pretty, great job (cinematographer buddy) Chivo!" Some shots are irritating with "in your face" close-ups. There is absolutely no tension throughout the movie because of over-directing that is so palpably annoying it kills the enjoyment with occasional dull pacing in paper-thin plot structure.  There are unintentionally laughable scenes that require suspension of disbelief like CGI animals (not just the mauling bear) and swimming in the icy-cold river wearing bear fur coat with no adverse hypothermia effect (frozen to popsicle afterwards in twenty degree temperature). It's like a nature action movie with lack of logic as seen from Hollywood perspective. As for Leonardo's acting, it's really nothing to write home about. It's all method acting aided by the cold and chilly air that affect the actor to nearly and almost overact. I really didn't think his acting Oscar is due for this movie. It's a pity award.  The movie drags way too long. An hour could be cut and nothing would be lost. Pretentious filmmakers think length equals depth, but it's the opposite. They are very shallow in preconception, heavy on sensationalism (some scenes obviously pretentious as if the director is a show-off) and light on logic and reasonable pacing. Inarritu is a total hack who pretends to be an intellectual when he is not, instead he mugs as if he's on par with Kubrick. Cinematography is the only thing that's good about the movie, but still an awfully pretentious movie with no point to comprehend. I checked my watch more than a few times during the movie. It's how restless I felt. Gore doesn't phase me, but Inarritu's directing is the worst and most irritating factor about this movie.  George Miller is very calm, controlled and serenely self-assured in commanding direction in contrast to Inarritu's desperately provocative and bore-you-to-death pretentious approach to filmmaking.  That Miller lost best direction Oscar to this sentimental and lecturing hack Inarritu says a lot about the idiocy of Hollywood. Don't bother because it's so long and indulgent with pretension that Leo's subtly Oscar-bait overreaching method acting cannot compensate for how lousy this movie is, in terms of demerits.  What a piece of crap.  * out of fourWhat a waste of time to watch something so unreal! Unbelievable bad movie! I mean come on, i watched Titanic, and the same guy dies of Hypotermia in 5 minutes of cold water!!! ***spoiler*** Now he not only sleeps on the snow while totally ruined and left to death after a bear attack, he crawls for miles, take swims in a river with snow and ice around, get outside, sleeps a bit more then make a fire from a spark, on the snow, then kill some, then fall off the cliff with a horse and then he shows that he knows how Han Solo saved Luke on planet Hoth from dying. It could be such a good movie if bear killed him at the start. Or at least i wouldn't have wasted so much time watching it...Cold, colorless, dismal, stark, bleak, brutal, dispiriting &amp; ultimately pointless. In real life, Hugh Glass was mauled by a grizzly &amp; left for dead, but managed to drag himself back to a frontier outpost. The cinematic handling of the story in Revenant, however, is straight out of Cormac McCarthy: heavy-handed with funereal music &amp; gray-scale tones throughout, creating an overall impression that the sun rarely ever shone in those mountains in those times. Just watching it becomes a test of endurance. Cold, colorless, dismal, stark, bleak, brutal, dispiriting &amp; ultimately pointless. Perhaps that was how these men actually lived their lives? Maybe that's the point? If there is one? At the end of the film, we're left not even knowing whether Glass, after exacting vengeance on the man who killed his son, lives or dies himself. Or perhaps that doesn't matter? Perhaps none of it matters? Ptui! Worst film I've watched since Deadman.Almost un-bearable pain I went to see "The Revenant" on the day that it was nominated for 12 Oscars, which certainly sets the expectation that it is going to be good ‚Äì and it is. But I saw it described by DiCaprio as an "epic art-house western" and that's a good description. In the same way that I√±√°rritu's "Birdman" (this time last year) was unarguably a brilliant but not very mainstream film, so I think the Oscar buzz will attract a big audience to this movie who may find it a struggle to really enjoy. Because it is bleak¬Ö unremittingly bleak, in terms of the landscape, the weather and the motives of the characters. It is also extremely violent but, unlike "The Hateful Eight" (another film I saw this week that was unremittingly bleak) the violence is much more gritty, realistic and visceral making the drama a lot more compelling. DiCaprio plays "Hugh Glass", an historical figure who was a legendary fur-trapper in the early 1800's and the central figure in this bear-related yarn. Although the story has been re-embroidered over the years, the 'facts' align with the film's basic story (there's a good "Daily Telegraph" article outlining this - see the link on bob-the-movie-man.com). Attacked and pursuing by local natives, Glass's party is striking across woodland when he is viciously attacked by a 500lb Grizzly bear. Although appearing mortally wounded, he is a highly respected individual and so is stretchered up by his boss Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). Unable to proceed further, Henry pays for the mercenary John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) to stay with him, together with his half-Pawnee son Hawk and friend Bridger (Will Poulter), to die in peace. Predictably, Fitzgerald is not to be trusted, and Glass is abandoned in a shallow grave. If this is not enough, for other reasons we won't go into, Glass has even less inclination to keep his fellow trapper on his Christmas card list. Thus is set up a classic revenge movie, with Glass determined to stay alive to enact that revenge despite the enormous odds stacked against him. This is surely DiCaprio's year for his elusive Oscar as he turns in a cripplingly painful performance. It is clear that the suffering on screen is not all acting ‚Äì it cannot be, given the inhospitable conditions in which the crew were filming (in Canada and Argentina). As examples he had to eat raw bison liver as well as suffering a much discussed Han "I thought they smelled bad on the outside" Solo moment. Despite having very few lines to deliver, DiCaprio is on screen for 90% of the time, and it is a bravura performance. Tom Hardy ‚Äì also Oscar nominated ‚Äì is also impressive as the villain of the piece, although for most of the time his lines might have well been delivered through his Bain mask for the sense they made. He is an inveterate mumbler. Domhnall Gleeson's performance is also compelling, adding a degree of goodness and compassion to the film that was so missing from "The Hateful 8". (Gleeson is surely vying this year with Ben Whishaw for the busiest mainstream film appearances after this, "Ex Machina", "Brooklyn" and "Star Wars"). Finally Will Poulter gets a chance to shine in an A-grade mainstream dramatic movie and he well and truly makes that grade. Director Alejandro G. I√±√°rritu has to be commended for eschewing the use of green screens, insisting on live performances and in natural light to boot. Stylistically (and indeed story-wise) the film has many parallels with "Gladiator", with its effective and artistically constructed dream sequences. But the film is not without special effects, and these are phenomenal, most incredibly delivered during the relentless and gruelling bear attack scene: a seamless blend of live animal work and effects that make it horrifically believable. There is also some fantastic camera work (by Emmanuel Lubezki) of the "how the hell did they do that variety". Recalling his work in "Birdman" it's challenging to do single tracking shots of people walking through buildings. To do these same tracking shots during a pitched battle scene is just phenomenal. During one scene in this harrowing sequence at the film's start, the camera is on the ground filming a native galloping towards a victim, then the camera is seamlessly filming the rider as he gallops away. Astonishing. The only area I really didn't care for was the music, by Carsten Nicolai and Ryuichi Sakamoto. A combination of droning strings and (later) some whiny "Ligeti-style" elements, it was in turns intrusive, gloomy and annoying. Music should largely stay in the background to set the mood. This didn't. Overall, this is a masterful film, but it is a slog and not a feel-good film to sit through. It also has significant violence which might not suit all viewers, with the final confrontation in particular being one of the most visceral fight scenes I've seen in years. By the way (I had to look it up) the definition of "revenant" is: noun  1. a person who returns 2. a person who returns as a spirit after death; ghost. Now you know too ‚Äì this public service announcement brought to you by One Mann's Movies! (Please visit the graphical version of this review at http://bob-the-movie-man.com. Thanks.)Stunning Go and see this movie. In the cinema. As soon as possible. Simply put, it is an excellent story of family, revenge, survival, and nature. The Revenant is one of the most beautifully-shot films I have ever seen. I lost count of how many scenes I sat there in utter amazement, which is undoubtedly due to the brilliant directing and spectacular cinematography: there's no shaky-cam, no quick-cut editing, and a lot of incredibly complex shots which appear to have been completed in a single take. If all films were shot similarly to how the Revenant is, then the movie industry would drastically improve. The entire cast did a phenomenal job and they all deserve recognition for their performances; however, if Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't win an Oscar for his breathtaking portrayal of Glass then that will be the single biggest injustice of the year. Do not miss the opportunity to see this masterpiece on the big screen! UPDATE: I've read an unnerving amount of other user's reviews complaining about the plot. I can understand that the plot may seem a little basic or perhaps lacking at times; however, the plot is not what makes this film so excellent, and I feel as though those who failed to recognise this have seriously missed out. You don't just watch the Revenant: you experience it. Every single element from the music to the cinematography is cleverly concocted to draw you into the film and put you alongside the cast in the brutal wintry conditions. If you've not been drawn in due to being too concerned with the premise of the story, then I fear you've missed a truly enthralling and one-of-a-kind cinematic experience. UPDATE TWO: Leo won the Oscar!Unbelievable and way overrated I cannot believe how many people think this is a good movie....watching a guy struggle to survive for 2 hours ...come on people..I know there are not many good movies being made but my word....so many things are unbelievable...the bear attack, carrying a near dead guy out of the wilderness up a mountain...going over a cliff on a horse and not getting hurt...spending long periods of time in freezing cold water.....surviving extreme cold overnight inside a dead horse...my god the list is endless....and for Leo's so called acting don't get me started...a lot of crawling and moaning and groaning....the whole thing was a letdown and really a waste of time...also tell the director to back the camera up a bit on those facial close-ups...they were also ridiculous...trust me save your money and go see The Hateful Eight.Eyecandy "The Revenant" is probably the most beautiful movie I have seen for a long time. This is not only due to the incredible locations, but also to the excellent (and by excellent I mean excellent) camera-work. Frequently I was just blown away by the sheer beauty of the rough terrain of Canada and how it was captured by the crew. However, there are a few drawbacks. Mainly the story (it is a very simple revenge story line) and the dialog (it is basically not existent :D). When I first left the movie I was still blown away by all the great things I mentioned above (I was thinking about a 10/10 rating), but the longer I was outside the movie the more I recognized that "The Revenant" is a film that is incredible entertaining whilst sitting in the cinema, but also a movie I quickly forgot about when being at home again. Still, the movie is definitely a must-see. Your money is well invested!A bit too much and a very unbelievable story. I honestly don't know what to think of this movie. It's good in a way and at the same time awful. To begin with, the idea to the story is interesting. It's set in the 19th century which makes the scenario more complicated than it would be today. But then there is this whole father/son scenario which really makes no sense and seems out of place. There is some back story to it that is scattered out through the film and I understand it's there to add some tension to the movie, but there is no build up to make you feel anything about it and in the end it seems boring and pointless. It is well made though and most of the scenes seems very real and believable. I sometimes grasped the chair grinning cause I really felt the reality and pain in it. The bear attack for one stands out. The acting is very good and the actors do as much as they can with the script they're given, but as much as I believe Di Caprio deserves an Oscar, I really don't think this role was the one. The plot could have been more interesting. It looks a bit like they tried to make another "Deliverance" but failed in character development and gravity of the story. Along the way I lost interest since everything seemed to be based around how everything in the wild hurts, and the main character is hurt a lot. Still he seems to survive anything that happens to him, sometimes in the most obscure ways. At the end I didn't really care whether or not he was going to make it back home, even less if he was going to be able to avenge his son, because nothing felt dangerous anymore. I was just hoping for the movie to end because it felt way too long. They could easily have made this an hour shorter which I think would have made it more exciting and less dragged out. Warning! Spoilers ahead! There were a number of things bothering me about this movie but what bothered me the most is that there is a huge lack of credibility throughout some parts of it, especially since it's supposed to be based on real events:  Mostly I was annoyed by the fact that he seems to take any chance he has to jump into the water and have a swim. Everyone who has been living in a place cold enough for it to snow during the winter knows that falling into ice-cold water when it's that cold outside, is equal to freezing to death if you don't manage to get out of your clothes and get warm somehow. Yet he barely seems to freeze at all. It's snowing and there are ice floes in the water for God's sake! In reality he would have been dead by the time he reached the riverbank, and certainly after his "nap". Seems like the movie makers forgot to do some research about hypothermia.  After the bear attack his foot is clearly broken and points in the wrong direction. Yet he manages to crawl off and swim down the rapids in ice-cold water only to be able to walk out of the river on his now miraculously healed foot.  The only problem to him surviving seems to be the injuries he suffered from the bear attack. I mean he even rides off a cliff and survives the fall only to miraculously survive yet another cold night of snow storms. Why do they eat raw meat when they clearly have made a fire two steps away where they could cook it? It makes no sense. All the lines delivered by the native Americans seemed out of sync for some reason, which is weird since todays technology in syncing picture and audio is quite developed. All in all it's an interesting story but a bit boring and unbelievable way to tell it. I would have bought it if it was a fictional story, but this time it's based on real events. If you want to revel in pain, suffering and misery, and if you like to watch a movie about how hard it was back in the 19th century, please go ahead, but there are better ways to spend your money.Don't waste your time What a waste of a night. Spoiler alert! Here is the whole movie in 30 seconds. A guy almost dies, a guy walks, a guy builds a fire, the guy almost dies again, walks some more, goes for a swim, builds a fire, almost dies, goes for a swim again, builds a fire, makes it back safely, goes back out again, finds a fire, almost dies, makes someone else go for a swim. Looks into the camera deeply. The end. Best supporting actor to the bear. My life would have been better had you finished the job. I'm pretty sure this script was two pages long, and they turned it into a 2.5 hour movie. The closed captioning graphic artist had more words than any one else in the movie.Un r√™ve? Non! I made the mistake of reading up on the life of the real Hugh Glass (the character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio) before seeing the film. What I saw on-screen was a very distorted/Hollywoodized version of his story with lots of unnecessary racism thrown in (because, you know, Hollywood just can't pass up the chance to bash Whitey whenever possible). Inarritu takes a simple survival story and turns it into a violent, gory revenge story. Sensationalism for the sake of sensationalism abounds. So do clich√©s. There is some speculation that the real Hugh Glass may have married a Pawnee Indian woman during a period (which ended a couple of years before the events depicted in the film) when he lived with the tribe. However, there is no surviving documentation, either public records or correspondence to/from Glass, that mentions a wife. In the film, Glass has a Pawnee wife who we see in flashbacks getting murdered by an evil, White soldier because, you know, White people are horrible and Hollywood wants you to know that. The real Hugh Glass had no children. Movie-Glass has a half-Indian son who he coaches to act "invisible" because the (racist) White men they work with will only see his skin color. His son later gets murdered by an evil, White man because, you know, White people are awful and Hollywood wants to make sure you understand that. Real-Glass never killed an army officer. Movie-Glass, it is revealed in flashbacks, once killed an evil, White lieutenant who was trying to murder his very young son because, you know, White people are just terrible and Hollywood will not let you forget that. Real-Glass did not rescue a woman during his arduous journey back to the fort. Movie-Glass not only rescues an Indian woman but he rescues her while she's being raped by an evil, White, French guy because, you know, White people (no matter where they're from) are just horrid and Hollywood will remind you of that as often as possible. Real-Glass was helped along on his odyssey by some friendly Sioux Indians, none of whom were killed by White people in the process. Movie-Glass is helped by one Indian who is later murdered by evil, White, Frenchmen because, you know, White people are reprehensible and in case you still weren't sure yet Hollywood will BLUDGEON YOU OVER THE HEAD WITH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!!! Fabricating a bunch of racist scenarios in order to move the story along and provide impetus for the main character is cheap and lazy screen-writing. Real-Glass did not get any revenge on John Fitzgerald, other than getting his rifle back. Movie-Glass gets a very violent, bloody revenge. Real-Glass eventually let go of his anger and forgave Bridger and Fitzgerald. Movie-Glass has a weird quasi-redemption where he stops short of finishing Fitzgerald off but then sends him on to certain death at the hands of another. So, is that redemption, really? The film goes way overboard depicting Glass as a super-man. I'm sure men were made of sturdier stuff back in the 1820s but when he and the horse hit that tree I just thought, "Oh, COME ON!!" The guy wasn't even fully recovered from getting mauled (and rolled on) by a 300-400 pound grizzly bear yet! And, no, he did not fall off a cliff in real life. Did I mention that the bear attack actually happened in August and Glass reached the fort in October? So, there was no crawling through snow or wading through icy water in freezing temperatures either. How would he not have hypothermia and/or frostbite after weeks of that?! Movie-Glass occasionally has dreams where he hears his dead wife murmuring analogies about trees because nothing screams, "This movie is really, really deep!" like whispered dream-guidance from a dead Native-American. Yes, there is lots of striking cinematography of beautiful scenery. Much has been made of the fact that Inarritu used only natural light and it does work well with the tone of the film. The bear attack is both impressive and horrifying. If you know anything about how to react to a bear attack you will cringe in horror at Glass' stupidity. (Note to screenwriter: bears HIBERNATE in the Winter!) The music is good. I was surprised that DiCaprio won the Golden Globe and I'll be disappointed if he wins the Oscar. He gives a good performance in the film but I just don't think it's an Oscar-caliber role. "The Revenant" is sensational but not in a good way.Wish it was as good as they say it is. I went into this movie with high expectations. I came out feeling like i'd just sat through a long funeral for someone I didn't know, on a hot and humid day.  *********MASSIVE SPOILERS******** I BASICALLY DESCRIBE THE WHOLE MOVIE IN DETAIL ********* The movie started out great with a little action scene and a little bit about the main character (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his son. After that, with very little else about the story or anything to tie viewers into it, DiCaprio is mauled by a bear because for some reason he's in the forest alone after just being raided and destroyed by some Indian tribe, who are looking for some random girl. (maybe i'm missing something but that's about all I took from the beginning of the movie) So the rest of the "Americans" come and rescue DiCaprio from underneath the bear he just killed after it nearly mauled him to death, and for some reason he survives even though in reality he'd probably had lost enough blood at that point to kill three people. The rest of the middle of the movie is watching DiCaprio breathe heavily and crawl around the forest floor with some cinematic shots of snow, and listening to Tom Hardy attempt to cover up his terrible accent by speaking as low as possible. Oh and did I mention DiCaprio has an Indian kid? Yea so he has a kid, the kids mom and tribe was massacred by Americans or French or something like that, and DiCaprio is really close to the kid and vice versa. (Yes it's the predictable average story of revenge) So Tom Hardy kills DiCaprio's kid because the kid doesn't want him to kill his father. Then they leave DiCaprio behind to die (BUT GUESS WHAT??? THE MAIN CHARACTER DIDN'T DIE! WOW! DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE COMING) so he regains strength, gets some support from some random Indian dude who also lost his family, but to another tribe, and then some French dudes who have the girl the other tribe is looking for, find and kill the other Indian dude, but don't see DiCaprio apparently even though he was in a giant wood shelter with a fire going. DiCaprio becomes hero and saves the girl, kills some french dudes, and rides off to get his "revenge" And you know what happens next?? HE GETS HIS REVENGE!@!!!@#!@ WOW WEE WHAT AN ADVENTURE  Movie ends with the Indian tribe who got their girl back finishing off Tom Hardy with a hatchet or knife, and they walk past Leo and leave him alone.  Seriously though, I don't understand the hype around this movie. It WAS Oscar bait, because 90% of the movie is Leo breathing heavy, acting as injured and in pain as possible crawling around grunting and moaning.  The only good thing about the movie was the cinematic shots and scenes, but nothing else. Insanely bland and generic story with a good setting.  I actually like most of DiCaprio's movies, and I think he should've had an Oscar a long time ago, but I don't feel it should be for this movie.What's a beautiful plate with nothing on it? If ever there was a case of style over substance, The Revenant is it. Visually stunning, yes, but films have always been about more than that. If something nice to look at is what you want, go and stare at a painting or a photo for 2 and a half hours. This isn't a bad film in the way that Adam Sandler films are bad, it's a bad film because there is nothing (bar the visuals) to enjoy. It is so unrelentingly grim, with zero character development, It left me asking, am I meant to care? As the film opens with the slaughter of half the group, it's a pretty brutal scene, but with no impact, as we weren't even introduced to them. This serves as a recurring problem throughout the running time. The only thing interesting thing about this movie is that it serves as a metaphor for DiCaprio's own struggle to earn an Oscar. His character goes through so much Hell to survive, has everything thrown at him, and its' almost like Leo is pleading to the Academy - 'Look, look! See what I'm willing to put myself though?!'To be fair, it paid off in that respect.Linear survival tale in which revenge becomes secondary I haven't seen all of Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu's films. Those I have seen were excellent or at least very good: "Amores Perros", "21 Grams", "Babel" and "Birdman". When I saw the trailer for "The Revenant", needless to say, I immediately thought it had tremendous potential and got pretty hyped up about it. It showed gorgeous, naturally-lit cinematography, dynamic directing, a historical depiction of the early 19th century savagery, and what seemed to be quite a visceral performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. I thought that, with I√±√°rritu's name attached to it, this would be a much deeper film than what I ended up watching, at least in its depictions of history, first nations, and in its ability to exploit classic themes such as revenge and survival. Without saying that "The Revenant" is an empty shell (although a gorgeous one), I√±√°rritu's film fails to impress when it comes to depth, thanks to a linear and predictable narrative structure, one dimensional characters, and a revenge plot that never manages to be compelling to the audience. DiCaprio offers a demanding, physical performance with very little dialogue, but his character, always in survival mode, never reached me emotionally. All the agony grunting and wincing, enhanced by the costumes and make up sure make the character believable, but the script never allows the character to develop or to unfold anything that goes beyond an extremely narrow range of emotions. Very unfortunate. Tom Hardy is okay as the antagonist, another character that suffers from his development being jilted by the writers. This is an unfortunate mistake to make in a revenge-themed film, where the antagonist is supposed to nourish the quest. In "The Revenant", the antagonist is barely a background character that will leave the audience almost emotionless and neutral. The directing (Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu) and cinematography (Emmanuel Lubezki) are the highlights here. Visually, "The Revenant" is flawless. The framing of the shots, the camera movements and the snowy, low-saturation imagery are all gorgeous. Some scenes are absolutely incredible to watch. Editing-wise, Stephen Mirrione could have cut a few corners here and there. And this is coming from a movie enthusiast who sure appreciates a slow-paced film. Watching Hugh Glass walk through the endless forest was great, but you do see at least a dozen very-low angle shots of trees. They're just as beautiful as they're eerie, but slightly redundant at times.  Overall, "The Revenant" is not a bad film. It just isn't a great one either. It does have its moments. Definitely a case of style over substance, "The Revenant" disappoints both as a revenge tale and as a meditation on the savagery of both man and nature. Plot-wise, its flaws keep "The Revenant" in a linear survival tale in which revenge becomes secondary. Too bad.Literally nothing new It is a travesty. The scenery shots are boring and carelessly tacked on to create a disparity between the violence and serenity of nature I assume but it's really badly done. I think it's supposed to be arty? If you watch the trailer, google some pics of Canadian landscape and youtube that scene from star wars with the tauntaun you have basically watched the movie. Don't waste your money. It is soulless Oscar fodder and brings nothing new to cinema so if you want to watch the same old story of a guy surviving against all odds because revenge and manpain are powerful driving forces, go for it. You'll probably enjoy it. If you want to watch something with beautiful editing or scenery or costume design, there are way better films out there that do all of this a lot better and have a more original storyline/progressive way of showing that storyline. I found it very dull and Leo does not deserve an Oscar. Maybe Tom Hardy does. But Mad Max was better so he should win it for that.Silly and painfully dull Okay, okay, it's not really a one out of ten, more like a three, but the overall score is way too high and needs compensating. As many other reviewers have noted the acting and cinematography are uniformly excellent. Otherwise, it's both boring and ludicrous. The first twenty minutes are pretty good, but after the bear attack it becomes both silly and tedious. Indeed it's sillier than the film where Liam Neeson gets chased around the wilderness by a pack of wolves, and at least that was quite exciting. The biggest problem by far was that the DiCaprio character continued to live. In sub zero temperatures if any human, but especially one that's been severely weakened, is plunged into freezing water and then is unable to get dry he will die of hypothermia. What he won't be able to do is go back into the freezing water in order to build a horseshoe of rocks under the water so he can trap fish. This was just one instance of many. A horse's chest cavity is simply not big enough to accommodate a fully grown man, Leo fires his barrel loading pistol twice in quick succession which is impossible. Then there were all the continuity problems. Leo gets washed downstream but appears to arrive at a location which is at a higher altitude. Sometimes there's lots of snow on the trees, then in the next shot barely any snow at all. It's just a mess. But the worst thing was how long it took to achieve relatively little. Just lots of suffering for DiCaprio and boredom for me.Do not waste your money!!!!. Revenant was the worst movie I've ever seen. If you want to pay $7 to watch almost 3 hours of Leonardo DiCaprio sleeping and breathing heavily in the snow, it's the perfect movie for you. It was also really inaccurate as the dude Leo was playing was somehow very literate and wrote in present day English. This would not have been the case. it was really unnecessary to have this detail in it.  The only enjoyable part for me was the symbolism of Leo's rebirth as he was coming out of the horse that he was in due to the weather.  I am only writing the last two things because i can't upload the first paragraph unless i have 10 lines.  But seriously. Do not waste your money on this movie. Pirate it if you really wanna see it, but even then, it isn't even worth the time.Some people go for a walk in the woods. Story line: Some people go for a walk in the woods. It drags on for a bit.

The end.Honest filmmaking and incredible wide angle cinematic detail Smooth camera-work, long takes, wide angle, natural light, great cast and costumes. The story takes us on a journey and puts us right there in the harsh conditions. In full HD on a nicely calibrated display, you are in for a treat. I love it when cinema isn't pretentious. The camera isn't hiding anything, it's simply showing the scene and background as it exists. This movie achieves a direct signal to the viewer. Uncontaminated, unfiltered, very few gimmicks, genuine and poetic. The only part I felt went a bit too far into fiction territory was the horse over the cliff scene. A bit too Hollywood, but forgivable. Everyone involved in making this film are very lucky to be part of such a special motion picture.Beautiful and Terrifying Beautiful. All the elements of filmmaking were outstanding. It was very tense. Leonardo DiCaprio is great. Tom Hardy is great. The one takes were cool, especially with its one takes. The action scenes were incredibly tense, violent and gory. The make-up, visual effects, costumes, acting, cinematography and directing were phenomenal.The Revenant Review I'm probably going to get some flak for the rating I am giving The Revenant, but I didn't think it was as good as everyone said it was. Stick around and see why. Synopsis: While exploring the uncharted wilderness in 1823, legendary frontiersman Hugh Glass sustains injuries from a brutal bear attack. When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home while avoiding natives on their own hunt. Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald, the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him. Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy Director: Alejandro G. Inarritu Okay, if anyone knows the real story of this movie is based off of, then you know that Hugh Glass did not exact his revenge on the men who left him for dead. First thing, it wasn't the dead of winter when he was mauled, it was actually in the middle of the summer. His son wasn't killed by anyone, his son actually lived a full life. These are just two of the many things that have been changed. As I do understand why the film makers took the liberties with the story, I don't think they needed to take it that far. And truthfully, that is the main reason I gave the movie a 7. The reason I gave it a 7 is because of how slow paced the movie was. Although it added to the tone of the movie, it just played out too long. The movie was only two and a half hours long, but until the last thirty minutes it felt like four hours. Adding that I constantly had to keep lowering and raising my volume didn't help. There are a lot of good things though. Even though I didn't like the changes they did make to the story, I still love this story. I wish they would have kept it the real ending where Glass forgave the two men who left him. But, the story is still a tale of survival. The man had to go through a lot to walk up to the men and say what he had to say. Alejandro is a great director. I absolutely love his movies, especially Babel and Biutiful. This is probably one of his not so good movies, but still better than most of his movies. Can't wait to see what he has next. Do I think Leo deserved the Oscar for this movie? No I don't. Tom on the other hand should have won. He stole the show, once again. I honestly think the Academy gave Leo the award for all the years they passed him up. He did a decent job in this movie, but he didn't do anything to extreme like he has done in movies like Wolf of Wall Street, The Aviator, Gangs of New York, or The Departed. Geez, I never realized he deserved the Oscar for movies he did with Scorsese Final Thoughts: Even though I don't like the idea of them changing the story quite a bit I do believe this movie is a watchable movie, hands down.  Rating: 7 out of 10"The Revenant" leaves audiences stunned, unsettled by grizzly, authentic portrayal Icy water trickles gently over the rocks. All is quiet. As the camera tilts up and pans to the right, the barrel of a gun creeps out from behind a tree. Two armed hunters are now visible, moving with caution over the steady flow of the stream. A nearby gunshot shatters the calm. The men stop. Another shot. Screams of terror and fury fill the air as the two men return to their hunting party. Arikara Indians gallop around the camp of fur trappers. Their arrows whiz past the two men, piercing the skulls of others around them. A small group of survivors flees the Arikara. Reaching a boat offshore, the remaining trappers drift down the Missouri River, battered and defeated, carrying only a fraction of the beaver furs they'd trapped over the past few months. This opening scene from "The Revenant" captures the brutality exhibited in the true story of its protagonist Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), a legendary frontiersman and fur trapper in the 1820s. Following the slaughtering of trappers at the beginning of the film, Glass guides the surviving group back to its outpost, Fort Kiowa. As Glass is scouting ahead he is attacked by a grizzly bear and mauled to the edge of death. Finding Glass underneath the dead beast, captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) leaves him in the care of his half-native son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) and John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), as it seems that Glass will succumb to his wounds. After a failed attempt to smother Glass, Fitzgerald kills Hawk, buries Glass alive and deceives Bridger about his actions as they press on toward Fort Kiowa. Determined to find Fitzgerald, Glass uses his wit and skill to survive and sets out on a 200-mile path of vengeance across the Northern Plains of America, and you are with him every step of the way. You squirm in your seat as Glass cauterizes his own wounds. You taste the blood and scales of the raw fish as Glass rips it open with his teeth. You lose your appetite for that next handful of popcorn as Glass guts a horse and uses its carcass as a sleeping bag.  The authenticity of "The Revenant" is not only the product of DiCaprio's dedication, but also of the entire cast and crew. Director Alejandro G. Inarritu was unwavering about filming in strictly natural light, which gave the cast and crew a mere 90 minutes of shooting time each day. Inarritu and his team journeyed for hours in minus 25 degree weather to locations in the Canadian and Argentinian mountains. The production ran five months over schedule and $35 million over budget, but the hell that the cast and crew endured was not in vain. The cinematography is masterful. The close ups are so close at times that DiCaprio's breath fogs up the lens, further intensifying the emotional impact of his performance. The landscape choices and use of all natural light result in breathtaking shots such as one scene when Fitzgerald and Bridger are keeping warm by the fire. As darkness falls, sparks dance upward off of the flames; the camera angle shows them gently float toward the heavens and vanish into the twinkling of the night sky. "The Revenant" is nominated for 12 Academy Awards, the most at this year's ceremony. Its direction is nearly flawless, its performances, unsettling. But above all, Inarritu paints a captivating portrait of human suffering and the incredible resiliency of a man with a heart of vengeance.Beautiful cinematography The visual is breathtaking and so most of my rating has gone on that aspect of the film. I felt the length of the film was too long for such a straightforward story-line. The acting was faultless, the setting gloomy but stunning and the period of history compelling but just far too long.Technically accomplished, but left me a bit cold. This is really more of a 6.5 out of 10, but maybe I'm just splitting hairs. The cinematography is amazing to the point of being distracting. It's as if Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu, upon realizing that we have the means to shoot a scene of Leonardo Dicaprio being mauled by a bear in extended, agonizing close-up, decided that every scene should be shot in that way. Maybe I'm overthinking things, but that ended up taking me out of the action. The bear is obviously CG, and since we know that director Innaritu and cinematographer Emmaneul Lubezki are using some digital trickery to make the whole thing appear to be one seamless shot, what's the point? I almost think that scene would have been more effective had it consisted of separate shots, so that a real bear could be employed in long shots, with cuts to a close-up of an animatronic paw crushing Leo or something like that. I should probably talk about the plot now. The story concerns a couple of fur trappers on the Western frontier in the 19th century, who are set upon by violent Natives and have to turn back. When one of them (Leonardo Dicaprio, resorting to masochistic extremes in order to win that Oscar) has a heated debate with a grizzly over which of them deserves to continue breathing, the group leaves him for dead. Tom Hardy plays another member of the trapper group, and he, rather than the bear, is the true villain of the piece. I won't give away what he does, suffice to say that if it weren't for his performance, my rating would be at least two stars lower. This isn't a bad movie. I know I'm being snarky, but it really isn't. That said, I liked Innaritu more when his head wasn't quite so far up his own ass. "Babel" might overreach somewhat, but it has a lot more to say than this bloated film. The scenes with Leo forced to fend for himself in the wilderness verge on misery porn. There is something inherently thrilling about watching people survive on limited resources (see "Castaway" for a superior example of this). This is the kind of film where I can admire certain parts more than I can say I like the whole. Those tracking shots are impressing, sure. There are some fantasy/dream sequences that are well-shot, but that I can't make head or tail of. The sheer physical torment that Dicaprio must have put himself through for this role is admirable, but then again, he was so much more fun in "The Departed". I just wish the film weren't so dead-set on being great that it sometimes forgets to be good.Boring This movie was so hyped but ended up rather boring. For most of the movie, nothing happens at all. It could have been 1-hour long and we wouldn't miss a thing. Di Caprio's performance was OK, but in my opinion he had many better movies, including Inception, Departed, Wolf of Wall Street... I think they gave him "Mercy Oscar" because he deserved it several times in the past, but didn't get it.Ending Great scenery but terribly gory! I. Liked the movie ending better as Glass gets his revenge! The ending is different in movie! Fitzgerald gets killed in movie as we see him floating down the river. However he gets away free in the book never to be seen again!! And even if it's an illusion Glass gets to see his wife again? I was wondering why Hollywood chose to have a son for Glass?Very intriguing Revenant, someone who has come back basically from the dead. This applies to many people in life that make a dramatic return when not being on the "scene" for a long period of time, as well as an emergence. A revenant is present in the movie business as well. Many actors dream of winning the coveted Academy Award. Despite being nominated for the award four times previously, Leonardo DiCaprio could never win one despite his most famous works. Some of those on the list include Titanic, Shutter Island, The Wolf of Wall Street, Django Unchained, Catch Me If You Can, The Great Gatsby, Inception, and even Romeo + Juliet. Nevertheless, he was able to achieve what many actors dream of, which is to capture an Academy Award. This would be his first, and for a movie made in 2015, which portrayed him in a whole different role than what he usually plays. This movie that is so hyped up is called "The Revenant." This is the tale of courage against the odds of nature, and the determination and grit that one gets from within. One thing to note, as well, is that this movie was based on a true story of an American frontiersman. There were many good movies worth noting in 2015, but none could compared to this one. Directed by Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu, "The Revenant" is a must watch even though it was made it 2015 due to the awesome plot, the unbelievable acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, and the great cinematography showing the beautiful landscape of Argentina and Canada. The tale that Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu got the attention of many audiences with the story of Hugh Glass. Surprisingly this is based on a true story that happened many, many years ago. The story may seem a bit cheesy with the fact that the protagonist overcomes many obstacles within nature. It is also a story of revenge, and I√±√°rritu reshapes the famed Hugh Glass to a character that everyone can get behind and support, sort of like Rudy. This movie also shows survival, which is captured as Glass does and many others did some actions that shows what one must do to survive in the wilderness. I√±√°rritu draws people to this story, and it hits people on an emotional level, which separates this movie from the competition. An actor as eloquent in his craft as Leonardo DiCaprio should be rewarded for nailing a role that was unlike others. The usual characters that DiCaprio portrays is the handsome stud, most of the time having a decent amount of money, that all the girls fall in love with and the guys are jealous of. This is true for his films like Romeo + Juliet, The Wolf of Wall Street, The Great Gatsby, Titanic, and Inception. In The Revenant, DiCaprio plays a scruffy, unattractive, wild frontiersman that at first glance looks nothing like the DiCaprio we all know. Playing this character also meant that doing some gross, gnarly stuff that a person would never imagine DiCaprio doing. Only a really strong actor can play roles that break their usual role norms, and this is what DiCaprio does to make The Revenant one of the best movies. Earth is such a beautiful place with many wonders all over, and I√±√°rritu captures them in South America and Canada. It is very noteworthy that the conditions in which the shots were filmed was inhospitable especially the parts in Canada. The movie was about a frontiersman and his survival in the wilderness, and the rough conditions were caught nicely. However, the beauty of the landscape was shown despite all the snow and mist. The last scenes that were shot in Argentina had to be the best I've seen in a while. Even though this was towards the end and not the main location like how Canada was, the landscape and the terrain that they filmed at were jaw droppingly good. Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu captured both the beauty and the dark side of Mother Nature elegantly in this masterpiece that leaves audiences in awe. If you have never watched this movie, you must. It has aspects that almost everyone can enjoy whether you are intrigued by cinematography, an award-winning actor, or a compelling story.Very hard Leonardo DiCaprio First of all, Leonardo DiCaprio is very hard, very hard, in order to obtain the Oscar prize, even in this movie is ugly, black bear, if not for the eighty-eighth Oscar prize in Leonardo DiCaprio's words, is really Providence will not forgive after all he has worked hard for a long time. The film also can have a super fun, Chinese can release really is the gospel.'The Revenant' truly nails the battle between man and nature in what I believe will be one of the most studied films of the 21st century. Though the acting is undoubtedly some of the best I've seen from Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy (two of the finest actors alive today) the true stars of the film are its visionary cinematographer (Emmanuel Lubezki) and director (Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu), who between 'Birdman' (my favorite film of 2014) and 'The Revenant' have just rewritten the book on their perspective talents. I kept thinking to myself, "this looks like a Terrance Malick film", which has everything to do with Lubezki's work with Malick on the acclaimed 'The Tree of Life' and the grossly overlooked 'The New World', which remains my favorite historical love story to date. A warning to those squeamish towards violence, 'The Revenant' is brutal; placing the audience in the heart of the battle to the point where you can smell the death and decay. By contrast, I've never seen more breathtaking panoramic shots of nature on the silver screen. 'The Revenant' truly nails the battle between man and nature in what I believe will be one of the most studied films of the 21st century.Visually an Experience The Revenant is based in part on the exploits of Hugh Glass where we see Leonardo DiCaprio as Glass, a Scots-American soldier in the early 19th century. Glass has son (Forrest Goodluck) by an absent native woman, and something about this, or his basic authority, triggers the bitter resentment of fellow hunting party member John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). Quickly within several key moments of the film, wee see that Glass is suddenly mauled by a bear, and Fitzgerald wants to leave him behind. Later another member of the hunter's team Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) is somehow convinced to go along with that, although he later claims not to have understood Fitzgerald, and we believe him. The Renevant besides it's well visuals and great acting from the leads DiCaprio and Hardy, the films comes off rather boring and not as exciting or entertaining as a whole, as it is being praise for. Yes, the acting makes the film passable and the cinematography is well done, with great shots of the outside. Though in it's story arc, the film does not capitalize as it should. There were not many twists or turns which keeps the audience prepared and waiting for, unfortunately. Mainly due to the film's long running time (two hours 36 minutes), at certain points it becomes dull and almost predictable. The ending is quite well done, as expected.Piece of Art Personally i was aware what to expect going to the movies. Alejandro I√±√°rritu and Leonardo Di Caprio. The director who made some cinematic history with "Birdman" (besides the German one-take-movie ¬ÑVictoria"). On his side everybody's darling and environmentalist (Thank you for that!) Leo. I saw the teaser trailer and i was convinced: this will be big! The pictures: raw, visually stunning. The camera: supports calm, breathing and oppressive moments; follows impressive perspectives, for example an American Indian on his horse riding straight into a battle. The music: disturbing and overwhelming, cautious and imposing. Somewhere i heard, some find the film too brutal, too long, or say the story is too simple. I answer you this: The raw violence in this case is a great tool to show the suffer and the anger of the characters. The length of the movie is just fitting. It takes just as much time as it needs to lead you into a world of pain and the demand of vengeance. A desire which suppresses the hurt of loss, drives a man's ungovernable will to live, who believes that revenge is everything he has left. More to the ¬Ñsimple" story: In beautiful, powerful and wordless scenes - the memories of our protagonist - lies a past soaked by identity and love, between treason and humanity. It's up to the audience to fill the gaps of Glass' past, it demands your full attention and emotions. Last but not least: The message, free to go. A confessing democratic will maybe question the proved judiciary seeing the loner with his vigilante justice. And someone who considers vengeance the same as punishment may will recognize that even revenge won't bring back any losses. So my advice is, take some time to watch this piece of art! Thanks! Need to mention - trivia: Leo ate real bison liver to be as much authentic as he can for his performance and the movie. The bear sequence is a cinematic highlight although in this age of CGI overloaded movies.Beautiful, brutal, gritty, dramatic, emotional The Revenant is the most beautiful film I have seen, all year. This film is the epitome of visual storytelling, this film is pure visual storytelling and it has beautiful cinematography, this film really blew me away and I was incredibly exited when I saw the trailer, It looked amazing and I was not disappointed. The acting in this film is more than just acting, they became these characters and I believed they were who they were portraying on screen. It was a beautiful experience watching this film because I knew a lot of effort was put into this film, everything from the directing, acting, cinematography, the score, the realism is on point and I love how everything came together and formed a beautiful piece of cinema. The film is directed by Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu, cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Will Poulter, Domhnall Gleeson and Forrest Goodluck. As soon as I knew Emmanuel Lubezki was the cinematographer I already knew I was going to get a gorgeous film and all the actors were very strong and the director was also incredibly good so everything was already in place, it was destined for greatness. The camera-work in this film is so good, the camera flows through the scenes and you feel one with the film, It is incredibly well shot and scenes go on for the right amount of time and everything hits the right beats.

This film tells the story of a fur tradesman, Hugh Glass who gets abandoned by his group and has to witness get his son killed, when he gathers up enough strength he goes out to try and find the man who took away his son and almost his life. This film is as authentic as you can get with Hollywood film as every shot in this film is real, not CGI and they used natural lighting and used the natural resources they had with them, I find that incredible that a director would go through all that hassle just to make the film look as amazing as it does, props to the actors who has to perform under such terrible whether conditions (it was worth it as Leo got an Oscar, finally). The minimal dialogue in this film helps in building characters as you mostly get a lot of emotional expression through their acting and the visuals, a lot of it is visual, not very focused on the dialogues. This film is incredibly violent and brutal, you see this man fight against the forces of nature whilst also using it to find his way through the wilderness to eventually find the man he is after. The acting in this film is very well done. I just wish this film was shorter, it did feel stretched out a bit but apart from that this film is perfect for me. I definitely recommend to those who love beautiful looking films, you enjoy a gritty adventure film as well as a dramatic story about a man on a journey to avenge his sons death and reconnect with his group. The moment Leonardo meets Tom Hardy's character their fight scene is brutal and it is a bloody mess, you feel disgusting after watching this film because of how real it feels and how grotesque it is. The bear scene was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen, I am so confused by how they managed to achieve that effect but they did it and it looks great, I am so surprised by how amazingly well done this film is.  This film is beautiful, this is definitely cinematic history being made.Another I√±√°rritu masterpiece to follow 'Birdman.' Director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu, known most recently for directing "Birdman," has created a visually stunning movie of survival and revenge. It's clearly the fruit of much labor on behalf of the director and all the actors. It shows and works in the movie. Unfortunately the audience has to labor as well through a lot of slow scenes, some of which are probably unnecessary. The two main roles are played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy. Their characters are rough, gritty, and at times difficult to watch. There are some scenes in this film that made even me feel like hiding my eyes. Is this any surprise since this movie is about frontiersmen surviving in sub zero temperatures. There are Indians, hatchets, musket type rifles, buffalo, and bears. Aside: This film contains the most frightening bear maul I've ever seen on film. Even Paul Bunyan would recoil. Short synopsis: Hugh Glass is a frontiersman alongside Jon Fitzgerald and a group of rough ones. They are making their way through the snowy forest terrain. Through a course of events and a bear mauling of Hugh, the story becomes one of survival. Hugh is determined to survive the attack and take revenge on those who abandoned him for dead. My conclusions: There is a signature drum soundtrack but not as extensive as the one in "Birdman." The camera pans and zooms are also signature of I√±√°rritu. It's a long sit but I can say that fans of "Birdman" and westerns about revenge will probably really enjoy this movie. The cinematography is incredible. My wife and I actually felt cold in some of the scenes even though we had a raging fire going with the heater on. Movie lovers and reviewers especially will enjoy this movie. I foresee Oscar nods. It's one of the best of 2015 for sure. I did find it overly long and belabored at times though and that made it lose a star with me.Gorgeously Shot; DiCaprio Suffers for his Awards but Hardy Steals the Show So Leonardo DiCaprio finally wins an Academy Award for his acting and all he had to do was suffer some of the most extreme filming conditions and choke down some raw meat. I suppose, if nothing else, his dedication to the role is deserving of the praise, even if Tom Hardy completely outshines him in THE REVENANT. The film comes from director Alejandro I√±√°rritu, who delivered one of my personal favorite films in 2014 with BIRDMAN. It's (very) loosely based on the true tale of fur-trapper Hugh Glass with DiCaprio in the main role. The film is set in the early nineteenth century on the American frontier where Glass and his half-Pawnee son are acting as guides for a team of trappers when they're attacked by a raiding party of Arikara warriors. With many of their men dead and the Arikara on their trail, the men are forced to hike through the wilderness to the closest fort and Glass is the man to get them there. Unfortunately he's attacked by a grizzly bear and left mangled, so the team decides it best to leave a couple of men behind to tend to the fatally injured Glass while they continue on. Once Glass succumbs to his wounds, the men are instructed to give him a proper burial and start for the fort themselves. One of the men (Hardy) who volunteers to remain behind (there was a cash bonus in it for him, you see) gets a little impatient and opts to bury Glass prematurely, killing Glass's son in the process when he interferes. Helplessly witnessing the events, Glass summons his remaining strength to go after the man who murdered his son and sets off on an impossible quest across the freezing wilderness, injured and alone. THE REVENANT is a sort of film experience. The plot is very simple: a quest for revenge. There aren't exactly a lot of twists and turns to the story; it's very straightforward. It's the experience of watching Glass undergo just an insane amount of trials and tribulations to accomplish his goal that I find so mesmerizing. It is two and a half hours of DiCaprio dragging his dying, mutilated Glass through freezing temperatures while scrounging for heat and food with an angry Arikara war party on his tail. I really want to know how much of this movie was done for real because DiCaprio does some pretty gnarly things for this role. I believe I'd read somewhere that he'd really chowed on some raw fish, scales and all, for the scene where he fishes one out of the river and maybe even the hunk o' bison he very visibly gags down later on. But¬Öwhat about that horse scene? I know I√±√°rritu was dedicated to capturing realism in the struggle, and that horse looked real enough. I don't know. If it was special effects, congratulations to the SFX crew that put that together because, wow, you could've fooled me. Leonardo DiCaprio must've really wanted that Oscar because, regardless of what's real and what's SFX, he went through some rough times filming this movie. I√±√°rritu is one of the most artistic modern filmmakers I'm aware of and I'm sure the production was rough on all parties involved to get it right. But it all serves a purpose, as THE REVENANT is one of the most beautiful (and grueling) films you'll find from 2015, a year when big budget CG blockbusters dominated the market. Most visually remarkable films nowadays spend countless hours in front of a green screen; meanwhile, I√±√°rritu is out in the wilderness using natural light to present an amazing tale of survival. Well, survival and revenge. Glass isn't just dragging himself back to civilization because he refuses to die in a half-finished hole in the ground. He's hunting the man who murdered his son, and that man is Tom Hardy. Hardy, who maybe should've won that Oscar himself for best supporting actor here, gets the far more interesting character. His man, John Fitzgerald, is at a bad point in his life. All he's got going for himself is the money he stands to make on this fur-trapping expedition and the Arikara threw a wrench into that plan. All he wants is to get the furs back to the fort and get his paycheck and Glass, unlucky as he may have been with that bear attack, is jeopardizing all of it. His motivations are clear though he's far from sympathetic. He's racist toward the natives (and therefore butts heads with Glass's half-Indian son long before their final confrontation) and only worried about his own needs. Once you become accustomed to his mush-mouthed dialogue delivery Hardy steals the show with his performance and I started finding myself more interested in the movie when it cut away from Glass's struggles to check in on Fitzgerald and his scheme. DiCaprio is great in the movie but, no matter what movie or role, I always look at him and see DiCaprio; Hardy is the total opposite, disappearing into whatever role he's performing. THE REVENANT acts as a solid comparison between the two critically-lauded actors and gives me further appreciation for Hardy and his talent. Between the two of them and I√±√°rritu's filmmaking prowess, THE REVENANT comes highly recommended from me. It can feel its length at times but even when the pace slows there's always something incredible just around the corner to recapture your interest. Moreover, you get a good sense for the blood, sweat, and tears that went into making the film from the entire cast and crew. Give it a watch.Beautiful, but... "The Revenant" is like necessary evil; it is so easy to admire but very difficult to love. It resides in a mundane world notwithstanding being very beautiful to look at. Perhaps that is the vision of director Alejandro G. I√±√°rritu ‚Äì to construct a picture that is formidable in its filmmaking and at the same time paints Hugh Glass's (Leonardo DiCaprio) steadfastness and his legendary journey for survival. Either way, I still regard his previous work which is "Birdman" to be the superior movie overall. It was built on a very simple tale ‚Äì a son is being killed, and the protagonist goes all-out to hunt down the criminal. Although the movie has 'revenge' elements in it, it is best interpreted as a survival-drama instead of a revenge-drama picture. DiCaprio delivered a performance which led to his first Oscar win while Tom Hardy's act as the movie's villain Fitzgerald was just astonishing. Tom Hardy is no doubt one of the best actors working in Hollywood today where we've seen him in lots of movies and had been in all sorts of characters. Will Poulter was great too, but I can't say the same for Domhall Gleeson's performance. The film's cinematography led by Emmanuel Lubezki is eye-popping, despite being shot on digital instead of film. It is still as solid as it tried to be. Performances are great, cinematography is great, although DiCaprio's historic triumph will overshadow the movie's other achievements. I can understand the film's difficulty in entering the top 5% of critics' choice last year. This ugly-pretty picture adopted a serious tone that seemed to be too joyless. "The Revenant" is clearly not for the masses. The rudiments of its ideas are to sculpt an artistic, expressive art, but primarily not to entertain. The accolades that had gotten the film's great success is surely, I guessed now, is well-deserved. (Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)LOvely An inadequate script is superbly executed in The Revenant, turning half a movie's worth of material into an exhausting, if occasionally transcendent, trek that congratulates the viewer for having survived its icy blasts of testosterone. Based in part on the exploits of Hugh Glass‚Äîor at least on several books about him‚Äîthe two-and-a-half-hour film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Glass, a Scots-American trapper in the early 19th century. (He was called Zach Bass when Richard Harris played the same character in 1971's Man in the Wilderness.) Slogging through the chilly Rockies, our guy is scouting for a fur-swapping outfit loosely held together by a quasi-officer played by Domhnall Gleeson. Glass has an almost-grown son (Forrest Goodluck) by an absent native woman, and something about this, or his basic authority, triggers the bitter resentment of fellow hunting party member John Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy, with an accent so thick-tongued I still have no idea what he said about anything. Far from the main party, Glass is suddenly mauled by a bear in the most stomach-churning scene of the season, and Fitzgerald wants to leave him behind. The much younger Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) is somehow convinced to go along with that, although he later claims not to have understood Fitzgerald, and we believe him. The gravely wounded scout then suffers one depredation after another in his quest to return to civilization, and of course to wreak revenge on the dudes who deserted him. In real life, Glass never saw Fitzgerald again, and Bridger went on to become a famous explorer. But director Alejandro G. I√±√°rritu, having survived his bout of urban satire with Birdman, isn't content to let nature inflict its wintry drama on our hero's body. Sure, Leonardo's character has to cut open a horse and crawl inside it to survive a snowstorm, but he also needs multiple foes of the human kind. That's a shame, because the real drama here is in the landscapes captured by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki‚Äîmostly in Alberta, then Argentina, when they ran out of snow. The movie labours hard to capture the humbling spirituality of The Tree of Life and other Terrence Malick films, but its sometimes astounding beauty remains surprisingly shallow.A beautifully constructed yet slightly imperfect achievement! I find a large amount of awe when it comes to the career of Leonardo DiCaprio. I cannot think of a film hr has been in which could be considered terrible. He has consistently proved that his ability to act is stellar whatever he may be. Whether that be a corrupted stockbroker, a man on the run from the FBI or even an undercover cop, Leo can surely do an unprecedented amount of good! Today, I want to focus on one of his latest works. In which he plays folk legend Hugh Glass; who has a taste for revenge. I'm talking about his Academy Award role in "The Revenant". This masterfully constructed film comes from 3-time Oscar winner Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who most people will know him for his work on Birdman (Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) and Babel. His film the previous year stole 4 of the big awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Writing (all of which I believe should have gone to Grand Budapest Hotel but that is beside the point. I want to start with my dislikes, because it's always best to get the negatives out of the way in order to have the good stuff in the end. OK, even as a casual watcher when I watched it for the 4th time, I began to see some continuity issues, believe me, these are tiny issues but they are things I have picked up on since I have begun studying film. But for a person who only watched to enjoy, then this will go completely unnoticed. I also find some scenes to be completely unnecessary, although I won't go into what those scenes are, if you have watched it or plan to watch it, then you will understand the scenes I'm talking about. Now, let's get into the good stuff, probably the best part about this film is the use of lighting. Every single shot has been created with natural lighting, which gives the film a beautifully striking yet slightly dull colour pallet. Bright whites, dark blues/purples and thick blacks give the film a visually striking and gorgeous look. It also doesn't hurt that the cinematography is stunning as well. Every shot is beautiful and has been thought about in great detail, the open plains, deep forests and soaring mountain ranges of North America truly are a spectacle. And this all comes from Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki, who is also known for his work on both Birdman as well as Children of men. Let's take a look at performances. I cannot start to talk about the performances in The Revenant without mentioning my thoughts on 2015's Best Actor winner. I personally believe that year, Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Dalton Trumbo blew the competition away. Despite my thoughts on who I believe should have won, I still think Leo is spectacular in this film, Leo has most definitely set the bat for acing in this type of film genre. A leading actor cannot be amazing without an excellent supporting actor, and Tom Hardy secures that place masterfully. Once again, I did not agree with Mark Rylance Oscar steal in 2015, despite it not being an awful performance. Mark may have taken the award, but Tom deserved it even more than he did, his character is distasteful and sinister, and Tom captures this essence beautifully; it truly is an unforgettable performance. I would overall give this film a 9/10, it is by no means perfect, but what is here is so interesting and engaging, the flaws die down in the grand scheme of the overall film.Emotional roller-coaster of a movie - full spectrum of humanity explored, from the brutal ruthless streak we have to the mercy and love we can express. I have to say there were more than a few moments that brought a tear to my eye. Glass had tragically lost his Native Indian wife, then was left alone to bring up his mixed-race son in such harsh circumstances. His son (Hawk) was all he had and then he loses his son in such a brutal manner whilst unable to lift a finger, I felt like I was going through the same emotions as Glass. Then comes the determination of humanity. Being left for dead the only thing that drives him on to seek vengeance is the love for his son. Dicaprio delivers an outstanding performance, Hardy nailed it too as the worst that humanity can offer. Cinematography is outstanding but it was the emotional story line that hooked me. It will rip your heart to shreds, more so if you are a single parent. The best movie I've seen.Can you bear it? Puns aside (and I can only guess that you at least heard about the infamous scene I'm referring to), this is a rather gruelling and very violent movie. It really is very visceral and you will see things that are commonly attached to either horror movies or violent action movies. But it is necessary to go all the way to show what characters have to endure and go through at certain points. So the viewer can really feel what is going on. No matter how hard it is to watch that is. And Leonardo Di Caprio did win an Oscar. Finally his fans will say. Though even they admit, it might not be his best movie or rather best performance in a movie. But that's not what counts. What counts is the journey and the fact he did deserve one overall speaking. It's a bleak movie and it won't be everyone's taste, but once you cope with what's happening you will have enough tension to hold you until the end of the movieI walked out of this after 30 minutes Just so stupid and obvious, full clich√©s.  I walked out after the bear attack and they asked if someone will stay behind to take care of him, and inevitably its the guy who been trying to kill him who decides to stay behind. Really, really!  Hey Hitler, do you mind taking in some Jewish refugees? sure, bring them in, all of them. And what happens? he takes a pot at killing him, but lo and behold, he survives somehow. Guy has a knife, a gun, killed 2 other perfectly healthy adults but can't kill a guy in a stretcher that can't move. How did this thing win any award is beyond me, a movie is about telling a good story, and this story this terrible, oh the acting is great, look at the camera work, who cares if you can't stomach the story!There's a Billion Revenge Films, and This is The Best One. The Revenant is one of my favorite movies of all time. It follows the story of Hugh Glass, a man who was betrayed by a man he trusted, and will stop at nothing to track him down. The plot is pretty simple, yes. But that doesn't mean the movie is bad. DiCaprio put his heart and soul into this movie. Despite saying almost nothing throughout the movie, you always know how he's feeling. His face always tells you everything you need to know. Not just any actor can do that. Tom Hardy also does a great job with his character. The movie is beautiful. It was filmed pretty much all on location, with only natural lighting. People complain about the amount of still shots and shots of nature, but I though it did a nice job of slowing the pace, showing where the character was, and showing you just how beautiful nature is. The whole movie builds up to the ending, and you will not be let down. When the movie ended, no one left the theater until the credits were over. My friend and I didn't even speak until we after the 45 minute ride home. We were too amazed with what we had just seen. Please, please, PLEASE go see this film. Get yourself a Blu Ray player and a nice big HD flat screen. What you see, is something you won't forget for a lifetime.An unmissable experience. If "The Revenant" doesn't contribute in some way to revitalising the Western genre, it is likely nothing ever will. The film is a remarkable experience; an example of what happens when each and all of the various aspects of film-making - original soundtrack; cinematography; second unit direction; imagery, etc. - fuse together as effectively as perhaps they are able to in order to deliver something quite extraordinary.  "The Revenant" unfolds in a place inherently dreary, yet somehow beautiful at the same time; takes place in a setting absolutely deadly, yet possesses a strange tranquillity to it. Mostly every scene or sequence is bookended by a magnificent composition of a mountain or a skyline of trees which you sense might succeed as an award winning photograph all by itself. It takes place in a world drenched in war; hurt; pain; loss and cynical opportunism (you can practically feel the grief dripping off the screen as to watch it), and while it is entirely its own film, somehow manages to draw on the best from other works of its sort (which range from "Into the Wild" and "Apocalypto" to Terrence Malick) in order to supplement the experience it's delivering to you.  Primarily, Alejandro I√±√°rritu's film is about the bourgeoning conflict between two men which then erupts into a tale of revenge as one goes after the other in the wake of a murder. One of these men is Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is guiding a troupe of (mostly) American fur-trappers to a fort through the barren winter wilderness of where the United States appears to meet Canada.  Glass, mistrusted by some of the crew as to having previously lived with the indigenous peoples of this terrain, and having previously apparently shot an allied soldier, is already grieving the death of his wife and the destruction of his village some years ago at the hands of the French Colonialists. His infant son, however, survived and now travels with him. The simplicity of Glass' exercise is complicated by an ambush they suffer by a group of Native American Indians: an event which forces the trappers downstream and deeper into the hostile wilderness from which they entrust Glass can guide them. Not interested in seventy year old stereotypes, I√±√°rritu bothers to cut back to the Indians who reveal themselves to be searching for the kidnapped daughter of the enraged chief and are therefore allowed an extra dimension. We actually want them to find her. "The Revenant" then completely changes gears when, inexplicably, it has its protagonist attacked by a grizzly bear to the extent that it very nearly kills him. What set out as a, and certainly would have been decades ago, somewhat standard adventure story of a lost group of people evading Indians and bandits (Mexicans; the French, etc.) through untamed North America ends up as something very different.  Space here is limited as to the extent I want to get across just how impressed with "The Revenant" I really was. What struck me the most was the way the film subverted the traditional action-movie character arc in BEGINNING with its lead in the worst possible state (bloodied and beaten) before only later becoming ready for the climactic 'showdown' when they are able-bodied.  It is in the aftermath of the bear attack that two volunteers remain behind to care for him, as the rest of the trappers press on to the fort. One of these is Tom Hardy's John Fitzgerald - a mumbling, grizzled Texan with money problems who has his own reasons for hating Indians. I√±√°rritu uses a combination of techniques to disguise the eventual conflict between the two men as mere small talk amidst a platoon of men just wanting to get back to base with their scalps intact.  When the first 'shot' of the film rings out, it is from Glass' rifle and the film cuts quite deliberately to Hardy's character reacting to it in the far distance - their binary natures are then established when it is revealed Fitzgerald only wants to save the 'pelt' skins they have accumulated on the expedition, while Glass tries to rescue as many fellow trappers as possible following the Indian raid.  Later, we witness verbal conflict on-board the escape-barge and then over Glass' son's ethnicity - were it not for the captain, who has authority over both of them and has already asserted it over Fitzgerald on the barge via an exchange in profile over whether to disembark, we sense they would resort to blows. The culmination of these exchanges spill over into the second act of the film and form Glass' ultimate goal, when Fitzgerald's hatred of Indians has combined with his superiority complex to lead him to do what he does. Watching Glass' recovery; escapade and catharsis is truly something to behold.  Perhaps the film's most impressive characteristic is its sheer nihilism: this is not a film wherein anybody really wins (except for, maybe, the Indians) Nobody's actions brings back their deceased loved ones; the world remains an incredibly savage, existential place full of death, pain, grief and natural selection - tomorrow, as today, a pack of wild dogs will savagely bring down a buffalo in order to eat him - time continues ticking, inevitably, towards whatever the future holds for us. Everyone (those few who survive) is largely worse off for what they experience in the film. Whatever you take from the film the most, there can be little denying that "The Revenant's" is a powerful accomplishment.The wool is over everyone's eyes There is a thing that happens every year when DiCaprio's movie that is good enough to get into Oscar contention releases. His fans are eagerly anticipating it to be more in the line of the departed(aka macho movie which celebrates masculinity) and not a j.edgar. Then the movie comes out which more or less gives them what they expect. Which is a well made movie that doesnt challenge the audience nor does it People often forget how accurate studios are with the release date they give a movie. They dont waste prime oscar release slots for oscar misfires..they allocate those slots for movies they think they can get behind and market/campaign to successful results atleast getting nominations. So you know if a studio like fox or paramount is heavily marketing a movie then at the very least it will get bunch of oscar nominations aka the movie is worthy enough for bunch of nominations. Then all the people inside hollywood or on the peripherals of hollywood who ever benefited from Dicaprio will root for him. In entertainment industry people are loyal to favors and not to actual talent. Its like living on a ship. You are loyal to whomever helps your stay on the ship and not the best person on the ship.Biggest currency in hollywood is doing favors. What I often thought that proved to be wrong this year is the size of the people that owe him favor is much larger than imagined. They are in every walk of showbiz campaigners,studio exes,producers,actresses,actors,directors,anchors,music artists who are his buddies at parties etc. Who do you think margot robbie will vote for when dicaprio is one of the nominees ? he practically launched her career ..all these mask what the movie really is. Which is , its a movie competently made by a director who wanted to take on a challenging subject and then an actor who helped get the checks to make the movie and everything about this movie is honest except the lead actor. Lead actor covers up his incompetence perfectly by trying so hard with over acting, by spending so much money to make the movie as authentically as possible and alas at then end a significant portion of audience who dont know anything about acting think of him as the greatest actor ever.Original and Magnificent Hands down this movie was done so well. From the acting to the picture, everything fit so well. I can't describe to you the appreciation I have towards the cinematography in this film and the effort it took to make the natural light fit. Alejandro did such an amazing job on the shots and the story was just so original. The life of these men was difficult and Alejandro portrays it so well. Definitely go see this movie and look above the entertainment aspect and appreciate it for everything. The CGI in this film was great as well but what really made me admire this film a lot was the lack of using CGI. The landscapes were all real from the mountains to the forest. You do not see that a lot in movies these days so it was amazing to see this was REAL life shooting. Just thinking how they filmed in parts of Canada and Argentina with a crew of 100+ is amazing. Great film, I hope to see Alejandro continue with this sort of taste to cinema.Wonderful pictures from the wild landscapes I heard from friends that this film would contain some brutal scenes. Then I thought I will be bored cause of the long running time. Well, there were so many adventure and wonderful pictures that kept all the time my attention. The best was the bear attack I have never seen before. Leonardo Di Caprio delivered again an outstanding performance for which finally he won the Oscar. Congratulations and thank you to all the staff for this masterpiece. 7/10.Brutal but great survival story Leo dicaprio certainly deserved the Oscar for best actor. The pain and desire feels increasingly real as the picture goes on, making it harder and harder to stop yourself cringing at some of the things Hugh glass does to stay alive. No one in today's industry could bring the raw emotion and determination to the role as dicaprio did. One shot toward the end of the film just has him staring into the camera, the pain and desire for survival dances in his eyes almost as if he had actually suffered from the events in the film. It is a knock out performance from Leo that makes the audience feel everything he feels. The number of one-shot sequences just blew me away, the cinematography of the famous bear mauling scene is just mesmerising despite it making you wince frequently. I didn't think Alejandro inaritu could top last years spellbinding movie "birdman", that also had some of the best cinematography I've ever seen, but here is a brutal, flawless, gripping western survival flick that ceases you by the balls from the first scene till the last.Downhill after the first twenty minutes This movie fails a basic test for me: is the ending better, or at least as good, as the beginning. The answer is a firm no. The first twenty minutes are really good, and the bear scene is painstaking and amazing. But after that it all muddles through. It's beautiful, yes, and I can see the filmmaker and scriptwriter trying to bring in action when it lulls. But the side plots (an abducted indigenous woman, the moral questions of side characters) are beside the point and never go anywhere. And like many films, the middle is about 45 minutes too long. When filmmakers and stars get enough power, they seem to reach a point where few people are willing to tell them to trim. The Revenant is case in point.A brutal and painful thrill ride from beginning to end The Revenant is a film based on true events. It tells the story about a fur trapper named Hugh Glass who is brutally mauled after a grizzly bear attack ,while he is on a journey with his team of fur trappers in America in the year 1823. After he is left for dead in the wilderness by his own crew, he is forced to survive and find his way back to Fort Kiowa alive, as well as seeking revenge on the man that left him in this situation.  First of all I have to say that this movie blew my mind the first time I watched it. This isn¬¥t just because of all the pain and suffering that Hugh Glass went through, but also because of the way the filmmakers handled the cinematography and use of camera in the wilderness. It made me actually feel like I was in those environments with the characters, because of how realistic it looks. Whenever someone are killed or die during this movie, it honestly looks like the actual actors are killed of for real. That's what I am talking about when I mean "realistic". This is all due to the use of natural light and real locations, and the fact that they never used any kind of studio light. Every single scene is filmed on a real location, and with only the natural lighting to help them shoot the sequences. There are a few special effects and some CGI in this film, but these aspects are only used when they really had to, like the bear for instance. Overall I can say that this is a really impressive made movie when talking about the visual imagery, and how the director Alejandro Gonzalez successfully managed to bring a true story into a long runtime film in such a realistic and intense way. The actors in this film deliver a fantastic performance on the screen in each of their roles, especially Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy that I think is absolutely Oscar worthy in this movie. The production design and use of costumes and practical effects, also helped this movie look pretty awesome, and this made me truly believe that these events were taking place in the wilderness in the 1800's. The movie is not perfect of course, because it got a few issues within the story and plot, and the way it is told to the audience can feel a little abrupt at times, because there are a couple of exposition scenes within the film that kind of slows down the pacing and the momentum that we got in the first act, and does not really add much weight to the plot at all. These sequences are beautifully shot and the actors does all a great job, but it is just that the scenes was not that kind of interesting and felt a little unnecessary for the rest of the movie in my opinion. This is absolutely a movie I would recommend you watching, no matter what kind of genres you are into. It couldn¬¥t have been more excruciating and brutal than this. This is filmmaking at it's best.Amazing movie This is not the first time that we saw Leo doing mind boggling stuff, he is a great actor, by far the greatest actor working currently I suppose, but this time he really took the things to the limits and a act for which he really deserve an Oscar. Love you LeoEmperor's new clothes time... Well, I have to say I don't really understand what all of the excitement was about for this very long movie that literally has about 5 minutes of a story line and ten to fifteen minutes of worthwhile scene watching. If anyone here says it would take longer than 5 minutes to give an incredibly in depth review of the story they are blessed with the gift of gab and exaggeration.  DiCaprio and The Bear are the only two good things about the movie. If they didn't get Leonardo to act this part I doubt that anyone would have rated the movie more than a 2 out of 10. The two points would have come from 1) The opening scene of a few minutes and 2) the bear scene. His great job make it a three... Save yourself over two hours of relatively useless movie, watch these two scenes and be impressed and happy. Otherwise it's on you to figure out why you gave up over two hours of your life that you will never get back.As long as you breathe, you fight. A group of American fur hunters who use Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) as their guide are attacked by Native Americans. A small group escape by boat, but they know they are being tracked. Unknown to the fur hunters the Native Americans are looking for the chief's daughter who was abducted. Glass devises a plan to throw off the trackers. Unfortunately he gets mauled by a grizzly in a very realistic scene of which the trailer only gives you a glimpse. Near death, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) a crusty untrustworthy man, is left behind to tend to Glass and give him a proper burial when he dies. Events happen that turns Fitzgerald into the film's antagonist as Glass pulls out all the stops to survive in the dead of winter and seek justice. This is not a lone man survivalist film as Glass meets people along the way. There is also a subplot involving Fitzgerald and his group that make it back to the fort. Very gritty film. Guide: F-bomb, brief rape, brief Leonardo DiCaprio butt nudity.Brilliant first 30 minutes, then go and grab a pizza somewhere... Spoilers! Lots of them! The first half hour or so of this is totally rivetting, especially on the big screen. The skirmish/battle scene is one of the best I've ever seen, genuinely terrifying, with the confusion and terror being perfectly rendered on the screen. And of course the bear attack, real edge of the seat stuff. The do yourself a favour and go home - you've had good value for you money, and if you stay you're about to waste two hours of your life. What's wrong? It's just silly basically. The ironically-named Mr Glass (he's indestructable, hence the irony) is so badly injured by the bear he can only move his eyes. Then he can just barely crawl through the woods. Then suddenly he's walking with the aid of a branch. Then he survives a near-freezing river experience without a sign of hypothermia. Then he's jumping on a horse's back. I can't do that and I'm really fit, no bear-mauling damage at all! Next he has a magic musket. Muskets fire one shot. Then they have to be reloaded. But Mr Glass has acquired the world's first self-loading musket, because it seems able to fire at will, without requiring powder, shot, etc. He rides of a cliff into the top of a tree then subsequently falls to the ground. No damage, obviously. Mr Indestructable! Then he climbs into the stomach of his dead horse to keep warm, the stomach I presume being around 6 feet or so in length. Gee that was a big horse! Finally arrives at the fort, almost immediately goes back out to find his arch enemy Tom Grumpy Hardy. With one person accompanying him. Why? Why not 20 men? Next he props his shot dead pal on a horse (as a decoy) by putting a branch down the chap's jacket. Why doesn't the dead man simply fall of sideways, or slump off forwards or backwards? No idea. It's magic! I really wanted to like this movie, I like Leonardo di Caprio and also Tom Hardy, and the cinematography is good. But this is just daft, silly, an insult to one's intelligence. It's not a fantasy film after all.Great direction and effects but nothing original here ... The original story about Glass as published in The Missouri Trapper ( http://hughglass.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1825-Hugh-Glass-article.pdf ) was far more interesting due to the bleakness of the real events. This movie would have been richer and more focused if it had dispensed with unnecessary embellishments and stayed closer to the true story. Instead we get a standard serving of tropes on a very pretty plate: Bad thing happens, abandoned person survives against odds to exact his revenge. The end. Oh, and the scenery is beautiful. Tom Hardy's bad guy character, Fitzgerald, never had the chance to be raised from a fairly 2-dimensional mumbling racist. The motivations of the Indian chief looking for his daughter was filler and you could cut out all scenes involving this group and the French trappers, and end up with a tighter film. There were some impressive effects used to create some very long takes - nice sophistication but if you are adding icing to the cake, at least make a nice cake. Almost every other DiCaprio film is better than this one. Watch this if you really don't have anything else to do for 2.5 hours.Worth ALL The Hype! A note to light-hearted movie goers: The Revenant is not for you. Life pits it's will on Hugh Glass, the real-life tracker &amp; fur trapper played excellently by Leonardo DiCaprio. And director Alejandro G. I√±√°rritu damn near tortures his cast &amp; audience in telling the story of Glass' revenge against the people, headed by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who done him wrong. Set in the untamed West of 1823, this is one brutal epic piece of film making. The visionary result is so relentlessly raw some of the actors referred to the filming as a living hell and watching the movie, you can feel their pain. The movie doesn't take long to get started and you can barely even get your bearings of what's going on before Glass and his expedition are attacked by Arikara Indians and as mayhem ensues, Glass strives to protect his half-Pawnee son, Hawk. But that is all tame in comparison for what is about to come. I am, of course, talking about the infamous fight scene where a mother grizzly (protecting her cubs) lays into Glass like a demon possessed. Make no mistake - this scene is as brutal as it comes and while you know that it's all "film trickery", it still doesn't stop you from believing it's real when you're actually watching it unfold. The whole movie, though, and not just that scene, is a visceral punch in the gut. You could gripe about the excess carnage and lack of philosophical substance, but surviving nature is I√±√°rritu's subject here, and he delivers with brilliance. And then there's DiCaprio. Hidden behind a grotty beard, his words are mostly reduced to grunts, but he nonetheless provides a portrait of a man in full. It's a virtuoso performance, thrilling in its brute force and is well deserving of his Oscar nomination &amp; win The Revenant is one of those movies that justifies it's hype, award nominations and wins. Definitely a must see film.Absolute trash People do not like this movie because it is good- they like it because other people tell them to like it. It is not a good film. It is one of the worst films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I spent two hours on a pile of trash- I was forced to watch it, really, I never wanted to- but I went ahead anyway, and I'm glad I watched it, because now I can warn you about it. Do not watch this movie. First of all, the movie is boring. But it's also too exciting at the same time. When I saw this film, I thought it had been made by a crazy person, because there was no plot as far as I could tell. All I saw was a neverending cavalcade of images- men running through the snow, getting bloodied up- shadows and lines and whispering, and big burly bearded pioneers. It was like the anti-violence therapy that Alex gets in A Clockwork Orange. I realized that this was a film that cared more about its visuals than its core message- it spent billions on renting and props and setting and cameras- but spent almost nothing on making the characters likable or having any lines. They could have made it a silent movie- nobody ever talks, except for a few seldom occasions. Some screaming, and a grizzled old pioneer tells a crazy story about a dead chipmunk or something- but that's it. The script mast have been three pages long.  I don't like Leonardo DiCaprio- I had never seen a film with him in it before this one- so I didn't need to be confused about which grizzled old pioneer he was. But I was so confused. All the bearded mountain men looked identical- I couldn't even tell the protagonist from the villain. I didn't even know there was a villain until the very end, when they meet up with each other. I did not know what was going on. All I saw was snow and men and blood. Everything about it was unclear.  It was disgusting- he falls off cliffs, gets eaten by a bear, swims in sub zero water, eats a stomach or something- this is a snuff film, not a historical drama. I do not want to watch a man come near death for two long hours. But even the most action packed scenes did not excite me- strangely, they bored me. I was bored by this movie. It's not a good movie. It was made by the same stupid idiot as Birdman- I should have guessed- and we can see, in the first scene, that it is made by the same idiot as Birdman. The first scene has a bunch of pioneers stumbling around, setting up camp- and it's all taken in ONE SHOT, and the perspective of the camera sways around the actors, zigzagging- and then they get attacked by some indians, and they run around, and the camera follows them, instead of just staying still- all just in ONE SHOT- and then we get some cuts, which are nice, because I hate that "one shot" business that the guy always gives us. He did it enough in Birdman- he didn't need to do it here. Also, they added Native Americans in- even though the guy in real life DIDN'T HAVE ANY INDIAN RELATIVES- in fact, the guy who made this movie was criticized for how historically inaccurate it was- how dramatized it was, all in the hopes of getting some more cash from gullible suckers- how much unnecessary violence there was in it- and how he just added some Indians in there to be politically correct. How sad. How sad. There do not need to be any Indians. Not racist, it's just that there shouldn't be any Indians if there WEREN'T any Indians. This film is absolute trash from the gutter. Do not watch it. It is a waste of money.A Visual Wonder This was a review I wrote back in early 2016 for a class project, so this was before Leo won his Oscar. The Revenant is the movie many say is finally going to get Leonardo DiCaprio his long deserved Best Actor Oscar. Inspired by true events and directed by Academy Award winner Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu (Birdman), this Action/Drama film has received Oscar nominations for acting, cinematography, editing and many more categories. But does it live up to all of the critical attention it's getting? The movie starts out with a panning shot of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) and his son Hawk (Forest Goodluck) in a flashback in which his deceased Indian wife is encouraging him to keep fighting onward. The film then cuts to a continuous shot of Glass and some of his regiment hunting for food for their camp in unsettled territory. While they are gone, a hostile clan of Indians attacks their camp, killing around 30 of Glass's men. The survivors retreat to the river and escape on their boat, only to abandon it in an attempt to mislead the pursuing warriors. Things take a turn for the worse when Glass gets mauled by a bear and is near death. John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) echoes the sentiments of many who believe they should leave Glass behind to increase their odds of survival. But when money is offered by one of the regiment commanders to stay with Glass until he is able to move, Fitzgerald volunteers along with Bridges (Will Poulter) and Hawk. Eventually Fitzgerald gets tired of baby sitting and tries to kill Glass, but ends up killing Hawk instead. He lies to Bridges about Indians approaching and they both leave Glass for dead. Abandoned, Glass (with the help of the voice of his dead wife) picks himself up, conquers the elements and gets back to his camp. The remainder of this epic film recounts his perilous tale of survival.  Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic, Inception) delivers one of the best performances of his career, playing Hugh Glass, a man whose wife was killed by soldiers during a raid. In a good eighty percent of the film Glass is mute due to a bear attack in which his vocal cords were damaged. Unable to speak, he communicates an incredible array of emotion through his facial expressions and actions. There's one scene when he is strapped to a plank of wood, still recovering from his wounds and Fitzgerald wants to kill him, but Hawk saves him. Fitzgerald then stabs Hawk and Glass is upset to the point of foaming at the mouth out of anger at Fitzgerald for killing his only son. In another scene Glass is cautiously approaching an Indian from his wife's tribe. When the Indian points his weapon at him, he immediately falls and successfully explains that he is injured and needs help using body language. DiCaprio has come a long way from the pretty boy he played in Titanic, and while this isn't my personal favorite Leonardo DiCaprio movie, his ability to convey complex emotions and communicate without dialogue definitely makes this performance Oscar worthy. I hope he finally gets it.  Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises, Mad Max: Fury Road) plays the antagonist in this movie, and is an extremely unlikable, selfish jerk throughout the film. He is constantly finding ways to take advantage of others for personal gain. He shows this best in one scene where he and Bridges are traveling back to the camp to get their reward for staying behind. Bridges asks Fitzgerald, at gunpoint, if he lied to him about leaving Glass because of incoming Indians and Fitzgerald says yes. Bridges isn't the bravest or the smartest of men, and is unaware that his gun isn't loaded. Fitzgerald, however, knows the gun is not loaded and wrestles it from Bridges. He points it at Bridges, telling him to stay quiet about the lie. In classic villain fashion, he says "the Lord giveth and taketh" and pulls the trigger. Bridges of course is OK, but has received the message loud and clear. At the end of the film Fitzgerald in his final act of cowardliness, tries to kill Glass to cover up his lies and treasonous acts. It was a hard fought battle but in the end, Fitzgerald bites the bullet, or in this case, the arrow. An excellent performance overall by this multi-talented actor who should be a contender for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu hired Emmanuel Lubeski for the cinematography, and it is some of the best I've ever seen. He makes some interesting choices like multiple continuous, one take shots. The best example is when DiCaprio gets attacked by the bear. The way they shot it in one take is absolutely outstanding. Just when you think they are going to cut away to another angle, they stay with the same shot throughout the entire scene, which makes it even more tense than it already is. Another technique Lubeski used a lot was close ups on the characters' faces. Probably the most intense part of the film, aside from the bear attack, is the final fight between Glass and Fitzgerald, which is mostly done in one take. The way they zoom in on the battle made me super tense from the expressions on their faces as they were dueling to the death. He also shows incredible scenery in many shots. We soak up mountains, sky, horizon, and forests thanks to Lubeski's glorious camera work. I would not be surprised if he won the Oscar for Best Cinematography; this guy know how to make scenes visually memorable.  The soundtrack was created by Alva Noto and Ry√ªichi Sakamoto, two names I have not seen before. They do a good job setting the scene by the use and lack of use of background music. In the beginning of the film when the Indians are invading Glass's camp, the music drowns out the battle sounds, setting up the somber mood of the lives being lost as Glass and his men retreat to their boat on the shore. Probably my favorite instance of where they don't have any music is the scene where the bear mauls Glass. The absence of the music make the scene extremely tense since were are forced to listen to the agonizing screams of Glass and the grunts of the bear without anything to soften or detract from those sounds. The music finally comes back in at the very end of the scene when Glass and the bear fall down the hill and the bear lands on him and both lay motionless. I will definitely keep my ears open next time I go see a film with these two as the film composers. Of course, movies are not perfect, and there are a few nitpicks that I have with the film. The first one is in the scene where Glass is still recovering from his bear attack and some hostile Indians find him near a stream. He gets away by swimming. He can hardly walk without collapsing, so how can he swim as fast as he did away from the Indians? The current helped a bit but there were sections of the river that were calm and the Indians were shooting him with arrows. One or two should of hit him. Another issue comes up after Glass rescues an Indian girl from a rapist and flees from the group the rapist is from. He then falls off a cliff into a tall tree while his horse falls all the way down and dies on impact. In the next shot Glass looks fine except for having a bit of difficulty walking. This makes little sense since he was critically injured earlier in the film and is still not one hundred percent back to full health. And finally, immediately after the fall, a snowstorm hits, and Glass cuts out the organs of his dead horse, goes inside for warmth (much like Luke in Star Wars Episode V) and survives the night inside the horse buck naked. I would think that would lead to a faster death by frostbite, but I'm no expert. It just left me confused and a little skeptical. These must have been the embellishments to the "inspired by actual events". There were some instances where an off-camera character's voice sounded a bit odd, like 2 of the same person was speaking at the same time, but that only happened a few times. Even the best of films can have a few small flaws.  Overall, The Revenant is one of the best movies of 2015, which says a lot coming from a year that produced films like Star Wars, Mad Max and Inside Out. The acting is great, the chemistry between the actors is believable, the cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen, and the music makes the scenes memorable. It definitely deserves a least a few awards, one for the cinematography and one for Leonardo DiCaprio for pulling off an excellent performance of a character that had to be very difficult to portray. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of DiCaprio, great camera work and intense survival films.A ghost film about a revenant, a double miss Let's say it, this film is one of the Oscar-flop of 2016. Beautiful object, by an excellent filmmaker, but for once has planted. The Academy (and others) did not see anything. The immediate impression is very positive. The photography is spectacular, costumes, makeup perfect (it's like) and the physical commitment of all the actors is impressive. The rhythm is slow, the plans are long and fluid. The story ... that's where it gets stuck. This film is gold wrapping that wraps a bronze medal (it could have been chocolate) I think Father I√±√°rritu got lost in his technical performance and the intensity of the context of his shooting. After the very successful Birdman, who already put in play a technical challenge (very long shots) but was touching and fascinating by his scenario, his characters and this subtle game between the theatrical form and cinematograph, here he adds a technical layer but forget about everything else. Because for the form, it is difficult to do better. Mainly thanks to the shooting locations and the magic of the weather phenomena. Magic that made several team members left the shoot because of the difficult conditions. Here too we are dealing with long, very smooth shots, but because there is a but, this process is not ideal in all situations. And not all the time. The specificity of cinema is the succession of different points of view. The transition from one plane to another is an alchemy that creates our emotional involvement. A little like the chemistry that makes it possible to obtain a 3rd ingredient from the two completely different 1sts, the assembly makes it possible to create a sensation which is born from this succession of different images. Here this process involves us in what is happening on the screen (being a witness continuously of everything that happens) but curiously I found that it prevented me at the same time from entering the heart Of the history. I floated around the characters and in these snow-covered forests but I was not there. I think that's where the technical process became its own justification and no longer a way of telling the story. Each day of shooting, the whole team repeated (blocking) these very complicated plans and at the end of the day, they had about 1 h 30 to turn the shots or plans. That's probably what made the filming so hard and long. A system to be able to say that one kept his line, that one preserved an artistic integrity. Unfortunately, when a method becomes its own raison d'√™tre, it condemns the purpose of the company: tell a story, make us live emotions. There are several moments when wow have it in his head, but the heart is not there. Because the story is very linear and does not carry major issues. For short, it comes down to: argument, left for dead, survival, revenge, end. During each of these stages, few moral questions are raised. There are some, but they remain confined to the facts presented. We leave the wounded man to his fate: but he is still alive, yes, but the Indians are coming. That kind. For a good part of the movie, DiCaprio struggles like hell. This kind of experience forces the one who lives it to make profound changes, such as during a pilgrimage. Here (almost) nothing. The character advances, survives, fights but nothing lets feel that he really lives the situation. Probably because the process (yet): paste a wide-angle lens on the nose of the actors imposes a way of seeing things that does not necessarily stick with what we tell. The system becomes its own disadvantage and kills what has spawned it. We are very far from Seul au Monde, with Tom Hanks, where we feel transformed over the course of his adventure. I was infinitely more excited when I saw The Gray with Liam Neeson. Same context, the Indians in less, the soul and more, The physical commitment of the actor is admirable but that's not what makes you vibrate. There are indeed some effects of style (appearances of his wife and son - adoptive) but which are only dreams, visions. They show us what he lost. Painful detail that must be taken into account before seeing this film: its masochism. The number of sufferings through which the protagonist goes is such that it made me think of Mel Gibson's Passion. 2 hours of whipping. Here it is a little that, more varied. Such a martyr is almost survivalist pornography. All this for what? A story of revenge. History of fat and cruel colonists. I√±√°rritu has offered us some sumptuous films like 21 Grams or Babel. But here, the shell is empty, because I do not see what can be removed. Even the best filmmakers can crash. I√±√°rritu often talks about the ego in his interviews. And in general, it is people who have trouble getting rid of it who talk about it the most. I think he got himself here. This film has the form of a work of art but does not have the substance. Its shape is reminiscent of Terrence Malick's films except that it is sorely lacking in sensitivity. Malick (in The Tree of Life for example) shows a succession of moments of life, without necessarily linking them by a dramatic plot, but everything digs in us and throughout the film, we are brought into this state that makes the films so wonderful sometimes. Here we live viscerally events (which is already not bad) but nothing "hollow". We could make a musical analogy: this film is a bit like the last albums of the Dream Theater group. Formerly the spearhead of progressive hard-rock inventive, sensitive and technically very high level. Today they play their own farce, flowing in an infinite complexity but without soul. In view of the beauty of the film's photography, the intensity of the actors' play (should they overplay for that to be seen behind their hair and their disheveled beard? Or is it to compensate for the emptiness of the characters?) and its slow form, it is easy to believe in a great movie. I√±√°rritu probably believes it. To believe is not to be. In any case, I did not find what makes me go sit in a dark room. I bet in a little while, nobody will talk about this movie anymore. Only time reveals what's true and what's not.Amazing in every regard except for story. Its a shame that in a movie with such exceptional directing, acting, cinematography, music, and production design that the story couldn't have been amazing as well. That's not to say that the story here is necessarily bad it just feels a little thin especially for a 2 1/2 hour film.  There are definitely elements of a compelling story here, especially when it comes to the internal and external conflicts of the two main characters, Hugh Glass and John Fitzgerald (played marvelously by Leonardo DiCaprio in a career best performance and Tom Hardy) Hardy in particular is the most fleshed out and interesting character and has several monologues that let you get to know him as a person and its pretty riveting. The movie clearly is not trying to be story driven, instead its more focused on imagery and themes and does both very well. In fact basically everything about this movie is spectacular hence the high rating, but if it had a better story this could easily be a 10/10 and one of the greatest films ever made. Still worth a watch at least once, especially if your interested in making films yourself someday because their is plenty of mastery here both behind and in front of the camera.  To talk a little more in detail about the acting its superb all around. I'm not always the biggest fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, in fact I think he has given many overrated/underwhelming performances, but he knocks it out of the park here with a subtle and nuanced performance. DiCaprio shows a ton of emotion here despite not having very many lines which is not something I would have thought was in his ability's but I was proven wrong here.  Tom Hardy is exceptional as the main antagonist of the film. He does a good job making his character not feel evil necessarily, but like an ordinary man who's trying to survive and painfully unfeeling towards his fellow man due to his past. Its Hardy's best work since Bronson.  Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson are also both totally believable in supporting roles as well.allot of reapect for the actors working in such weather conditions I really loved the movie! very real especial effects. Leonardo dicaprio gives his all in this movie. Only there is a cliff he falls off at one point with horse was to much! But with my experiences in life everything can happenin life also falling extra of a cliff with horse you know and i am not being sarcastic in any way! Rest of movie great acting great performance also great acting from Tom hardy and the capiten.Very good film, but not quite great 'The Revenant' (noun: "a person who has returned, supposedly from the dead") is a film about a man left for dead, Glass (DiCaprio), and his lust for revenge keeping him alive in the wilderness. Set in the 1820s, in what was then the Wild West of Montana (but filmed mostly in Alberta, Canada), Captain Henry (Gleeson) and his men, including Glass, his son Hawk (Goodluck), Fitzgerald (Hardy) and Bridger (Poulter) are collecting pelts (I assume deer?) when attacked by Native Americans, setting them on a desperate journey back to 'civilisation'. Obviously, plenty goes wrong, including Glass being attacked by a Grizzly Bear, which even though it's CGI, is an amazing/horrifying thing to watch! He survives, but is left for dead and thus begins his improbable survival tale for vengeance. There was a few things I didn't like that much, including the score (too piercing at times), the length (over two &amp; a half hours, and it meanders for about 40min in the middle) and some of the repetitiveness (always seem to be sitting around a fire!) and unnecessary flash-backs/visions. However, the cinematography is absolutely superb - hopefully more films are made in Canada after this! - and Leo is solid, with his shaggy hair and crazed stare on display. Hardy is great and completely unrecognisable as Mad Max, while Poulter provides the film's conscience. For mine, it's a better film than 'Birdman', but although it strives for it, it's still not an exceptional film. The ending leaves you, like Glass, exhausted and questioning everything.Movie theaters were built for experiences like this Some people will complain about the visual extravagance or the simple emotional notes here...but you gotta be dead not to enjoy this film. Inarritu just followed Birdman (all the words) with The Revenant (no words needed). Enough said. And as if the directing effort was not sufficient/staggering enough, he got two true stars at their absolute pinnacles. This could have been a simple survival and revenge tale, but the visual flair and acting take it to another level. This is what movie theaters are for.Great fim, poor script A great example of how fantastic performances, scenery, cinematography, and possibly direction can be ruined by a script that ends up formulaic, unbelievable, and reliant only on the most base of human emotions. I suspect heavy interference from above on this one.worth watching I originally thought a role such of this was out of DiCaprio's range. I was quite mistaken. He played the part very well, and to my uninformed eye, quite realistically. I felt quite involved with his struggle and liked the insight into the Indians interaction with the various invaders. The movie was interesting, and involving. It definitely deserves the M15+ rating but the violence didn't detract from the story line. It's worth watching, you truly feel involved with this interesting story.This is must watch movie. From the first frame, you know you're here for something special and that's pretty clear. Leonardo has given his everything to this film. Exceptionally beautiful direction and screenplay. Superb cinematography. Poignant soundtrack. specially soundtrack is best of the best. Must watch movie.Don't even bother watching this! When the film initially launched I was stoked, I couldn't wait to see it, however, I was terribly disappointed. If you are into films with the lead character only having a handful of lines, whereas the rest is one big grunt. This might be the perfect film for you. My advice is if you have plenty of time and wants to waste more than 2 hours of your life, feel free to. The only reason Leo received an Oscar for this performance must be, because the committee felt terrible for not awarding him one earlier.Always Too Many Leo Pin Worms Leo is a decent actor and has hardly ever been great. The cinematography and/or wilderness was a huge bonus as it adds a vast mystery to this story. He did alright in this one. The movies he's been in may have been Good, but his acting no so much. Although, he was pretty good in...that wallstreet movie and D'Jango Unchained but that's it. I think (I can't at the moment think of others). As to detail to Revenant, it is boring and tedious, never really developing anything but Leos character' retribution or revenge. The bear scene was good but not movie-making magic, as another review says. While I appreciate the ordeal the real man had to endure, the movie simply lacked character.A Rare Experience It is one of the most beaten clich√©s of movie-marketing to call in the viewer to experience something unusual. When in truth there are very few filmmakers who are able to pull off something like a sensory cinematic experience.  Alejandro Gonzalez I√±√°rritu is one of those rare directors. His movies defy narrative conventions ("21 Grams", "Babel") and also visual templates ("Birdman"). Now he has achieved his next big step. A big budget adventure story that is reduced to its most minimal plot-elements while being a truly immersive experience that manages to give a tangible sense of a long-gone era. Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a tracker who assists a band of fur-trappers in the early nineteenth century. He is attacked by a bear along the frontier of Montana. And after being left for dead finds himself amidst an unforgivable wilderness.  The screenplay written by Mark L. Smith and I√±√°rritu is a starting point for a film that relies first and foremost on the image and is therefore reconnecting with the era of silent film and the most fundamental roots of the medium. I√±√°rritu who tried to avoid as much as possible the trappings of computer effects has production designer Jack Fisk, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, costume designer Jacqueline West and his actors pull out all the stops. You are left with images, sounds, faces and languages that force you to reflect on your life two hundred years after the events shown here. Leonardo DiCaprio manages, not unlike Tom Hanks in "Cast Away", to hold the screen with his presence in a performance that is mostly wordless. From teen-heartthrob to superstar to character actor; DiCaprio's trajectory seems to be about choosing his projects according to the challenges they face. And it must be said that his devotion to the portrayal of an archaic character whose prime motivation is survival is as simple and riveting as can be. Before he began shooting "Birdman" I√±√°rritu sent his cast an image of Philipp Petit, the high-wire artist who walked between the towers of the World Trade Center. It was a symbolic gesture of what he and his collaborators were trying to attempt with their movie. "The Revenant" represents another high-wire act by this Mexican iconoclast. It is a successful attempt to resurrect not only a forgotten time, but also some often neglected qualities of cinema. May it jolt all those timid formula-makers out of their slumber.Dicaprio is back from the dead! There's been a long dry spell since Dicaprio starred in a decent thriller, this film has ended that dry spell. If you can enjoy a movie without IMAX, giant screens &amp; surround sound- then you have found a quality film. I didn't even need to step foot in a theatre, I've enjoyed this movie with about 480p- and still stunning imagery.  I'm amazed by the views and scenery. It gives you a sense of what Dicaprio's character is going through. I won't go into any plot... This movie brought back memories from Christopher Noland's films applaud Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu and Emmanuel Lubezki for their work in this movie, I look forward to more like this.A harsh, brutal and engaging depiction of one man's willpower The trailer for Revenant is very misleading. It would have you believe this film is full of fighting scenes, battles and generally action. It's not. It's mostly about one man's struggle against nature. Overcoming his weakness and injuries in his drive for revenge and survival. The majority of the film is slow-paced and focused on the incredible willpower of the protagonist.  Seeing this film on the big screen can be overwhelming. The brutal, realistic scenes, close-up shots of actors' faces, perfectly showing the struggle and pain they experience, and the incredibly harsh environment, make for one of the most memorable cinematic experiences this year. As can be expected from DiCaprio and Hardy, the acting is phenomenal. One can almost feel the pain, the cold, the hunger and the fear they experience. The camera captures all this perfectly, as well as showing beautiful scenery and biting winter weather, all filmed using only natural light.  The plot, despite being quite simple, keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats, rooting for the hero's survival and admiring every time he manages to get up and keep going.  The one criticism would be about the realism of all the misfortune, that befalls DiCaprio's character. There are points where it is really too much for one man to endure and the opinion of the antagonist, that "there is no way he could survive that" seems quite correct.  Another thing to note: this is not a film for the squeamish. The graphic, bloody scenes involving both humans and animals do not hold back in realism.Hollywood drivel Only in Hollywood could they take the life of Hugh Glass - a man whose story needs no embellishment to rate as "astonishing" - and subvert it to the point of disgrace. Using the rough outline of the Glass arc, this movie adds absurd and, more vitally, totally unnecessary plot lines about sex slave Indian daughters and martyred, fictional sons and all manner of other rote plot devices in order to - I guess? - try and dramatize a story about a guy who *literally* crawled 200 miles without skin on his back in order to save his own life. As if Hugh needed the posthumous help. Hardy might win an Oscar for his excellent performance as foil and I'm sure Leo will get plenty of hype for grunting his way through 150 minutes. But man, they're both just shadows cast behind a movie that could have been great. The writers could have fictionalized a plot loosely based on Glass's life and rightly called it fiction. Or they could have made a great movie about what actually happened and sold it as truth. Instead, they manage go wrong in both directions. "The Revenant" dishonors Hugh Glass, disrespects its audience, and desecrates a tale worth being told much better than this. Your time would be better spent sleeping inside a dead horse.Wow! A great movie to finish the year with. So when is DiCaprio going to win an Oscar already? This guy puts his heart and soul into every movie and he sure knows how to pick them. This is a movie that has a lot of heart and was terrific from start to finish. Tom Hardy also was terrific in this one. From the start I was riveted. If I didn't know this story was true I don't know how vested I would be in this, but knowing this story really happened it made the movie incredible. The camera work was brilliant and the CGI was tremendous in a great bear scene that will be talked about going forward. Don't miss this one if you can help it. This is about a man who overcomes adversity over and over again. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because 20 minutes could have been trimmed, but that about it. It is a must watch so get your popcorn and be amazed at the how this man lived in the 1830's and what he went through in a compelling story with great actors.Remarkable work by Leonardo DiCaprio,The Oscar Deserves Him Leonardo DiCaprio Himself Said The Revenant his 'most difficult film' But After Watchig This Movie I Asked Myself "Is There anything this guy can't do"? Great film has the power to convey the unimaginable. We sit in the comfort of a darkened theater or our living room and watch protagonists suffer through physical and emotional pain that most of us can't really comprehend. Too often, these endurance tests feel manipulative or, even worse, false. We're smart enough to "see the strings" being pulled, and the actor and set never fades away into the character and condition. What's remarkable about Alejandro Gonzalez I√±√°rritu's "The Revenant" is how effectively it transports us to another time and place, while always maintaining its worth as a piece of visual art. You don't just watch "The Revenant," you experience it. You walk out of it exhausted, impressed with the overall quality of the filmmaking and a little more grateful for the creature comforts of your life. So My Review 10/10 An extraordinary piece of work by Leo,director and rest of the cast,Must Watch GuysA true story, made original Really, what a wonderful experience. I was daunted by the film's duration. But after the first scene, I was applauding the DOP for his innovation and relationship with his subjects. At the very least, this film should be recognized by its' effective use of optic technology. Wow It was like II was there - a true advancement in the craft. A hard call between Leo De Caprio and Tom Hardy for Best Actor or Supporting role. You know from the first scene who to root for and who to despise. But something golden has to come of this triumph. I've honestly never experienced such an up-close-and personal sideline view of a series of events. Thank you for that. I was fortunate to have grown up close to where this film was shot. The locations are where I leaned how to camp, fish, ski, trek and teach my son to skate on a mountain lake with snow swept clear by the wind so you can see the fish 30 feet down. I would have given this movie a 10, but for a couple inaccuracies which I will not dwell on. Please enjoy his film and pass it on to friends. Ground-breaking cinematography, a truly compelling story and a truly committed effort by the actors. (I've been in that water and I'll tell you, Hell is cold).visceral experience from beginning to end The Revenant is definitely one of the best shot films of the year. Some of the camera moves are just extraordinary. The story is simple, but that's fine because it's the overall experience that's unique, not the premise. It's basically a revenge western meets a survival story. Set in frosty Montana, Hugh Glass must overcome all odds to avenge the death of his son. All the acting is great- but it's the mood that really stands out. From icy mountains, to great plains, the oppressive and gloomy atmosphere will not be for everyone. It's a hard film to sit through. There are scenes of great violence and very very slow-paced scenes. Plus the runtime is over two and half hours. So it might not be for everyone- but it's still an excellent film.Miserable; Not Only The Character's Life But The Film Too At 156 minutes, "The Revenant" is unwatchable, so it wasn't. After an hour, instead skipped to watch a minute every three or four through to the last twenty minutes which encapsulates the final conflict between John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Hugh Glass). Nothing was missed for in between is Glass grimacing left then right. There is a harrowing, savage bear attack leading to Glass hanging to life by a slender thread. Oddly, all that came to mind is how the effects were accomplished. That goes to a lack of empathy for protagonist Glass. This is a film of unquestioned artistic merit. Though some gush about the cinematography, it is merely serviceable. It's not the cinematography that's beautiful, it's the wilderness. All that's required of an available light cinematographer is to set the frame and F-stop. The actors most likely kissed pavement back in civilization after shooting this demanding film. They did well under the circumstances, particularly DiCaprio. The villain is the director and the unreachable allegory he wrote on the script pages. In "Jodorowsky's Dune," the titular director made a few memorable Seventies' films. When pitching "Dune," the studios requested a standard length film - 120 minutes (not viable for a film from a story this complex). But Jodorowsky wondered why it couldn't be ten hours or twenty hours. He was clueless why the studios weren't funding him. The doc is in part the story of a delusional, out-of-control ego. The viewer may wish to slap his face. Enter Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu who also appears to have an ego of the same dimensions. God bless the artists, but not those who trade their expression for self aggrandizement. Not only is "The Revenant" a vanity project, it is Oscar bait. Awards should be given to those brave enough to sit through this slog. It is a simple story raised to the power of crashing bore. "The Revenant" is nearly incomprehensible, and filled with spiritual mumbo-jumbo even I√±√°rritu most likely can't explain. See this if you relish masochism. It's a bet this film will bomb. Maybe that will awaken I√±√°rritu. He's a genius. He just doesn't know how to connect with an audience. He certainly doesn't here.Great Movie Leonardo DiCaprio deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie. His part in this movie was very, very well played out, he made you feel that he was actually suffering from the pain that he received. Watching Leonardo go through things he did made you feel lucky that we don't need to live the way they did back then and fear that any moment, your life could end. Tom Hardy's role was also played well, watching his role, he made you feel that you need to jump through the screen to help Leonardo to seek his revenge. I will not say much, but I could watch this movie again. I know that this movie will be one of the best movies that will be out in 2016. This is a very must watch film. I will also give much of the credit to the Director for making this feel real.If this doesn't get Leonardo DiCaprio his Oscar, nothing will. I had the opportunity to watch The Revenant at an early press screening yesterday, and what an exceptional movie this is! You are on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film, Lubezki's cinematography is out of this world and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is absolutely riveting and Oscar-worthy. The naturalistic beauty of 17th century America that is visualized in this movie is beyond anything I've ever experienced in film. Hugh Glasses' story is a legendary one, and they couldn't have honored his legacy any better than this. Alejandro I√±√°rritu has outdone himself once again.Man in the Wilderness RIPOFF The movie is nothing more than a Hollywood ripoff. See "Man in the Wilderness". (1971). Starring Richard Harris and John Huston. This includes the bear attack and left for dead. An Absolute RIPOFF. Sorry this is a joke just like Leo for doing such a sham! The same can be said of Will Smith's I am Legend. A Hollywood Ripoff of the Omega Man. (1971). Starring Charlton Heston Anthony Zerbe. Right down to the zombies and his blood cure. When will Hollywood get through their heads that just changing the title and actors doesn't make this a different film. This is a ripoff of a classic film. Leo should be embarrassed!Best direction by Alejandro and great movie This movie was really good Leonardo DiCaprio did a really good acting it was really like a real scene was going on instead of a movie. It had some flaws like how could he survive bear attack and after that how can he survive the fall from the cliff but still it was a very good movie the direction was really amazing i mean like Alejandro did a great job every scar , every death , every place was captured in a really amazing manner .The story is very simple DiCaprio has his son killed by Tom Hardy and is left in a very bad shape and he recovers and takes his revenge but how he takes his revenge and his recovery (really i mean his recovery was very tragic) is just captured in a amazing way .This is a must watch ,this movie is a bit slow but it is worth it just go and see it.The closest visualization of the trip to hell and back I've ever seen in a movie The man on that very trip is Hugh Glass. This first paragraph is to give everyone a heads up as to what they should expect going in to this movie. For starters don't be expecting a action film, this is far from an action film. There are many down moments and many periods of time with little dialogue, if you are easily bored beware. Now on to the review of the movie. The first and foremost thing I will talk about is the cinematography. I swear to you that this film houses some of the best camera work I have seen in a movie, not to mention the difficulty of shooting in natural light on top of the tricky and great shots that they pulled off. The first battle scene between the Arikara and the fur trappers was filled with many great shots, not just long shots but very maneuverable shots. If this film doesn't take the Oscar home for best cinematography I would be very surprised. Hats off to Emmanuel Lubezki for he truly is a master of his craft and is on the top of his game in this one. It truly is a shame however that the score is unable to enter into the Oscar race, the way it pairs with the visuals work quite well. When it comes to the more intense scenes a very heart jolting percussive tune joins with it, in the smaller more beautiful moments of scenery are accompanied with a more orchestral type music. The music works quite well and I wished it could of at least of gotten a Oscar nod. Although I have stated this film isn't a action film it does have some very very well executed action sequences, the first encounter between the Arikara and the fur trappers was great. If you have scene the trailers you already know what I'm talking about. Another one would be when Hugh is running from the Arikara on a horse, and if you have seen the 50 second clip you know what I'm talking about. That is something that bothers me though is how they pack the trailer full of action and get viewers expecting something different that what is actually given, on top of that baiting a demographic that would most likely be disappointed. If you want to see the movie for the action you have the trailer and the clip which gives you almost all the action that is in the film. This film is about the journey Hugh Glass goes through and it portrays it without any sugar coating and in the end pays off quite well. The performances are very good as well. Tom Hardy and Leonardo Dicaprio are practical shove ins for nominations, I don't however think either one will win but would be pleasantly surprised if either one won. In conclusion the film is ultimately good but isn't for the action hungry, it is very technically well made and practically a guaranteed win for cinematography. The film wasn't as entertaining as I was hoping it would be and it may overstay its welcome a little long but the film quality doesn't disappoint, I would rate it an 8.5/10, thanks for reading my review and I hope you can enjoy the film.A brutal, harrowing, and visually stunning adventure film unlike anything that's been seen before The Revenant is Alejandro I√±√†rritu's majestic revenge story set in the early 1800s that follows the larger than life true story of Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he travels across old America in hopes of exacting revenge against the men that left him gravely wounded and his son dead. The revenge story line is the oldest in the book and, no matter how overplayed, evokes the most emotion especially when the players are right. DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Will Poulter make for some pretty excellent players in I√±√†rritu's more visual film and this allows audience members to connect with the film on a more accessible level rather than the cinephiles that this film was made for. Emanuel Lebezki has, yet again, outdone himself. The beauty in each frame is undeniable. The landscapes, the snow, the blood, the violence. No matter how harrowing a situation is, the film is still one of the most beautiful ever made and this is a testament to Lebezki and I√±√†rritu. The patience they endured on set speaks volumes to the film that they made. The Revenant isn't fast paced, it isn't action packed, it is a story told through the eyes of a visionary and that may off put some people who are looking for a film like The Hunted or The Grey or any other man against wilderness film. The film is slow and takes it's time in giving the audience something they can sink their teeth into. Instead, they allow the audience to be submersed in this cold and desolate landscape, all while capturing the beauty of the American landscape. The battle scenes are epic. Mostly done through extended long takes, the film is a cinephile's dream. The camera movements, the tracking shots and that glorious bear attack are all beautifully done and shown in the most harrowing way possible. For a film to open with an over 10 minute long take of a battle nonetheless, it is truly captivating and awe inspiring to see filmmakers push themselves to their limits both physically and creatively. But as much as the filmmakers pushed themselves, so did the cast. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a brilliant performance as Hugh Glass. In films before, we've seen DiCaprio fake pain. In this film, you actually feel his pain. With every bite from a bear, every broken bone being reset, every wound being crudely stitched, his performance reeks of perfection and that is exactly what we get from him here. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald is a typical bad guy here, nothing more nothing less. He's good, he's not on the level of DiCaprio here though. The rest of the cast is amazing, as always with any I√±√†rritu film. Overall, The Revenant is a brilliant film that isn't quite a masterpiece but has enough technical achievements within it to set it apart from any other film this year. I definitely recommend it.Hollywood meets Native Americans Yet another over the top movie with too many graphic effects and no substance. At the end of the movie, I just sat there wondering what the whole point of the movie was, because if I wanted to see raw violence, I would just go on the Ogrish website and watch the be-headings and other atrocities from ISIS. Perhaps it is this continuing pointless display of violence that causes the manifestation of all the violence in this world. For me, the movie went wrong as soon as the bear attack happened. Of course, only in Hollywood would it be possible to create an epic fight between a bear, four to five times the size of the pro/antagonist, yet with the bear still loosing the battle. What gives, though; as long as there is an epic CGI battle with blood splattering all over the screen, then the movie must be good. Truly disappointed in yet another Hollywood garbage movie that is meant to excite the Zombies here in America.Good start, but someone got arrogant, which made the movie absurd... I was lucky enough to watch this movie early and saw it without the knowledge that it was from the same director as Gravity and Birdman. The movie was good until the horse jumped off the cliff and into the tree. Looking at the end result of that stunt the director completely lost me as viewer. All the gravity the heavy story had; became an absurdity, which is an incredible shame. That single scene should have been edited out, which would have saved the story, because everything what happened afterwards became an irritating show-off of special effects (like The Hobbit trilogy) and no longer the gritty film what it was. The special effects are indeed amazing and you are very often left wondering how they have pulled that off; especially the bear scene. However, special effects shouldn't dominate the movie and the story should always come first! At the final scene it suddenly struck me that this was a movie from Alejandro Gonzalez Innarito, because it was such a signature of his. It is too bad he got too cocky here, because Gravity and Birdman were both beautiful masterpieces. The Revenant in its current form is definitely not a masterpiece unfortunately. Less would have most certainly been more in this case and I can only hope they revise this movie before release, trimming some unnecessary scenes out...Standard Hollywood script format, and what real story? The upsides to revenant --Lots of gritty action --Decent special effects --Good acting --Good cinematography --Good costumes --Downside, the entire script is based on knowing an audience's attention span is 15 minutes, make the story mesh for 15 minutes, and then you can start over from scratch, as long as you keep them engrossed in the action --The Pawnee, a Midwest tribe in Nebraska, ending up in the mountain ranges of British Columbia is ridiculous.  --The French traders are making a living trading fur with the Indians, but they kidnap a Pawnee Indian girl from one of the tribes they trade with and serial rape her, and kill a stray Pawnee Indian they come across (the french can verbally communicate with the Pawnee) and hang a sign on his body written in french (the Pawnee speak french), the whole thing was done to create an additional antagonist, Hollywood style. The reality is, people (even evil French), would never jeopardize their business and lives in this fashion.  --Our protagonist gets cold and manages to generate a fire with a flint and black powder, all well and good. THEN our protagonist is caught up in a river that is below freezing, he goes over waterfalls, through raging rapids, finds a tree piece to cling to and after several more minutes lands safely on land. The life expectancy for someone with a ravaged sickly body in such water is under 15 minutes. Our hero climbs onto shore, the camera pans somewhere else, and comes back to out hero with a blazing fire. EVEN if the guy still had some black powder (which he doesn't, he left it behind), it would never be able to start a fire with wet powder. --Our hero comes upon the French and sorta saves the Pawnee Indian girl (in British Columbia), and takes a good ole black powder pistol, maybe its a flintlock, maybe. In any event, he takes the pistol, and some how manages to get off 3-4 shots with that one shot pistol, taking down Bad guys while riding a horse. Then later he gets set upon by a pack of Indians, and gets off a few more shots, taking out Indians while riding horse back, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the SEMI AUTOMATIC black powder pistol(Glass was bear mauled in the 1820s, so it was a semi automatic cap and ball pistol folks). --Now we come to the climax. The bad guy runs off with the company money and two guys go after him. This is WITH the knowledge that the guy has taken everyone's pay, is heavily armed and the country side is crawling with misplaced enraged Pawnee tribes. TWO guys go out to get the baddee. Not likely, in reality the fort would have sent as many people as it could spare. I'm not going to bother to elaborate about the real facts of the Glass bear attack; that there was no revenge factor after Glass was mauled by a bear. He had no children. That he was in fact mauled during summer. That the colleagues of Glass killed the she bear and nursed Glass back to health, somewhere in the sunny midwest (not BC in the winter).  Finally, the movie does not say at the end that no animals were brought to harm, I know they used puppets and special effects in some cases for the animals, but if in fact animals were not brought to harm in the making of this movie, it WOULD say so in the credits.  -IE, animals were killed in the making of this movieWonderfully Crafted The Revenant is one of the most beautifully shot movies I have ever seen. The opening scene alone will make you wonder how the hell they did this. There are so many creative shots with sweeping camera angles and beautiful vistas. For that alone I'd recommend seeing it. As the story goes, its based on true event. The real story of Hugh Glass is an incredible story about the will to survive and the need for revenge. The Revenant portrays that very well. At times it's brutal, savage, and unforgiving, like what frontier life was probably like in the early 19th century. The acting is all well done, from Dicaprio as the lead to Hardy as the villain; they were all convincing. The only knock I have about this movie is the pacing and length. I knew going in being familiar with the story that there were going to be slow parts, a wounded man clinging to life and traveling through the wilderness was bound to have slow parts. Visually alone, I think most cinemaphiles will have a lot to like about this movie as well for people who are interested in the the time period. This film is certainly well made and the fact that they used only natural lighting adds to the already impressive production values.+Technical Mastery, -Synthetic Spirituality = Memorable Mediocrity My popcorn tin was heavier when I binned it than when I collected it. Why did I throw up when watching The Revenant? There isn't that much gore to speak of.. What's worth a loud unflattering speech is the wooden spoon of pseudo-philosophical pretensions AG I√±√°rritu gags the audience with for 2 hours and 26 minutes. I sat with that warm tin on my lap even through the 10 minute credits, contemplating. Consider that Glass' chief motivation for returning from the grave (gravely wounded really) is his love for his Pawnee son, with whom the only memorable scene shared is patting him down from an outburst against Fitzgerald's (Hardy) ferociously racist taunts. He only becomes that much close to him after Fitzgerald coats his rusty knife with the teenager's gastric juice, in a powerfully screamed-out scene. Consider how much running time we spend watching Glass wander wistfully into the afterlife, despite knowing full well he'll overcome his bear wounds for a showdown or the film wouldn't be funded. He eavesdrops on whispers by his murdered wife's wraith, only to wake up and cauterize his torn-open neck with gunpowder; I√±√°rritu wants to both have his bison liver and eat it. How much can you cheat the narrative?  Most redundant of its sophistry is the Darwinian symbolism, as Glass evolves from being bruised and buried, to a crawling creature, to a one-legged limper, to a biped man to a horseback riding gunfighter... In Alfonso Cuar√≥n's Gravity, evolutionary symbolism at the end served a purpose of literalizing how survival is a prerequisite for evolution; we wouldn't be writing reviews on IMDb if Neanderthals hadn't scrambled Mousterian tools 300,000 years ago. Here, Glass gets wounded and persists only to become the same man again.... not even a wiser fellow. Above everything, the over-ballyhooed bear attack is dampeningly underwhelming. Not-to-spoil anything, but you remember it, how you give a cat a bowl of milk, the bowl gets swirled around a bit with only a few licks of milk spilling over the edges.. Yeah. Oh, it's not even all in one long continuous take as it's been touted to be, there's a very visible cut soon after Glass arms himself with a knife. What it isn't is even 1/10th as visceral as the jaguar-mauling from Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. What it is is ten times more pointlessly protracted and thusly expensive. On the other hand, The Revenant is filmed with such hypnotic beauty. Lubezki's camera floats around inordinately, (pans more than it tracks) and he seems to find heavenly imagery in every 360¬∞ plane. Nature has never looked better in a Hollywood production. There's a grim fairytale (&amp; Ron Fricke-esque) edge to the proceedings. The wide-screen frames are filled with towering forestry, snowmelt and dew drops dripping off the damp lushly colored leaves in close-up. Negatively charged oxygen reaches for your lungs off the screen. When the film slackens to luxuriate in wonder, never is it boring; it's only catching its breath. The editing is often fabulous. From flame-to-flame match cuts in the snow, and most memorably, Glass' labored breath fogs the lens, dissolves into clouds floating in the mountain ranges which are then viciously consumed by Fitzgerald's pipe smoke. But Ho! there... characters' lives are risked for this virtuosity. There's a scene in which Jim Bridger, the story's most conflicted entity, when finding their way to camp with Fitzgerald, happens upon a massacred Native village, huts still smoking. Him and us, (but not Fitzgerald) see a surviving lady, for whom Bridger leaves a parcel whose contents neither we nor her know to be; she's seen Fitzgerald stomp around and cuss, she's surmised his inclination towards violence. She has to choose between 1) staying safely alive by hiding a little longer, or 2) bowing to the logistical limitation of I√±√°rritu needing to pan around, show her to the audience discovering bread in the parcel and pinching off mouthfuls, then urgently cut to the next scene. Does she play it safe? Not if The Revenant is going to strike a balance between manipulative and masterful. Still, despite the objectionable, emetic and offensively on-the-nose endeavour, I√±√°rritu deserves an Oscar again, if only for the scene in which Glass eviscerates a dead horse he's ridden off a cliff, and the camera smoothly sails around from the horse's back as its viscera are scooped out, travels in a long take, timed to the action, to find Glass snuggling into its steaming 'womb' then conclude with a close-up of his face. Wow!! (No matter how many takes and fired crew members it took) The most human performance is by Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald, consistently flawed and gleaming with gallows humor. Don't be surprised if during the final snowy showdown, you're rooting for him to cut down pretentious. DiCaprio, well, he..... works the hardest. You know that clip they play at the Oscars, your most electrifying moment during a performance, DiCaprio's here is effectively a grisly series of those. My two favorite are him trying-to-not-blink to save his life, and him crawling out of a shallow snow grave, and mortared between his teeth, equal parts spit and grit. Despite my reservations, I'll cheer a lung out for either clip. You can almost hear the voices in his head (his Birdman?) yell in Calvin Candie rhetoric; "Eddie Redmayne, that new kid, he gimped hisself out last yur, won that Oscar for it.. What are you gonna do, Huh!?!" Such a troubled production, he ate real raw bison liver, yet still he required 5 stunt doubles and 3 photo doubles... that there is a metaphor for the whole movie. While the film is never boring, calling it entertaining would be flattering it. No exhilaration derives from watching a man ride a horse off a cliff; the experience is very akin to staring into an open wound, waiting patiently for it to a cicatrize into a scar. 7/10.If this doesn't get Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar win, I don't know what will. The terms "immersive" and "visceral" are often loosely used, but THE REVENANT has taken strong ownership of them, and all it takes is director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's sharp and creative directing and maestro cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's distinctive camera style and seamless edits that take us through the landscape, up close and personal. THE REVENANT is one of those films that will be talked about for generations to come, whether it be at a film school among students and experts or at a coffee shop among aficionados who've just seen one of the most incredible films ever. The character Hugh Glass is a legend when it comes to the history of the frontier, these are the times before the things we often associate with wild wild west. Writer/director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and co-scribe Mark L. Smith take source from Michael Punke's novel but they put a fictional twist of their own on this actual historical character, played in the film by the great Leonardo DiCaprio. In this film, Hugh Glass has a mixed race son because he was once had native-American wife, Glass and his son join fur-trapping business that got attacked by the natives, one of the people in their expedition is John Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy. One day, Glass gets mauled by a bear and left for dead by his team members. Fitzgerald is one of the three staying behind to care for Glass and to give him a proper burial should he passes. But Fitzgerald kills Glass' son and takes off instead, an event which then motivates Glass to survive in his relentless pursuit of revenge. Whether it be interior like "Birdman" or outdoors like "The Revenant," Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a director who's committed to taking the audience to fully experience because he understands the wide range and the scale and he also fully understands the stories of these characters and he smartly conveys them to you. Yes, it's a primal existential survival story, yes it's also a revenge and redemption story, yes it's also father and son story, but the way Alejandro films it, the way he tells it, makes THE REVENANT more nuanced than that. And just like how this film manages to transport you to a land and time that's rarely tackled in cinema, it also successfully transports visual spectacle to a new height that's never before seen nor felt. The sequence in which Leonardo DiCaprio's Hugh Glass gets mauled by a bear, for example, it's as if you could feel Glass and the bear's breath. This is also why Lubezki is one of the greatest of all-time because his cinematography aims to make you feel like you're present there, you see the angles, the edges of the screen, everything about it is very welcoming, very inclusive. This is Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance yet, one of the things that makes him a great actor is that he's clever in his rhythmical movement and facial expressions, he's on point, he knows how to make a scene more emotional or more intense, this is an actor who gives his all for his characters, and you see that dedication once again in THE REVENANT, working in toughest most uncomfortable conditions, he even strips down naked, Leo's devotion to this character, Hugh Glass, is admirable. Tom Hardy also gives an equally outstanding performance as the villain, Fitzgerald, who's only looking out for number one, what matters to Fitzgerald are himself and his ambitions, he doesn't have a problem with kicking integrity or honor to the curb if need be. And so when Hugh Glass ultimately gets in the way, it's kill or be killed mode for Fitzgerald and Hardy, with his sturdy intimidating stature, accomplishes that. THE REVENANT is a beautifully shot film, much of it will remind you of the works of writer/director Terrence Malick, whom Emmanuel Lubezki collaborated with several times including "The New World." There's something majestic, something grand about THE REVENANT and at the same time, there's also something inspiring and hopeful about it. THE REVENANT is a work of art, a masterpiece.Would be great without any actors at all - just scenery The stars of the movie is the scenery and the cinematography (even though I'd never want to go to any of those sites). It was beautiful in a way 'Dr Zhivago' was but the Russian epic had other things going for it too. The story was 'Tarantiono does Grisley Adams'. The violent opening scene is an echo of the starting scenes to 'Saving Private Ryan' - shocking violence, retelling what were once portrayed as bloodless. While this was an action movie it was no thriller. Knowing the running time and that some of the main characters had to die, was my guide but I wasn't invested in the outcome. The end came as a welcome relief and if they are editing for a shorter version - less DiCaprio would be my preference. The bears were beautiful and almost too believable with every hair distinguishable. I confess, I was rooting for the bear! Right was certainly on her side. Tom Hardy has had a hell of a few years from 'Loche', 'Peaky Blinders' and 'Legend'. He was easy to watch because his character clearly didn't give a '*&amp;%$'. D Gleeson was almost unrecognizable in 'Star Wars Ep VII' and is the new hope for gingers everywhere. Some people think the movie will have trouble making back the budget because the handsome stars keep their clothes on but in fairness, depressing doesn't sell. Look at 'The Road'! I say - imagine it without the woeful drama and just enjoy the majesty on the big screen For those of us who don't lead a charmed life like DiCaprio, we don't need to pay ¬Ä6 -10 for another 3 hours of it. That's why Christmas is so popular - its an invitation to be happy.Is this Leo's Oscar home-run? With the Revenant you will join a group of world class actors and the rising stars on a cold, wet and bloody journey through natural lighted mountains, forest and swamps. (small 1st plot point spoilers possible) It's a simple story of a 'Dances of the Wolves' like man who lived among the "savages" and is showing the arrogant whites a save passage through enemy territory. It's a story of a man who's lost everything but his son, which he had with a beautiful Indian woman. A clearly ambitious Patrokles-like son, who is forced to keep his mouth shut in order to survive the hate of the whites. When the man loses his son, the problems begins - plot-wise. Since he's lost his only emotional connection, we don't get very much to know his character in later scenes anymore. And a death of a loved one might shock us for a moment, but as the character and as with every film and it's duration, we carry on. What can you offer me next? Unfortunately even the beautifully conceived wide angle mood shots can't pick up the slack. All acquaintances are short. It clearly overkills the dark, noirish conception of the character. Now I have no clue about the original source of material but a reinterpretation of it would have been good - something like a companion, or even an animal. Think of Dances with the Wolves and how the death of the wolve grabbed our emotional attention, after we've learned how the friendship was build. Another appropriate example might be Nicholas Wending Refn's Valhalla Rising. There again we have a buddy-movie like plot device - the boy, with whom the nameless fighter can connect and defend, which makes him at least more of a three dimensional, human killing machine. The revenant is plot driven, which is such a missed opportunity, because we actually are interested and care for the main character, but are left unsatisfied, and I mean not in a cliffhanger way of unsatisfied.  Mr. I√±√°rritu co-wrote the script with Mark L. Smith. Now I'm sure that there is a clear set of symbolism which might illustrate certain inner thoughts etc., but this should'nt have been conceived as an art housian film. It should have been written with clear cinematic language, with iconic symbols, with more emotion, rather than too much of the ultra realistic gore. Yes, animals died for this movie and it's absolutely justified in order to depict the survival in nature. Take it or leave it, but your chicken did not die of stroking. I picture a lot of fun and work in the production design process, but as so often today, the script wasn't ready yet and no one cared, because great actors signed in already. The script heavily relied on Hemingway's iceberg principle. Show the tip of the iceberg, the rest is imagination. Well, in this case the polished mood pictures just weren't sufficient for me. Seeing all the twitter reviews about the bad pacing only proofs my point. As film lovers we all know that film is never about the real-time, it's about emotional-time. Scarface is a near 3 hour epic but for us it feels like a short drug intoxication. Why? Because we don't feel the grass growing, but rather a light-speed trip to mars.  To close with a Oscar prediction: Sorry Leo, it ain't work this time. You gave a marvellous performance. You swallowed so much dirt, only Christian Bale can beat you with that. But your character lacked the emotional dept an audience needs that in order to be behind you. No Sir, it was not your preparation, not your dramatic art. Through the setting you were forced to suffer, but any actor in this role would have, so what was there to stand out? Unfortunately the soucre material did not allow you to go in for more.brilliant, just brilliant Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu's masterpiece. a tour de force, if I've ever seen one. from the amazing opening shot, this movie immediately hooks you. the movie is a brutal depiction of man against the wild. a survivalist story that can sometimes be difficult to watch or even stomach, as some of the scenes can be quite gruesome. the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are spectacular. Leonardo, who doesn't speak much threw out the movie, depicts Hugh Glass's pain and suffering with the skill of a true thespian grand master. Tom Hardy is chameleon. he is able to lose himself in a character in such a way that unless you know it's him acting the part, most people would never know it was him. all in all this was a great story. just prepare to lose yourself for about two and half hours. I assure you, it will be well worth the time.The Wonderful Visuals Bring the Film to Life The Revenant (2015)  *** 1/2 (out of 4)  Visually striking drama/action film about guide Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) who crosses a grizzly bear and is seriously wounded. Before long the man (Tom Hardy) left back to protect him leaves him to do as well as taking away someone very close to Glass, which leads to a tale of revenge. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has quickly become one of the greatest directors in regards to visuals and it pretty much happened over his last two movies including this. As with last year's BIRDMAN, this film here takes the director's visual style to a whole new level and it helps create a rather unique and original looking film that takes on a subject that has been told before but it works. I say this type of story has been done before and it has countless times. With that said, more than likely the majority of people watching this film hasn't seen the story before because we really haven't seen this type of Western in several decades. I think it's fair to call this a Western but it's rather hard to imagine the Indian massacre, the bear battle or the intense ending not making this a Western in its own way. The strongest thing about this film are the visuals but we've also got a couple excellent performances from DiCaprio and Hardy. Both men are wonderful in their roles and this is especially true for Hardy who is just so cold blooded and evil that you can't help but want to see him in a lot of pain. The actor does a marvelous job building up this character without too many words but when he does say something it rings right through you. As for DiCaprio, I'm not going to lie but he's one of my favorite actors and he has been since I first saw him in THIS BOY'S LIFE back when it was released. I don't think this is one of his greatest performances but he is still wonderful here and especially since he has to do the majority of the acting with his eyes. The film's settings are another major plus as you really do feel and believe what you're seeing on the screen. The director does an excellent job at making you feel everything that the lead character feels and this includes the now already legendary bear attack. The film's brutal violence is another major plus because it just makes everything seem a lot more realistic. THE REVENANT is certainly one of the most beautiful looking movies you'll see from 2015 and it has two great actors delivering excellent performances.Survival A favorite era of mine for film stories has always been the mountain man era in the American west. No white people in great numbers, just single shot weapons, they were the ones outnumbered so survival against the Indians was far more an even struggle than in the post Civil War west. The Revenant by dint of its many nominations has laid claim to being the greatest film about that era ever made. It goes up against such items as Across The Wide Missouri, The Big Sky, and Mountain Men, Jeremiah Johnson all pretty good films. It would have been hard to deny Leonardo DiCaprio a Best Actor Oscar this time around. He's on screen for most of the time and with minimal dialog DiCaprio has to use facial expressions and body language to convey his emotions. He does it well and should share his Oscar with the cameraman who did all those closeups of him. The plot is best compared to another mountain man picture A Man Called Horse that starred Richard Harris. DiCaprio who was guide to the expedition of fur trappers is badly mauled by a grizzly bear and is after being toted for quite a distance is abandoned by Tom Hardy who claims he died. DiCaprio just wants to settle the score. Unlike Richard Harris he does not find a friendly tribe of Indians to take him in. His survival is his personal story. The Revenant also won the Cinematography Oscar for the shooting of the rugged winter country these men are in. It's so good the landscape, cold and forbidding, becomes almost a character in the film. Like The Old Man And The Sea was for Spencer Tracy The Revenant is a personal film for Leonardo DiCaprio. Unlike Tracy who had that magnificent speaking voice for the narration, no narration here. Just anguished expressions convey what DiCaprio is feeling. Leo got his Oscar and it was a deserved one for The Revenant. It's a great film, but very brutal at times.Absolutely brilliant, one of I√±√°rritu's and Di Caprio's best 'The Revenant' to me is one of 2015's best films and deserved its hype, its critical acclaim justified. It is easy to understand why the audience reaction is more divided, but to me the low ratings are too harsh. The visuals, direction and acting are so brilliant that even if the film didn't impress me it still would have gotten no lower than a 4 or 5. Its best assets are the visuals and direction. Simply put, 'The Revenant' is one of the best-looking films of the year and a thing of sheer beauty. The settings are rich in atmosphere and the lighting remarkably natural, but it's the cinematography that shines brightest, it's both intimate and immersive. I√±√°rritu's direction is even better than in his outstanding direction in 'Birdman', some of the best direction of the year. Acting is marvellous, everybody showing great commitment. Leonardo Di Caprio got his only Oscar for his performance here and it was more than well deserved in one of his best films and performances, a performance of emotional intensity and honesty that is most agonisingly poignant. Tom Hardy excels in bringing brooding menace to his role, and Will Poulter is impressive too. 'The Revenant' has much more to it than those things. The action is brutally tense and the story, while deliberately paced and very simple, immerses the viewer in how gripping it is, being intense and emotional. The characters are strongly realised. Film fares least in the script which is not bad at all but occasionally a little garbled. This is such a minor criticism however and not enough to bring down my rating. In conclusion, brilliant film. 10/10 Bethany Coxbeautifully shot Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a frontiers guide with his half-Indian son Hawk. Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) had sent out a hunting party for fur pelts led by Glass. The group is attacked by Arikara party led by Elk Dog searching for his daughter Powaqa who was kidnapped by two white men. The survivors retreat to their boat. Elk Dog gives chase thinking Powaqa is held prisoner by Glasses' group. Glass decides to lead the men over land despite disagreement from John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). Glass is attacked by a bear leaving him half-dead. The men refuse to follow Fitz and leave him behind. I√±√°rritu's visual style is impeccable. Tom Hardy's acting is great. DiCaprio wins a lifetime Oscar award. This thing starts out like a roaring train culminating in the bear attack. It does get a little messy after that. While Tom Hardy is great, the movie should follow solely DiCaprio after the bear attack. It also has a convenient encounter with Powaqa. This should be simpler and end with a simple mano a mano fight. I do love the trick that Glass plays on Fitz.Handsomely made, compelling in its brutality, but narratively a bit too simple It is good to be wary around this time of year because with the Oscars and many other awards imminent, there is a tendency for studios to release 'worthy' films ‚Äì many of them are really good too, but a lot of them are 'worthy'. It is hard to say which one The Revenant is, but it does certainly seem like a film where everyone went through a lot of physical hardship. I don't read around films much, so I'm guess on that, but the on-location shoot and freezing conditions seem too tangible for them not to have made the shoot a long and challenging one. If so then it paid off because this aspect of the film is by far the strongest element ‚Äì the brutality, the fight for survival, and the contrast of these tiny people against the vastness of the landscape. As such it is the technical delivery which is really the star. It is a consistently impressive and handsome film - whether it is the CGI bear of the opening 30 minutes, or cinematography which manages to have both nimble movement in/around the action as well as taking in the sweeping vistas as it reproduces the cold onto the screen. This aspect of the film carries it a long way, because for the most part this is a dialogue-free affair as Glass pulls himself from death to try and get revenge on another character. As a journey it is a tough slog and unfortunately it partly becomes that for the viewer too, because the film does have a slow pace and is essentially a slow crawl to its target. It does enough with the atmosphere to ensure the viewer is in the mindset where this works well, but it is not the type of film that one would throw on for a relaxing Friday night in. It is an odd feeling, but for me the time did not drag, and I was help by its single minded and consistent brutality, but at the same time it was not a story I felt gripped by in the detail of the character ‚Äì more the overall experience. The story does have the constant theme of parents and children. Of course this is the motivation for the revenge plot, but it is also behind the group of Native Americans who are also integral in the film; and of course the bear attack itself is a parent acting in defense of its cubs. This element is interesting but it doesn't always work. In the main plot it feels just like a plot device (which it is) and the floaty other-worldly connection to the dead wife doesn't chance that. The other father, hunting his daughter, doesn't bring a great deal to the film in terms of emotional content and, being honest, the only parent/child relationship that I really felt for was the bear cubs left behind by the death of their mother (I know, typical liberal watching people die but getting teary over the animals). The cast match the sense of brutality, and they wear it well in their characters. DiCaprio of course gets the headlines, but others are just as strong and one could argue that Tom Hardy really gets the best of the film as he gets all the good lines, has the most tangible character, and where the film has standout scenes, he is mostly in them. The technical delivery is the overall star though, because it is a film that is handsome, very well made, and has a lot to like in the look, atmosphere and sound work throughout. In this way it is more than worth a look, and it is compelling in what it does, even if at the same time it is not as strong in the characters and their stories as it is in the creation of this atmospheric struggle to survive.One of the finest survival films in recent history After winning 3 major Oscars last year, it did not take writer and director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu to come up with his next work that garners major awards attention. Recently, he won Best Drama Movie and Best Director at the Golden Globes for "The Revenant". Also it looks like this is finally the movie that gives Leonardo DiCaprio his first Academy Award. It is a pretty long film, runs for over 150 minutes and takes place in snowy America. The first parts of the film show us a group of fur traders. When the central character is attacked by a bear, they decide to leave him back and the film is basically split into two different parts: Glass' fight for survival and what the other gang members are doing at the same time. These include Tom Hardy's character, the main antagonist. I found him interesting to watch too. It becomes obvious how he is not only ruthless and greedy, but also how he is somewhat of an outsider in the group with the other people mostly admiring Glass for his perseverance. Also the scene when the young guy threatens him with his gun is pretty memorable. After Fitzgerald realizes the gun won't fire and it was never his intention to kill him, he lets him live too. A multi-layered character. Not just pure evil. Lets take a look at DiCaprio now. It is basically a 100% physical performance, almost non-verbal. He speaks only very few words in this film, occasionally in Indian. His scene with the bear mauling him is certainly among the most memorable of the cinema year 2015. Very tough to watch, yet it's equally difficult to look away. His scenes with his Indian pal or the Native American references in this film could have been better in my opinion and did not really make an emotional impact on me. Nonetheless, the people behind this film succeeded with the really difficult task of making a film this long that does not (or almost never) drag at all. It is also one of these films that you should really watch on the big screen if you have the opportunity. The cold, bare, mean snowy landscapes make this very atmospheric. Will Emmanuel Lubezki win a third Oscar in a row for his work here? It certainly seems a possibility right now. Even if I would not rank this movie among the very best of 2015 for me, it was still a thrilling watch for the most part and DiCaprio's performance alone makes it worth the watch. Also always nice to see Domhnall Gleeson such a good guy like he does in here. I like him as an actor. Back to Leo, the last shot on his face was truly memorable when we see him look right at the camera. Very very haunting. Go check it out.Original, Fascinating, Brutal and Realistic with another Great Performance of Leonardo DiCaprio In the Eighteenth Century, in Louisiana, a group of fur hunters under the command of Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) is attacked by Arikara Indians and the few survivors escape by boat through the Mississippi. The experienced hunter Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), who knows the area since he was married with an Indian and lived with her in her tribe, feels that the Arikara are following the boat and tells that it is better off hiding the fur and walk along one week to their fort through the mountains. However Glass stumbles with a grizzly bear and is severely wounded before killing it. He is carried in a stretcher and the hunter John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) suggests killing him since he is near-death, but Henry offers an amount to the man that stays with him. Glass's Indian son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and the teenager Bridger (Will Poulter) offer to stay and Fitzgerald, attracted by the award, also volunteers to stay. However he tries to kill Glass and stabs to death Hawk. When Bridger that was fishing returns, Fitzgerald lures him telling that twenty Arikara are coming and he does not know where Hawk is, forcing Bridger to leave Glass behind. Now Glass begins his dangerous journey of returning alone to the fort seeking revenge against Fitzgerald.  "The Revenant" is an original, fascinating, brutal and realistic film with another great performance of Leonardo DiCaprio. Supported by wonderful landscapes and the music score of Ruiji Sakamoto, the viewer does not feel the 156 minutes running time in a perfect pace balancing drama and adventure. The scene of the struggle between Glass and the grizzly bear is impressively real and mesmerizing. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Regresso" ("The Return")Will Leo Finally Win? A frontiersman (Leonardo DiCaprio) on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team. The story of Hugh Glass has gone through a number of revisions in the last two hundred years. There is first of all the true story, which could never be known -- Glass himself likely embellished or mis-remembered certain details. We then have various biographies, a novel, and an earlier film "Man in the Wilderness" (1971). Surprisingly, the latter has never had a home video release. This seems like the optimal time to cash in. But that is neither here nor there. In this latest version, Glass has a son, which increases the emotional factor. Is it historically accurate? No. But we should not allow the facts to get in the way of a good story. With the Academy Award nominations out, "The Revenant" has become the film to beat in a variety of categories. With twelve nominations, it is certain to win a few. And the big buzz is that this is the year that Leonardo DiCaprio will take home his first statuette. DiCaprio has been in the acting game for about thirty years and has had countless memorable roles. Some are more serious than others, but he has always done a fine job, even if the films did not call for such professionalism. And as Hugh Glass, this is no doubt the finest performance of his career. Through much of the film, he is left unable to speak and his acting must come out non-verbally, which is considerably more challenging. But winning the award is not supposed to be about an individual actor's best role, but about the best role of the year. Even by those standards, the odds look good. Eddie Redmayne and Bryan Cranston are formidable, and Michael Fassbender is a potential winner (even if he looks nothing like Steve Jobs). But did anyone throw themselves in a role as deep as DiCaprio? Probably not. Tom Hardy, who plays the antagonist, is up for a supporting actor award. By all means, he deserves it. His devilish Fitzgerald is every bit as good as DiCaprio's Glass, and in some ways even more fun to watch. He is a morally reprehensible monster. But the competition in this category is a bit steeper because of a very unlikely opponent: Sylvester Stallone. Few people would consider Stallone a great actor, but he is getting many accolades for "Creed". He also has another factor on his side: the subjectivity of Oscar voting. The voters will often vote less on the individual roles and sometimes on an actor's career, especially later in their life. This could be Stallone's chance at a lifetime achievement Oscar. So, hardy deserves to win, but he is not guaranteed by any means. There are a handful of nominations in makeup, costume and production which could get a win. One of the strongest aspects of the film, though, is Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography. This is a tough category, because you have the incredible Roger Deakins and a bold 70mm look on "Hateful Eight". But Lubezki is right now the man to beat. He has eight nominations to his credit, and has won the last two years (for "Gravity" and "Birdman"). And, frankly, this might be his best work yet. There are some long fight scenes that are reminiscent of Seamus McGarvey's work in "Atonement" (2007). Could Lubezki win three years in a row? Could be. All that praise aside, there is one category that the nomination was quite wrong: Best Visual Effects. The film has a notorious bear-mauling scene. And while the effects are quite good, there is never any doubt that the bear is a computer simulation. A very nice one, but still fake just the same. And that may take the audience out of the movie a bit, as this otherwise excellent look at the wilderness has a very modern image of a bear transposed in it... This award may end up going to "Star Wars" regardless, as it tends to be the category for awarding movies otherwise not considered Oscar-worthy. In short: is this DiCaprio's best role? Yes. Also possibly Tom Hardy's best role. And some excellent cinematography. Movie of the year? Perhaps, or perhaps not.Mostly Gut Wrenching but Also, a Bit Simplistic I just finished reading a series of commentaries by people giving this movie a single star. Take your hatred elsewhere. If you didn't like the film, fine, but because it got hype, it's not your job to lower its rating; it's your obligation to say something intelligent about the filmmaking. This is one of the most visually striking features I've ever seen. The camera angles and the framing of the scenes is spectacular. During the first scene ambush, we get to see what it must be like to suddenly be in the middle of a maelstrom. Arrows are frequently seen as sterile in most films. Here, we get a taste of them being a kid of artillery. LIke "Deliverence," which is another unsettling film, these guys are just in the wrong place. Whether those furs were worth a lot or not, all their work wasn't worth it. Yet, from what we hear, they are people who are the dregs of society and need something to keep them going. Yes, when DeCaprio shows up, we began to see men who, despite their oaths, will look after their own butts. Honor only goes so far in this universe. The story of Hugh Glass is part of history. I, like many others, question the extent to which this guy is pushed to the limits (a lot of Hollywood gimmickry). It takes some real skill to deal with real historical figures. I doubt that a third of this happened. I do know that Hugh Glass was mauled by a bear and that he literally crawled across three states to get revenge. Had he been totally fictional, we would be much more forgiving. In this case, less would have been more, with some compactness and restraint. I will leave it to the experts to get at the technical stuff. This is a highly entertaining film. Anyone that gives it one star is just being spiteful. I suppose they don't like DeCaprio. One even criticized the fact that it took place in the early 1800's.The Revenant The definition is "revenant": 1) a person who returns, 2) a person who returns as a spirit after death; ghost, I was excited about this film months before its release, even more when it received award nominations and wins, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu (Amores Perros, Babel, Biutiful, Birdman). Based on a true story, set in 1823, in the unsettled wilderness of the Louisiana Purchase, quasi-military hunting party of trappers and hunters, commanded by Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), are hunting for pelts. The hunting party are ambushed by hostile Native American Arikara Indians, only half of the party escape on one of their rafts, they salvage as much as they can while still under fire from the attacking Arikara, Henry knows they will still be pursued. The party are further slowed down when experienced hunter Hugh Glass (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Leonardo DiCaprio) becomes separated from the others, he stumbles on a mother grizzly bear and her cubs, the enraged grizzly savagely attacks him, Glass eventually kills the bear, but he is left severely injured and nearly dead himself. The hunting party can only provide rudimentary medical care, they take wounded Glass with them, but he is on a makeshift stretcher, slowing them down, finally one of the party, John Fitzgerald (Oscar nominated Tom Hardy), suggests killing Glass. Initially Henry tries to kill Glass himself, but is unable to do so, instead he offers payment for several men to stay behind with Glass, only Glass' son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and young Jim Bridger (Son of Rambow's Will Poulter) volunteer, Henry ups the reward when Fitzgerald mentions the likelihood of the boys and Glass being killed, Fitzgerald volunteers also. Fitzgerald promises Henry to stay with Glass until he dies and give him a proper burial, but once separated from the hunting party Fitzgerald tries to kill Glass, who cannot speak while wounded, by smothering him, Hawk stumbles on this, and Fitzgerald kills him while Glass watches in agony, Bridger returns and Fitzgerald claims he does not know where Hawk is, and makes up seeing Indians, though Bridger is hesitant he agrees with Fitzgerald to leave Glass behind, leaving behind a canteen with a carved spiral on it. Glass, put in a shallow grave covered in earth, finds strength, though struggling to recover, to crawl away, walking through the woods and surviving feeding on roots, the same Arikara who attacked earlier are tracking him, the chief is looking for his kidnapped daughter, Glass narrowly avoids a confrontation at the river by floating down the rapids. Meanwhile Henry and the surviving hunting party have reached their nearly dilapidated barracks outpost, Fitzgerald and Bridger make their way to the outpost, Bridger realises Fitzgerald was lying to leave Glass behind, Fitzgerald intimidates him into keeping silent, and when they reach the outpost Fitzgerald tells Henry that Glass died and Hawk disappeared, Henry gives him his reward, Bridger refuses his payment. Glass encounters Hikuc (Arthur RedCloud), a friendly Native American, who like him seeks revenge, the Pawnee builds Glass a shelter during a blizzard, and the next morning Glass finds his friend hanged, he was murdered by French pelt hunters camped nearby, he rescues an Indian girl being raped, this is in fact the kidnapped daughter of the chief, he takes the Pawnee's horse that the French hunters stole, he accidentally leaves behind the canteen with the spiral carving. Glass encounters the Arikara, but escapes falling off a cliff, killing the horse and wounding himself further, Glass keeps himself warm during the night in the hollowed horse corpse, while back at the outpost a lone hunter is found carrying the canteen, a search party is organised, Fitzgerald realises Glass must still be alive, so he empties the outpost safe and flees. Henry's group eventually find Glass and bring him back to the outpost, furious Henry fails in finding Fitzgerald in a search, Glass assures Henry that Bridger was lied to, and is released from imprisonment for treason, Henry intends to bring back Fitzgerald dead or alive, Glass insists on coming with him. Henry and Glass split up to approach Fitzgerald from separate angles, but Fitzgerald ambushes and kills Henry, Glass finds him deceased, but sets up a trap to trick Fitzgerald, he gets shot in the shoulder, Glass chases him to the river bank where they fight. Glass stops himself killing Fitzgerald, remembering words from the Pawnee, so he instead pushes heavily wounded Fitzgerald downstream, into the hands of the approaching Arikara, the chief, with his daughter returned, kills Fitzgerald and spares Glass, in the end Glass has completed his revenge, but his flashing visions of his dead wife and son will remain. Also starring Paul Anderson as Anderson, Kristoffer Joner as Murphy, Joshua Burge as Stubby Bill, Lukas Haas as Jones, Brendan Fletcher as Fryman and Duane Howard as Elk Dog. DiCaprio as the shaggy frontiersman gives a superb award winning performance as the real man struggling through savagery and harsh conditions, Hardy is also fantastic as the menacing villain who leaves him for dead, the supporting stars are good too. This true story set in the wilderness of 1820s America, about revenge, redemption and survival is astonishing, watching the man alone fighting to stay alive, and punish those who betrayed him, with fantastic cinematography, natural lighting and intense emotion, it is a brilliant must see historical revenge adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Original Music for Ryuichi Sakamoto and Carsten Nicolai and Best Makeup and Hair, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. Outstanding!Leonardo DiCaprio said what needed to get said "The Revenant" marks a big turn for both star Leonardo DiCaprio and director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu. Following up on his roles as maniacal tycoons in "Django Unchained" and "The Wolf of Wall Street", DiCaprio plays a fur trapper abandoned in the snowed-in wilderness. It's intense enough knowing that this was a true story, but how they film it makes it even more so. Like "Birdman", the movie contains several long shots filmed in a naturalistic style to create a sense of realism. Hugh Glass's determination to survive and find those who abandoned him provides one of the most harrowing stories ever put on screen. Covered in blood, sweat and dirt, DiCaprio spends much of the movie not talking, keeping the focus on his actions. And by actions, I mean that you rarely see something this intense on screen. I'd say that the movie deserved its Golden Globe wins (but it repeatedly irritated me that the presenters kept mispronouncing Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu's name). And while accepting his award, DiCaprio spoke up for the world's indigenous peoples and called on people to protect the environment from corporate interests. Indeed we should heed his call. In the meantime, definitely see "The Revenant". It's an experience like you can't imagine.** What was all the hype about regarding this colossal miserable film? The film starts off too brutal for me with the Indians on the rampage, killing off many of the traders. Am still wondering why Leonardo Di Caprio won the best actor Oscar for this film? He gave many other much better performances in other films. The choice was ridiculous. The one shining spot of this horrible film was the supporting performance by Tom Hardy as the villain, who justified his evil ways by way of religion. This basically comes down to revenge and it's amazing that DiCaprio could ever survive the mauling by that bear to regain the stamina needed to track down Hardy, who had killed his son in the interim. Yes, the scenery is unusual but it best reflects the mood of the entire film.A gripping tale of survival and revenge Hugh Glass is working as a guide for a group of trappers when they are ambushed by a group of native Arikara who are looking for their chief's kidnapped daughter. The surviving trappers along with Glass and his son escape down river but not long afterwards Glass is horrifically mauled by a bear. He manages to kill it but only just survives. While the main party go ahead to get help Glass is left with his son and two of the trappers. Fitzgerald, the elder trapper thinks they should leave him despite being paid a bonus. When he thinks they are alone he tries to smother Glass but is stopped by his son who he then murders. Glass is then left all alone in the wilderness and isn't expected to last more than a few hours¬Ö however he does survive and struggles back to health and starts to make his way back to Fort Kiowa. He will have a struggle to find anything to eat and must cross hostile territory to get there; it will test him to the limit of his endurance. Meanwhile Fitzgerald has made it back to Fort Kiowa and has told everybody he did everything he could to save Glass; when Glass finally gets there he will want his revenge. Like so many stories 'based on real events' a little bit of reading suggests quite a few liberties have been taken with the actual facts¬Ö that doesn't matter too much though as this is still a fine story. The opening ambush is exciting and quickly got me gripped. The story got even more tense afterwards. The bear attack was brilliantly shot in a way that made it look very real and very brutal. Once he is alone in the wilderness the film perfectly captures the bleakness of terrain; you can almost feel the cold as Glass struggles through snow, icy water and even shelters inside the remains of a dead horse. The cast does a fine job; it isn't surprising that Leonardo DiCaprio earned an Oscar for this he did a great job as Glass and certainly suffered for his art in the freezing conditions. The rest of the cast are impressive too; especially Tom Hardy, who plays the villainous Fitzgerald. At two and a half hours this certainly isn't a short film but at no time did I find myself looking at the clock. Overall I'd certainly recommend it although some of the more violent scenes might bother some viewers."As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight". There aren't many moments in the movie that aren't intense as hell. The brutality of the Indian attack that opens the story is barely over when the picture launches into the media hyped bear attack on the principal character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. I'm not a fan of his but I can recognize the amount of effort that went into this role, and so I feel his Best Actor award is well earned. Before the Oscars were announced I had a feeling the picture would take the top award as well, that was before I saw the film. I can see how this movie might not have been at the top of Academy members' voting lists. It's not an easy picture to watch, as many of the scenes like the one showing the results of the bear mauling are cringe worthy. It reminded me of the wounds in "The Passion of the Christ" and leaves you wondering how mere mortals could possibly survive them even in normal conditions, let alone the harsh environment trapper Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) found himself in. One's attention as the viewer is constantly reminded of the unforgiving nature of the terrain Glass must fight his way through to seek vengeance on the man who left him for dead. The entire picture is a testament to one man's perseverance, exemplified by Glass's own words in my summary line above.Bad and boring The beginning is OK, but the rest is crap. A man is mutilated by a grizzly bear and evil men let him lye 'dying' and almost buried. But he soon very fast recovers unexpectually and can do everything in the wilderness. i expected to see an interesting and exiting movie but it turned out to be exceptional bad and boring - one of the worst movies I have ever experienced. How in the world can this ridiculous unwillingly funny movie get so good reviews ..? Sudently he stands up and walks and talks and crawles along this lengthy movie. I can see a purpose in this film but, my god it is weitten in capital letters". I did not feel anything about him, just laughing at this rediculess and unsatisfiing movie. What a turn off.Boring, non realistic, time wasting First of all, if Di Caprio would get the Oscar with this movie, that would be a real shock to me. The movie starts quite energetic and attracts the audience, nevertheless when the story starts, it is too slow, quite boring and non realistic. when I watched the movie, I have remembered the road runner that never dies. You must watch the movie without conscious to enjoy. Many scenes and actions are out of nature. Also it is too long, well one can suppose to see good panoramic scenes nevertheless they are not included. I really spent my 3 hours for almost nothing. Simply it was a sample of bad story telling and scene directing for me.Worst acting and directing I've seen in quite a while I cannot fathom how this awful movie won awards! Leonardo DiCaprio did his worst acting ever; the directing was horrid; and the scenery was dark and undefined throughout. Many parts were slow and drawn out to show ugly gray or white scenery or for reasons I could not ascertain. Tom Hardy said that God was a squirrel. The camera remained on him for about 30 seconds, as if he'd said something profound. A very obvious mistake the director made throughout was overlooking Leonardo's well manicured nails. He is in the wild for days/weeks. His beard grows, hair grows, lips get all nasty looking, yet those nails remain perfectly manicured. Okay, now imagine you are freezing and left to die in a grave with a little dirt thrown on you. What would you do first? Yes! You would try to find your son, but then you would build a fire! Instead, they show Leonardo throwing on his furs and marching off into the woods. All Leonardo did in the movie was grunt,groan, and make the same faces over and over. He had very few lines to say. However, when he should have absolutely screamed his lungs out, he made not even a grimace. That was when he was getting into the freezing water to keep from being seen by the Indians. With open cuts and freezing water, he should have had a huge facial and physical reaction, even if he didn't want them to hear him scream in pain. From there, this director has him seen floating along in the icy river longer than a human can survive without drowning from hypothermia. When Leonardo finally gets out of the water, he is not even shivering. My husband caught a part where Leonardo shot twice without reloading. I mean, was this director smoking crack the whole time this was being filmed?! And he and Leonardo got awards! It floors me. This movie didn't even make enough money to cover its budget! All this money and time spent on a movie and it is pitiful. A great movie about a sniper can't get an award, but they award this trash?! The actor Tom Hardy is the one who did the best acting. HE should have gotten the best actor award! Some of the other actors were good also. I will never go to another movie directed by this incompetent director. Elitests in Hollywood gave him an award, the film an award, and Leonardo an award. I'm the movie goer. Therefore, my decision is what counts. Only Tom Hardy would have received an award from me. If I could, I would take all 3 awards and give them to the sniper movie by Clint Eastwood, which was shamelessly blackballed by those same Hollywood elitists.It's clear the director has never been outdoors! Some awesome scenery, and an attempt at a feel good story gone horribly wrong! I realize that most people don't have any survival training but I would guess that more than a few have common sense; and if you have any common sense, this movie is insulting!  1. When you are struggling to stay alive in sub zero weather, certain death will come if you get your clothes wet.......he does it repeatedly. 2. When you are trying to survive among hostile Indians, you only build a fire to save your life and then you build a well hidden fire the size of your hat because Indians will see/smell your fire.......he builds bon-fires out in the open. 3. A muzzle-loading weapon can only be fired once, you must then reload it which takes roughly 30 seconds for the most accomplished user......he shoots multiple times, rapid fire, with a muzzle loading pistol. 4. While it's true that you can survive in the cold by gutting your horse and using it's internal warmth to save your life, a full grown man cannot climb inside the chest cavity of a gutted horse.......the horse would have to be 20 feet long. I understand creative license for directors but this was just awful!
Overrated movie lacking direction This movie was built up by the trailers and I was actually excited to see it. The fact of the matter is that this movie is boring and not worth seeing. How major movie critics almost unanimously gave this movie positive reviews really makes no sense. Googling reviews for this movie proves to be much more telling than the scores it received on "reputable" websites. The scores are overblown because people were being generous with negative scores and way too generous with positive reviews by giving perfect scores to this mess of a movie. If you want to watch a movie and feel really uncomfortable this is for you. The emotions are forced at the viewer and explained by a plot that falls apart like the memories in the movie. Unfortunately my memory of this movie will remain.I feel like everybody has missed the point I am not normally one to write reviews, but I couldn't help reading several for this film on this site that just did't seem to understand where I think the film was supposed to be coming from. The majority of the complaints I saw were that the film was 'too depressing for a children's film', but whilst I see where they are coming from in some regards, every child who I have seen watch this film (I work in a cinema) has absolutely loved it, and laughed out loud almost constantly. They are not old enough to realise the message the film is trying to convey: that life isn't all about happiness. I applaud the attempt from Pixar to make a film that is not only hilarious in places, but is also a major comment on what life is like to be a younger teenager, transitioning through one of the most important moments of life.  From a more personal perspective, why should everything we show our children gloss over the reality of life, and try to make them believe everything is rosy 24/7? Again, what this film does brilliantly through the message I took away at the end was that life will never be 100% full of happiness, but that is fine. Why does it have to be? A little bit of sadness is necessary. If a person was never sad, they would be inhumane.  Overall then, I suppose my review is more of a comment on the type of film we exhibit to children, and how the Nanny-state we live in looks to protect them from most of lives inevitabilities. Either way, what can't be ignored is that this film is equal parts sad, and equal parts what I am sure will become a timeless classic in years to come.One of the worst and boring Disney films period! I have not seen every Disney Pixar film. The ones I have watched are the Toy Story films, Monsters Inc and it's sequel Monster University, a Bugs Life, Cars, Finding Nemo &amp; The Incredibles. The ones I have not seen are Wall-e, Ratouttlie, Brave, Cars 2 and The Good Dinosaur. Most of the ones I seen were either great or not bad. My favourite Disney film is the Lion King followed by the Jungle Book (1967) and Pinocchio. But this film is one of the worst and boring Disney films I have ever seen! The film is about a little girl named Riley who moves to a new home in San Franscisco after her dad gets a new job and her mind is controlled by a group of creatures known as 'emotions' who get her through everyday life but two of them Joy and Sadness end up in the bowls of Riley's mind where old memories are stored and without them especially Joy Riley's life is misery at home and school. This film was just awful. This film may be family friendly but the film is nothing like a film for children. There is very little comedy and is more adult-themed than the other Pixar films. It is my opinion also that this film shares similarities to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Exorcist and The Land Before Time. Like in Snow White the emotions have names matching that of their personality. For example Joy is all happy and optimistic while Sadness is like Eeyore by being downright miserable. Like Regan McNeil of The Exorcist Riley is processed in her mind but by the emotions and not a demon named Pazuzu while her parents and presumably everyone in the film are also processed by emotions. The film's sub plot where Joy and Sadness try to get back to headquarters is a throwback to the Land Before Time where Littlefoot and his friends try to find the Great Valley.  I also felt the film was rushed and none of the characters apart from Riley, Joy and Sadness get much screen time. Even Anger, Fear and Disgust hardly get involved in the film. Disgust arguably was the emotion who got demoted to extra. The film was as I said rubbish and how people loved this film has left me stumped. To me this film does not deserve a sequel as this film is just not good enough for one.Over Simplified I get that this is a kids film &amp; they were trying to use simple ways of showing how emotions are formed but I can't forgive the fact that the whole plot was about how a little girl was suffering from depression because, due to a clerical error, happiness was out of office. &amp; the final lesson just felt like "Cry &amp; everything will be alright".  Given how much praise this film was receiving (let alone it's a Pixar film) I was hoping for a much smarter explanation of emotions. Also most other aspects of the film just weren't funny/enjoyable.Worst one ever The film was awful and extremely boring. It was just so depressing and sadness was possibly the most annoying character ever conceived...why why why did she have to keep touching things after she was told over and over not to, just irritating. It got to the point where I was dreading the character coming on the telly. Animated Disney/pixar films should stick to what they are good at and that's making children (and adults) happy. Yes they can have a moral lesson and sad bits but the general overtone is happiness not depressing characters inside another depressing character that I couldn't care less about. Should never have been made, should have saved their money. Im very sad that I can never get back the time I wasted on it...I could have watched paint dry.Very boring for a children's movie I had high hopes of Inside Out before heading to the movie theater to go see it. The movie had lots of promotion on TV and Disney Channel where kids mainly go to see the exciting movies coming to a theatre near them. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed in this movie.  I have to admit that the idea of the story was great and very creative, especially to young children. Other than that, the lack of character development and no good plot development ruined the entire film for me. Almost the entire movie consists of Joy and Sadness walking around that large area of Riley's memories, attempting to find their way back to headquarters, while the other emotions nonchalantly mess everything up (I don't get why Joy was the only emotion with some commonsense). Of course, along the way, they met a spunky elephant (mixed with some other animals) who managed to make situations worse more than making them better, and of course, he had to die at the end because, reality check, it's a Disney film. And their goal is to somehow make you cry one way or another. I just didn't get how the elephant disappeared so quickly, considering he hadn't been down the forgotten memory abyss that long. If the memories died so quickly like he had, why were their thousands of old grey memories still intact?  Anyway, that's only a small screw-up compared to the rest of the movie. I felt like I had been constantly waiting for more character development for Riley but once again, I was let down. The entire movie revolved more around the emotions more than Riley, who from the trailer, seemed to be the star of the show. I could go on and on about the huge flaws and plot holes but I only have a limit of a thousand words. Do yourself a favor and spare the $7.50 and wasted hour that you'll never get back. I wouldn't watch that movie again if my life depended on it.Inside out worst pixar movie talk about lack luster in this movie and lack of joy , i had to endure watching this movie which had an awful plot , about some little girl with emotional center something goes screwy and she gets depressed and almost leaves home only to learn crying is good at the end . like how does that appeal to everyone ? talk about boring .The animated design for the characters was good but seriously pixar get your stuff together you had so many classic movies that would make this look like a piece of crap e.g wall-e , Up , incredible , monster inc, monsters university , brave, toy story1-3, ratatouille etc . Please bring those kinds of movies with great plot and fire the writers and director who wrote this movie . they should never set foot in the pixar company EVER!!Inside Out a Depressed Disney I went to see this with my 6 year old and 12 year old and we all left depressed and hating the movie. Disney needs to remember they are in the "entertainment" business. This is the second movie they have made lately that leaves you feeling worse after you saw it than you were before viewing it. Inside Out begins with a good story line, but sadness (better named depression)is the biggest part of the movie. Yes, there is realism. But, I prefer the "fantasy" part of cartoons where one can escape the bad and enjoy a light-hearted laugh for a bit. In my opinion, Disney head's need to see a professional about this depression they feel so compelled to share. I won't waste my money on another movie ticket to a Disney show until can see people laughing when they talk about the new show. I grew up with Disney movies and loved almost all of them. Am so sad that my kids can't have that same joy! This movie was such a waste of talent and time!!! Save your money and watch a DVD at home instead.Meet the Little Voices Telling You to Leave the Theater I am genuinely confused as to why people are calling this "Pixar's Best" or an original concept. Pixar has done far better than this and even the mediocre 'Brave' and 'Cars' are far better. Not only is the concept of 'people controlling your brain' tired and used multiple times, they managed to make it even more boring. There is absolutely no nuance in this film. The characters, (joy, anger, fear, disgust, sadness), are a visual representation of their emotion. I mean seriously, do they understand subtlety at all? Anger literally catches on fire, sadness is blue, and joy looks like every boring same-faced cartoon princess. Not to mention none of the emotions look like Riley, the little girl. This is even more of a flaw when we later see the emotions in other characters heads, (Riley's parents, her teacher, etc.) who look just like the person whose brain they inhabit. Why would Riley be the only one whose emotions all look nothing like her? They took an old concept, made it incredibly literal, and then botched it up with inconsistencies.  Aside from the boring concept, this movie is way too complex and depressing for children. The plot is nearly nonexistent and the most constant thing throughout is joy and sadness attempting to get back to the control center of Riley's brain after being sucked out by accident. Other than that its all very dull and if it doesn't make you cry, you'll probably fall asleep. There are, from what I remember, no laugh out loud jokes. Way too much time went into world-building and showing off the various landscapes and rooms of Riley's mind for there to be any actual storyline. Everything felt extremely dragged out and joy and sadness ran into obstacle after obstacle trying to get back to the control center. Finally, Riley tries to run away and it just so happens that joy returns and fixes everything before she has the chance to get too far. Not only was it absurd for an 11 year old girl to try and take a bus back home, it was far too sad the way the whole thing was shown.  There were so many random characters introduced for 5 seconds which served no purpose other than to lighten the mood, and they failed at that too. Bing Bong the imaginary friend who was a furry pink elephant was out of place and his design was really uncreative. When he died, I honestly felt relieved not to hear his irritating voice any more. He had no personality or character development and therefore there wasn't any reason to feel sad when he died. Unles of course you're a little kid in which case the whole thing was way too heavy. Either way its a definite miss. And for those saying only psychology majors can enjoy this movie, that's not true. I can't imagine anyone honestly liking this movie. Aside from the complete inaccuracy of anyone feeling only one emotion at a time, everything about this movie was casually ableist. The portrayal of depression as being something small and easily gotten over was incorrect and terrible. Even the advertisements ("Meet the Little Voices Inside Your Head") felt like an insensitive joke towards people with schizophrenia or other disorders who have auditory hallucinations. Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Too depressing and confusing for kids, too boring and literal for adults, this movie is enjoyable by no one. Pixar did not please its intended audience, nor did it please the grown ups. The one redeeming factor was the animation, which was good but all the designs were so uncreative that good animation couldn't save it.Pixar, how far you have fallen...because this movie was terrible. Really. There are a few reasons why I consider this movie terrible and why I find it so horrifying that it's current rating is 8.5 when Spirited Away--one of the best animated movies ever created--is sitting at 8.6. Long story short, the characters were for the most part difficult to like. Joy was thoughtlessly cruel and condescending to Sadness and the other emotions, and Riley--the girl we're all supposed to love and find easy to relate to--was extremely obnoxious/egocentric and rubbed me the wrong way for the entire movie. I resented the stereotypes that were used and found them more than a little insulting. For example, Riley has an "imaginary boyfriend" at the age of 12. I don't know about you people, but I find this extremely concerning. 12 year old girls should NOT be thinking that they should have boyfriends at their age--while it may start out innocent, it can unconsciously encourage premature sexual thoughts and activity, which is EXTREMELY unhealthy and dangerous at their age. Also, I don't personally know any girls (including myself) who ACTUALLY had imaginary boyfriends. Ever. Let alone at 12! And don't even get me started on the imaginary friend Bing-Bong. BING-BONG! That's actually his name! I found him irritating and, frankly, disturbing. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm sure young children will LOVE this movie, and maybe some parents and teenagers as well. However, on the whole, I would NOT consider it up to par with other Disney Pixar movies. It was compared to "UP" for Pete's sake--the movie that had EVERYONE crying within the first 10 minutes! It was an enormous let- down for me, especially since all the raving had really caused me to build it up, which made it all the more disappointing. Therefore, watch at your own peril. Consider yourself warned.Poor imagination and no fun turns the movie upside down. This still had some appeal as a trailer but sadly as a whole it felt flat pretty fast. The whole movie had a depressing effect and this became more obvious as the movie progressed. The basic story was some what ridiculous about only 5 characters controlling your brain similar to the factions in divergent(same screenplay writer perhaps?) Of the 5 characters 2 are highlighted and both of them (Joy and Sadness)are just annoying and the 3 side characters are totally forgettable. Problem here is they always react the same making it very predictable and there for equals boring. It has not been a good animation year, only the penguins worked and Minions and now this one really failed miserable. So,please ,put the fun and laughs back in these movies and stop with putting adult subjects in to kids movies. That might have worked once but at this point you're overdoing it. I think this one was rushed and not as well worked out as previous installments by pixar and I do hope they find they're way again and return to the classics we all know and love. Re-animate.Inside Out, Upside Down I have never entered in such a poor review for a Disney film. I am always defending the "Imagineers" and their creative processes. I'm a Floridian..not a true Florida cracker, more of a saltine (or maybe a Triscuit). But, my love for all things Disney ended with Inside Out.  The premise was really great, in concept, but extremely poorly enacted. So, yeah, OK, you've got your emotions, "Joy, Anger, Sadness, Disgust, etc...." Yeah, it's that bad. An etc. Do I really need to say more?  Well, of course, there's more. Riley is THE perfect girl. But really, what she is, is sheltered. A good family. Parents that worship her. A core group of friends and education, extracurricular activities, etc.  Yeah, another etc.  Societal norms and mor√©s dictate that this is really not the case. Having both parents, let alone both parents being married, is an event these days. Sure, we'd all love to believe that those idyllic family structures still exist. But, truly, ask your children, it isn't even close.  So, let's go ahead and move this "perfect" family, because of Dad's job (yeah, cuz that's an original storyline) and plunk em down in Cali from Minnesota. Disney/Pixar's attempts to poke fun at Vegan lifestyles to get the viewer closer to the family is pretty weak. As is the whole system of forming and processing memories.  Leading us all to believe that joy is the most powerful and important emotion. When, in the end, sadness rules the roost. Ummmm, what?  All "core memories" are formed by sadness and touched by joy. Please.  The disconnect between the emotions and the girl is huge. Watching a movie that is supposed to be happening inside this girl is confusing. Riley's actions are so delayed that is clear that we're all watching minutes of dialogue before she reacts. It's distracting. Not to mention pretty lame.  It seems Disney/Pixar kinda realized this and decided to showcase Riley's emotions while she was asleep. Believable. Mmhhmm. Yeah, ummmm, no.  Throw in a couple of distracted parents and stress, not even real stress, a kind of implied stress, and they're you have the whole basis of the film. Pretty shaky.  I saw this film with an 11 and 12 year old. Both girls Riley's age. Now, granted, these girls have great families...but they also have mothers going through terminal illness and fathers that work their trails off to make ends meet. So their emotions run high. But they aren't cry prone girls. And yet, here we were, popcorn, candy, sodas for breakfast watching this horrible film. Both girls in tears and a very well placed f-bomb by yours truly to lighten the mood.  Bottom line? 90 minutes of confusing, sad, disjointed dialogue and about 5 minutes of happy. Never a laugh out loud. Maybe a smile. Maybe.  So, ummmm, what the hell Disney/Pixar? This the trend? If so, take me back to it being a small small world. It's way better than drilling these fake boyfriend thoughts of being our savior into our daughter's head. First were waiting for "our price to come." Now we're relying on fake boyfriends? Please.  How about a girl that can handle herself, her school, her family, and be strong? Not this lame nonsense.In a word, Lousy. Usually love Pixar, Toy Story for example, was easy and fun to follow up on the big screen but Inside Out is a jumble of fast talking characters, sudden bursts of sound that'll wake you up when you feel yourself drifting off. This movie is hard to follow, has a very sophisticated theme and so anyone under 10 probably won't sit through this one. For example there are about a 1/2 a dozen different characters that represent "feelings" ( anger, sadness, fear etc ) all talking at the same time in some instances. Then there are the complicated explanations of long term/short term memory, REM sleep cycles, I mean, If I were a 5 year old, I wouldn't know what was going on after about 10 mins, I'd be lost. Not to mention that there are long stretches of fast action accompanied by loud rather jarring music and shrill voices etc. It's a mess of a movie &amp; definitely not for the very young because they won't understand it, believe me.Tinkerbell with Pixar Animation I have been a Pixar fan since the Luxo Jr. days and watched their acquisition by Disney with trepidation. After seeing Inside Out, it appears that the Disneyfication of Pixar is now complete. This movie is just another one of those execrable Disney Tinkerbell movies with better actors and animation. It is so insipid that I wanted to leave within the first two minutes (ok, I actually wanted to leave during the horrible short that preceded it.) There was much laughter in the audience; all of it from children under the age of 6. Pixar movies always entertained people of all ages with their clever plots, excellent acting, and beautiful graphics. The animation of Inside Out was decent, the cast excellent, but I have nothing good to say about the rest. The plot was extremely derivative. There was absolutely no surprise about what was going to happen - once they set up the premise, it was obvious that we were doomed to another hour of their trying to get back, with mishaps along the way and the inevitable happy ending. It reminded me of the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 rock climbing episode (for those of you in the know). Even my teenager and her friend thought the movie and short were "babyish". I'm waiting until they make a princess sequel and have a ride named after it at Disneyland. Bye, bye Pixar. I'll miss you.The Cheese Stands Alone I simply cannot comprehend why this movie is being heralded as Pixar's finest. It is flawed in so many ways, which is uncharacteristic of Pixar. The concept is wholly unoriginal, which lead me to believe that Pixar would present us with something astounding to compensate, but what they have given us is unimaginative human characters whose personified emotions represent exhausted stereotypes. When we meet the father's emotions, they're lazily watching sports instead of taking an active interest in family dinner time, while the mother's emotions try to resign themselves to the fact that they have settled for a schlub instead of a handsome ex lover. The daughter is presented as the perfect all-American girl and we are never given even a glimpse of her being anything but perfect until the emotions Joy and Sadness find themselves ejected from the control center of her mind. Then suddenly she's the clich√©d brat that lazy story telling will have us believe of every tween and teenager. The most unbelievable action of this character comes when this seemingly ideal daughter decides that in order to be happy she should run away from her loving home and travel alone across the country. All the while, mom and dad take this in their stride as though she's always behaved this way. All this, we are shown, is because the only emotions running the show are anger, disgust and fear, since joy and sadness are still trying to return to the control center. By Pixar's logic, we are incapable of rational actions without joy and sadness. Okay, I get that it's a movie, but this is bad writing. At one point we are expected to accept Sadness's antics simply because she claims that she doesn't know why she's doing what she's doing. What!?! If the ones controlling the brain cannot account for their actions, then what is the point of the premise? Perhaps the sequel will show us the emotions inside the heads of the emotions sadness, joy and the rest. Aside from the terrible story line and lack of character depth, the film lacks the usual humor we have come to associate with Pixar, and while Joy and Sadness's quest to get back where they belong is undoubtedly frustrating for them, the constant obstacles they encounter make it almost unbearable to sit through. Mostly, I feel, because again and again they keep getting sooooo close, only to have something happen and they have to find another way, finally making it happen through the use of a stack of imaginary boyfriends. Let me say that again: They finally get back to control by stacking up a bunch of imaginary boyfriends. Yes, I know, it's a movie, and a cartoon at that, but this is Pixar. We have come to expect better. Well, I have, at least. Judging by the other reviews and the box office, Inside Out is a huge hit. I still cannot fathom why. I must be taking crazy pills.inside out of your mind what a complete waste of time - read all the wonderful reviews that are misleading, obviously these are the people that go to Disneyland about 20 times a year - incredibly slow paced, especially after "JOY" &amp; "SADNESS" get sucked into another dimension where they befriend Bing Bong, Riley's imaginary friend. Wow - it took forever. Bing Bong is the films JAR JAR BINKS, just so annoying and irritating. This is a definite G rated film. I did not see any adult themes whatsoever. This movie makes Winnie The Pooh look like a horror film. This is for 12 year old girls. Parents are so delusional(thanks for the positive reviews Mom &amp; Dad)Misery on a stick OK, playtime's over Pixar, now get over it. This film is so plainly a prequel ‚Äì c.f. references to a 'puberty' button on the new 'emote' console in the character Rileys brain - you will fail to find anything of entertaining value for your 100 minute investment. You may harbour fond memories of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille ‚Äì all unique, funny, thrilling and entertaining. But, that is not what you will get with Inside Out. 'Joy', after all, is banished to long-term memory and can't get back in charge of the console. (Since when was a single emotion ever 'in charge' anyway?). Inside Out can be taken as a metaphor for the poor sops who work for the Disney Corporation. Yes, they started out with true optimism about the life journey they had chosen, (with Pixar). Then, all of a sudden they are 'taken over' by a less than friendly peer. To compound this, they are moved from their original 'playpen' to a new post industrial work lot. All is grim. Sadness takes hold and taints everything that is done. Even 'Joy' begins to sob with sadness and grief. Save us from this self-indulgent misery. Not only is it inappropriate as kiddie oriented movie fodder, those of us who are sentient, self-aware adults can do without this additional mock unhappiness. By the way, most human brains have a 'fat controller' who orchestrates proceedings keeping everything on an even keel ‚Äì even if that is 'sadness' for a while. Riley's brain seems to be lobotomised ‚Äì even before puberty has hit. Give this film a wide berth, in fact, it might be best if someone scuttles this ship before the pestilence it's carrying spreads.Very original but for what audience Well I went to see this movie last night with a friend and I think for children under 10 the movie is to complex. The main human emotions were very original but the movie never got me in. The story was also not that good. I would not take my daughter to the movie and it is that my friend liked it, otherwise I would not even have finished it. I think this is not what we are used to from Pixar. All the other Pixar movies were watchable for adults and children but to be honest I thought it was pretty awful. The beginning before the movie started made me already feel that it would not be good. I can see why some people like it but I think there should have been a better storyline.Needs Philosophical and Psychological discussion There is a problem with psychological reality with this movie. The fact that it is presented as entertainment for children is an extreme negative. One of the most important thrusts of human evolution has been to free humans from the former mental encumbrances of past centuries. In this Movie the child is depicted as controlled by a number of entities, the child is in fact insane but depicted as normal. I am concerned as to the sanity of the person(s) who wrote this script. Such a movie disserves the bonfire. I am amazed that our Psychologists are not protesting the showing of this movie which demonstrates only the origins of western psychology - the cocaine importer and addict Sigmund Freud.To find the sun again I'm like various reviewers who consider themselves Pixar fans. In fact, I'm an animated film fan and try to see the award winners whenever I can. The beautiful colors and well developed art of Pixar is most often worth the cost of admission to me. But Inside Out is so awful it drove me and my significant other from the theater. The concept is much too heavy and involved to hold the attention of a child. Quickly obvious that this will not be a bit lighthearted and plummets into bleakness. Inside Out becomes doggedly repetitive, with the emotional balls in the air, flailing here and there. The characters in Pixar, have a noticeable sameness of facial features and gestures. "Joy" is reminiscent of other females from past movies. This time, the female lead is so over-the-top that, after a short while, I wanted to shout "shut up and go away!" I went to be entertained and have a laugh or two. I came away feeling that I'd been emotionally beaten up yet bored to tears. Leaving before the ending was actually with a feeling of relief at having escaped.Pixar has struck out I don't have a lot of reasons to give. All I can say is that every other Pixar movie I have rated a 10. I love animations, and the artwork for this one is top notch. Pixar has been terrific at delivering great stories until this one. I even love CARS, which many others found fault with. I wasn't in a bad mood when watching this one. I had great expectations. It's simply sucks. It's made a lot of money and has over an 8 rating, so I'm in the minority here. I want to caution someone like me to save their money so please read the other reviews with a 1 star rating. Maybe that will help guide you to a different movie to watch.Mind = Blown Yes, my mind is blown away by this movie not because it's spectacular as it was hailed by many critics but because this movie is super lame for a studio that has never released a bad movie (edit: i have forgotten about brave and cars 2 i guess pixar has lost their touch and that's why they made finding dory) CGI wise this movie has an outstanding work like usual but the real problem is the story. The first 1 hour of the movie i was waiting for the main problem that would be the objective of the story but i was actually watching it this whole time and watching it through the end i just felt nothing and said "is that it? what the heck?".  The climax/ending was very weak it was somehow really flat probably because the main obstacle itself was rather stupid. The movie environment seemed very dull and narrow especially for the imaginary part of the mind. The special 5 mind characters are annoying and predictable. The jokes and dialogs are not memorable. I don't know what kind of drugs these good reviewers are using but this is the worst Disney PIXAR movie yet, it's so bad that i decided to write my first review for this abomination of an animation. I would give this 5/10, but with the misleading score such as 8.4, i feel there is an obligation to demote it down hence the 1/10. For those who thinks this is a hate/bandwagon/troll attempt. no this is solely what i feel about this movie and it's a shame that people are so against bad reviews. TL;DR: this movie lacks a fun.My head hurts inside and out!! What is wrong with reviewers these days? Good movies get bad reviews and bad ones get good reviews. This movie belonged to the later category. No where near the all-round quality of a movie with a 8+ rating. Are the makers of the movie hiring third world reviewers to inflate the movie's rating? I think so. Numerous people hated this movie just as I did, but the movie's rating suggests otherwise. There were cute parts in the movie but was annoying and meanders along for the majority of it. No wow factor here. It's just another Hollywood Ponzi scheme. 1/10 to deflate rating to a more realistic value.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, let alone children The trailer was so misleading. It portrayed the film as funny, but this film is anything but.  It starts off where 11 year old Riley moves from Minnesota to California which she is unhappy about. She gets to the gloomy grey house in a gloomy grey street and you feel her depression and disappointment. It was California but there was no sunshine to speak of. You wouldn't expect this kind of bleakness in a film aimed at young people let alone children.  The film barely gave Riley any screen time and spent most of the time on emotions Joy and Sadness, who were both trapped outside brain headquarters and trying to get back. Sadness has to be the most annoying, unlike-able character. On the way they meet Bing Bong, Riley's old imaginary elephant friend. Seeing him cry because he's sad Riley no longer plays with him made me cry, but it gets worse, when he and Joy get trapped in a dump and both try to escape, they can't get out together because he's to heavy,so he let's her go alone, she looks back to see him disappearing into thin air while saying "take Riley to the moon for me". This was a Bambi sad moment. We never get reunited with Bing Bong and never see or hear from him again, this is such a downer, he was innocent,helpful and likable. There was one scene where Riley introduces herself to her new classmates and then bursts into tears because she didn't want to be there, I couldn't help but think this was an overreaction. Since Joy and Sadness were no longer in her mind she's only left with Disgust,Anger and Fear (these characters had nowhere near enough screen time and were much more entertaining than Joy and Sadness). She decides to steal money from her mother and run away back to Minnesota, but as soon as she's on the bus, Sadness and Joy have made it back to headquarters and Joy orders Sadness to do her work. Riley suddenly feels sadness and realising she'll miss her family changes her mind and runs back home. As soon as she sees her parents she starts crying and says she doesn't like living here. Her parents comfort her and the film ends there. So the moral of the story is its okay to cry and that all our emotions are important,even the bad ones. If Riley didn't feel sadness she would have never seen sense and went ahead with her stupid plan and probably end up being raped and murdered. Once the film is over you don't feel happy, nothing good really happened it was just wall to wall misery. Bing Bongs death, Riley being isolated from her parents, ditching her hobbies, losing her two important emotions, losing her old friends, hating her new house, eating lunch alone at her new school and running away. This is a Disney film right? Talk about putting bad ideas in children heads. After the film was over I felt sad for the rest of the day and night. I wish I never watched this.Horrible movie Horrible!  A few reasons this movie is nowhere near Toy Story//Nemo/Cars quality: Totally unlikeable flat characters, 0 original dialogue, too much talking needed to get the scene/point across, no real laughs, dialogue doesn't feel natural, voice acting never becomes "real" but remains "acting", it's too long/there's not enough content, music is in the way now and then. Just because the idea for this movie is "fresh" doesn't make it any good. The idea does not count. The movie does. Don't waste time with this! Complete crap! (and I love Pixar btw)Another Pixar classic This is the kind of Pixar movie that we are used to and that we love Pixar makes again another innovating and different story that has nothing to envy to the other Pixar's masterpieces such as Up, toy story, Ratatouille, the incredibles, etc This is the living prove that Pixar should stop producing sequels that are not bad movies but they are not even close to the Pixar standards. This movie show us an innovating and beautiful story that I'm sure that it's not like anything You have seen before, Pixar really knows how to make different animated movies and not the typical ones, an absolute triumph for PixarIt's just a kids film I saw a lot of people say how great this film is and I have to disagree. While this film does convey to children a message that life is not always perfect I still felt disconnected from the "characters". All the "characters" in this film were stereotypes and you could see how this film was going to play out 30 min in. The animation and environments were good and fun to look at but thats all they were, pretty. So I do agree it's a good kids movie but that does not mean its a good film.great jobs Great jobs of Pete Docter, Ronnie Del Carmen, Michael Giacchino and many others one !!!I cried?! Omg I cried at this film. I never thought I would but the story behind it is truly magical and inspiring.Could've been better. Plot - This movie is very predictable. This concept has been done before, and the overall story is very formulaic. Yes, its great for a kids' movie, but as a movie it isn't as great as it could've been. There are a lot of very dumb and contradictory plot devices that could've been handled better *cough* train of thought *cough*.  Animation - The animation is fantastic. I love all the detail and the way these different things are brought to life onscreen. There are a few things that probably could've been changed (for some reason the memories in the memory balls aren't from Riley's POV) but nothing that really ruins the movie.  Characters - I know that its the point that all the characters are as simplistic as possible, but it does make the movie a bit boring at times. South Park - I don't know why, but this movie rips off Imaginaionland from South Park. They even call it that. Of course, the South Park version is much more entertaining and creative, but its clear that its a similar idea. Of all the things that this childrens' movie could rip off, that was unexpected.  Overall this is a kinda average kids movie with amazing animation. There are a lot of creative plot devices that aren't handled anywhere near as well as they could've been. This movie gets points for effort and an air of creativity. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. Its a bit funny and a bit sad (I guess). If you are young, have kids, or are easily entertained then I'd recommend this. If you are easily annoyed by predictable nonsense, then I'd recommend skipping this one.Funny, really Sweet, and Heartwarming I love this film so much, because it's funny, because of Lewis Black's voice acting for Anger, really Sweet, because of Bing Bong, and Heartwarming, because of that touching scene near the end of the film, where Riley and her parents hug. I definitely recommend watching this film, and Kaitlyn Dias did an amazing job as Riley. All I can say is: "It's a really great film!". Kudos to you, Pixar, on an amazing film.A Beautiful Movie I found this movie beautiful and shows human emotions in ways that i found interesting and entertaining. It is a movie that has heart, skilled writing, and feelings that stay long after the credits roll. If you are looking for a movie that will truly make you feel then I suggest this movie.Deeper than the kola superdeep borehole (i had to google that joke) Holy hell this movie is amazing, the story seems simple and kinda eh tbh, BUT THE EXECUTION IS AMAZING, You see, the main story of the movie is that riley (the girl that is voiced by kaitlyn dias) has moved from another town, and her emotions are all mixed up, but she seems happy all the time, because she wants to hide her depression that she is deeply into, the animation is spectacular (is pixar what were you expecting?) and its amazing how much this movie can get away with, like for example, riley tries to run away from all and everyone and even her parents, and the animation shows that, imo its a great movie for everyone 10/10fall in love story My friend told me about this movie and i think it is normal like another movies but when i saw it the things took another turn i love it so much this movie talk about us about our life from the begin to the end it is make us think how we feel and why we feel and how our feeling evolved over timeA Creative Piece Of Work If you love animation and Pixar, then you should watch this film. This was one of the most creative pieces of work Pixar has ever done! The characters are lovable and memorable, the story is very well-thought, and the lesson is touching. I'm going to say it again but if you love creativity and animation you should definitely check out this film.You need to look deeper into this film y'all Many people keep calling out this film for being very depressing, poorly-developed, or whatever other reason that I don't think I can understand. But the problem is, you don't look deeper into it. Do you really expect your children to understand depression, or expect life to be all peachy and happy and beautiful and sunshiny? Newsflash, you're ignorant. This is not reality. As a person with depression, this film hit me hard. There's always a part of you that wants to deny the emotions that come with growing up, you want to remain happy, or neutral at the very least, for the people you love who are surrounded by stress. But in truth, when you try to avoid them, it only makes it worse. This film taught me to embrace my emotions, and be open with it to the people I trust. I was in tears as I watched this film, because while the situation was not the same as what I was going through, the emotions Riley felt and what I felt were very similar. It was what I needed to help me heal from the emotional pain that I was going through at the time. It isn't easy to teach your children that they cannot avoid pain or depression forever, so I say Inside Out is a good start to teaching them that. Inside Out, to me, is the best Disney movie. Emotions are a complicated topic reduced to a very simple concept in this movie. It's colorful, funny, and imaginative, all surrounding a complicated yet beautiful tale of how your feelings are normal and shouldn't be pushed away, but rather, you should be honest about them in order to heal.  thank you, and goodnight. -drops mic-Best cartoon movie in my heart I watched this movie when I am not in a good mood period and I cried a lot during watching. I was surprised by the whole idea of the movie because it shows a different world explaining how we act daily in a reasonable way. Furthermore, I was touched by the fact that things truly get destroyed but don't worry, we can still get better things after that cruel experience. I was afraid of destruction but this movie gives me huge courage to face the future!If you were looking for the cringiest, most awkward people on the planet... Look no further than this movie's review section. How anyone can go below 8/10 on a timeless classic like this is beyond me. I don't know what else to say. I imagine the people or (or lowlife with too much time and too many fake accounts) that try to shoot down this film, they probably have been seriously triggered in some way, on a deep emotional level. Do you think you should be happy 24/7? Do you think sadness has no value? Do you not believe in scientific concepts (the brain, emotion, memory, neuroscience) which are in abundance in the film? The type of person to hammer this film, I would not want my kids to be within 2 miles of that person, much less do I think that person should be trusted to have kids of their own.  Please go fix yourself, and stop spewing your diarrhea into IMDB on movies that are quite obviously masterpieces in film.Short-Lived Emotions From The Inside Movie Review: "Inside Out" (2015) An originally-conceived story by Pixar director Pete Docter and former storyboard artist Ronnie Del Carmen gets turned into a 175 Million U.S. Dollar production at Pixar Animation Studios with executive producer John Lasseter holding strings of continued originality to please distributing parent Walt Disney Pictures in Summer of 2015 for short-lived universal audience movie pleasures, when "Inside Out" hits theatres around the world by sharing visualized emotions of 10-year-old girl Riley, who just struggles from being moved from the U.S. countryside to the city of San Francisco at the Pacific coast. The animation work is not as beautiful sketched-out as the previous-released stand-alone Pixar movie "Brave" from Summer 2012. Nevertheless "Inside Out" becomes a kaleidoscope of imaginative ideas as a mutual effort for all departments at the legendary CGI-animation studio, resighting in Emeryville, California orginating from Lucasfilm Computer Division in 1986. All up front lead the main character's emotions into the mind of place-in-life-finding Riley between duties of organizing daily routines between mom and dad, close-to unrecognizable vocal portrayals by actress Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan, school and home-made girl leisures, when fairly visualized figures of basic emotion Joy as yellow glowing, blue-haired girl to Sadness in white turtle-neck pullover with short-sighted horn glasses over Disgust as cocky green young adult to show-stealing Anger all redish, drawn as hardcore clerk man with tie wearing brown pants, who constantly fights it out with slender, broken-neck looking as pale purple character of Fear in loveless-designed main interiors of the girl's mind control station. What keeps this particular Pixar movie alive over the unless always perfectly-paced company editorials, here under reprising editor Kevin Nolting, known for the originally better picture "Up" also directed by Pete Docter, are moments of pure animated movie magic, when the character of Bing Bong, portrayed by highly-skilled voice actor Richard Kind, recalling the unforgettable "Pink Elephant" sequence from Walt Disney's "Dumbo" of the year 1941; a reminiscence worthwhile and in-production for a live-action revival in 2019 under Tim Burton's directorial vision. ¬© 2018 Felix Alexander Dausend (Cinemajesty Entertainments LLC)Pixar still has it I thought Pixar had lost their fastball after their last couple efforts. Never mind. This movie once again made me both laugh and cry. Also, it did that with the most unique and original story I had seen in a long time. Inventive and amazing stuff.An animation for all ages Pretty well made animation meant for all ages in which illustrate how mind work as whole. The emotions have been clearly displayed within in this animation as well as their play on one's characteristics, personality and decision making. I beautiful journey in one's mind taking you along on joy, sadness, discuss as well as risk experience within the mind. The analogies used within this animation are priceless and can give pretty good insight to understand our mind as well as people's mind around us. This animation could have pretty constructive effect on children how to acknowledge their feeling and grow up with better understanding.I adore Inside Out! Inside Out, is fantastic! In fact, the general reviewer consensus is that this movie is one of the cleverest and most original films that Pixar, or anyone else has ever made. And yes, I know because one of the most frequent words to praise this film is original, the entire internet is now putting in all their efforts to prove to everyone else that it's not. Now I know that this is not the first movie, or animation to illustrate personifications of emotions, or internal thought processes; And even as far as Pixar goes, this is hardly the first movie about about two conflicting characters going on a journey in an otherworldly atmosphere. But this is the first time it's been done in a full length family animation with these particular emotions, executed with this level of clever metaphor for the progressing emotional development of a child, so yes, it's still pretty original. Besides, concept is one factor, and execution is another, and in Pixar fashion, it is fine-tuned to a tee to be easily comprehensible, frequently funny, emotionally relatable, with fun and memorable characters. Inside Out is about the interactions of emotions, inside of a person's head personified as characters. The person in this case, is an 11-year-old girl named Riley; an incredibly happy and well-adjusted child, until her life is completely uprooted, when her family moves to San Francisco. And the movie covers the literally emotional journey that follows. Most of the story takes place inside her mind, and the world the filmakers created to represent the various cerebral functions, is one of the most interesting, engaging aspects of a family movie, that I've seen in a while. Not just in the very likable characters displaying the arguably core emotions, but also how it conveys functions, like long-term memory, personality, dreams, abstract thought, forgetting, subconsciousness, etc. Most of the movie I imagine, you'll be marveling at the incredibly intriguing metaphorical portrayals of these concepts, and also probably thinking about all the extraneous details the film didn't have time to address, like; shouldn't there be some sort of connection between the subconscious, and dream production? But if there's a single element that showcases the film's brilliant design, with near perfect entertaining execution, it's the emotional characters themselves. You think the characters meant to embody a single emotion would be one-note, but the movie makes it clear that their purpose is not just merely spontaneously reacting to things; The emotions all have motivations to serve a particular need, like fear assesses danger, disgust is her sense of literal and social tastes, and anger protects her from being treated unfairly. They all have very appropriate, and entertaining personalities.  But the true protagonists of the story are joy, and sadness, who are the ones to embark on the journey, to help Riley get through her emotional crisis, after well, causing it. Pixar has this, frankly brilliant habit of telling stories from the point of view of characters meant to represent parents. And joy is right in this wheelhouse, in her caring and her good intentions, but also for her intrusive, perkiness. Along with Amy Polher's performance, the tireless animation, and the writing, Joy was able to work as an intriguingly flawed protagonist, as well as likable, and entertaining. And it's really that ability to make those sorts of characters, under those sorts to conditions likable that really is Pixar's superpower. Bing Bong was helpful, caring, funny and lovable. Like joy, his success is attributed to the film's execution; culminating with the film's ultimate philosophy about the conflicting relationship between joy and sadness. And by that, I mean the literal relationship between the happy and sad emotions, because the characters, never really connect that much. But then the film's final conclusion is so mutually devastating, uplifting, and accurate, this film would probably become mandatory watching for preteens, even if everything else about it had failed. Overall, this movie was PERFECT.inside out This cartoon film I consider to be the best in all cartoon production. When I started to look at it, it was not at all clear to me how with the help of just five emotions it is possible to describe a human feeling. But the creators of this masterpiece it turned out incomparably. Of course, a person has more emotions, but if you show each one, then you need to shoot the series for a huge number of episodes. Although, this is not a bad idea. Each of the presented emotions is perfectly and very accurately shown. I am more than anyone, I liked Sadness. Strange, but true. When her joy dragged her leg, and she lamented, I laughed without stopping. I was also struck by a very precise moment with the erasure of telephone numbers in my memory. When I thought about it, I realized that I would not remember a single number of my friends. And remember in childhood, as we called each other, dialing numbers from memory. I highly recommend that this cartoon look to everyoneAwesome! My favorite Walt Disney movie of all time is this. The special effects are brilliant, and acting is very good, the plot is really easy to follow. The movie does it so well and so smart. The only word I can describe it is genius, this is a genius movie. I love this energy that all the emotions had in this movie and the movie has a great lesson behind it. I feel like adults are gonna like this movie more than kids because adults are can love how this movie explain emotional states. If you have emotions and you have felt emotions you're definitely watch this movie!!!GD17D015 D. Turbold BS100 Inside Out is an outstandingly original, heartfelt story from Pixar about growing up and learning to handle your biggest emotions. Told primarily from the perspective of the feelings inside 11-year-old Riley's mind the plot has many moments including bridges/islands crumbling, a train tumbling over a precipice, and characters falling into a deep, dark pit. Some of Riley's fears are also on display, including a giant, scary clown. Parents are likely to get hit hardest by the film's heart-tugging moments, but anyone with empathy will feel for Riley as she experiences life's ups and downs. Ultimately, Inside Out has important messages about needing to feel and express all of your emotions, whether happy or sad. Although most of the content is appropriate for elementary schoolers and up, younger kids may need a bit more explanation about what's going on, since there are references to abstract thought and the subconscious, and it can be a little confusing when other characters emotions are shown.BS-100 IJ17D021 KH.KHulan Inside Out review I enjoyed the movie. I couldn't imagine how they would make a whole movie from the point of view of the human emotions, but it came out well. And it was really funny movie,with a lot of laughter throughout the movie. I felt lot of emotional from the movie. And I understood lot of important things. This animation has an important message. It brings up family love, respect and never give up... One important truth that I noticed was that you can't have joy without sadness as well, so sadness was a main character for this reason. I found this to be an extremely creative and thought provoking film. The overall theme of family was important. At the begin of animation about grateful family. Father and mother both kind and loving to each other and the daughter. Suddenly, mind of daughter changes. Because her mind makes a trouble from inside out. Finally, Her mind understood most important thing of human life rules. The role of sadness as a vital emotion was really interesting. I liked that. I recommend it. It was very funny, sweet and a great overall family film.BS-100 jr17d006 This is one of the greatest animated movies I've seen. Kids love because characters are fun and really cute movie. they show in the movie the basic feelings in one head of human. The story is friendly and graphic is really beautiful. I think it is for every children and adults, every ages. This is too why it is good for everybody. And i hope it will be more episodes from this movie.ir17d029 BS-100 The first time i watched this,I was excited.The graphics are so nice.Ever i don't watch animations and cartoons.But i liked it.I think it was so imaginative and edifying.Actually,everyone has own feelings. There are angry,happy,sad and so on.But person decides to be happy,because now i am young! Finally,i would recommend you to watch this movie.You won't regret it.Bs 100 Enkhjin Pretty good .First of all i think this movie is first psychological cartoon.And It might be boring for little children.They would not understand it perfectly.Its made for all ages of people.I liked the main character Riley.I felt like i'am seeing my self that when i was 10 years old i used to act like this.There was nothing i liked.I understand that if something bad happened or if you're uncomfortable about something just don't wait to make it seems to okay.Just say and talk with other people.You shouldn't unhappy for others decision.We all become sad sometimes.Maybe heartbreaking or crying is one way to make better .And its nonsense to be happy all the time.Just make it happen or do what you want.Most important things in life is family friends and things that you make happy.I think adults can learn so much more than kids and teens because they've been through those things and they can learn from their mistakes and so much more many things in such an easier way.Very good I think it is a really good movie.Because they show in the movie the basic feelings in one head of human. The story is really cute and friendly. The graphic is really beautiful. I think it is for every children and adults, every ages. This is too why it is good for everybody. And i hope it will be more episodes from this movie.I liked this movie I wanna part 22222222 I love this movie Iwanna part 22222222 Ilove this movieThis is the Pixar I Know and Love Please excuse any mistakes as my English is not very good. There are no spoilers in this review. I had the pleasure of seeing 'Inside Out' at the Cannes Film Festival and I must say it was wonderful and a huge step-up from Pixar's recent efforts. The trailers don't really do it justice. The story may seem complicated for younger viewers, but the way Pixar tells the story fits for both adults and children. The pacing is in the vein of Wall-E, and in that sense it is very much a film for adults as it is for kids (like most Pixar movies). The story here is surprisingly raw and emotional, one that has very deep underlying themes that adults will connect with. Many of the audience members were crying at the end. It has one of the most original stories for an animation in the last few years, and I believe many people (especially adults) will form a connection to it. Speaking of animation, the film is breathtakingly beautiful. There is a nice contrast of colors that make it look vibrant, like Pixar's 'UP'. The voice cast did a wonderful job and you couldn't ask for better direction from Pete Doctor and co. I cannot wait to see this a second time with family and friends. Highly recommended. PS: The short that played before the film, 'Lava', was also beautiful. It was sort of a musical, and it was quite funny and clever. The audience even applauded at the end of it, myself included. In that sense, it provides the entire package a nice balance of joy and laughter (Lava) followed by deep storytelling and emotion (Inside Out).A trip into the mind, across the USA and into what it means to be human A beautifully-wrought, kaleidoscopic journey through the imaginary geography of the inside of an 11 year old girl's mind. This truly epic journey through time, childhood, the midwest and California and into the bonds that bind us as families as well as subjective beings to our imaginary universes is part philosophical questioning, part emotive storytelling and all incredible cinema.  Having seen this at a press screening at Pixar, i can attest that this is a film unlike any other - spectacular in its range and ambition and meticulously rendered into beautiful frames via an unforgettable narrative. It will likely change the way you think about the reality you inhabit your own head, and the way you travel through time as a child, parent or cat. I left the screening almost in tears - struck dumb and a little altered by the way in which the moving image can create such lasting, resonant memories in the mind of the cinema goer.Loved This Movie Inside And Out Inside Out was an animated triumph that will be forever timeless. Pixar has done it again and created yet another animated classic. In this movie we all experience a little fear, a little sadness, a little anger, a little disgust, and of course a little joy. Joy (Amy Poehler) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) take the helm as the leads in one of Pixar's best. This review is such a hard review to write because everything about this movie was so intricate; so detailed that if I reveal much about the plot, it could give away the entire movie. I will say however that this is one of Pixar's most well thought out movies and that it will influence audiences to come back again and again; this time catching something they didn't the first time. All in all, the movie was definitely what it was advertised to be, an emotional roller coaster that the entire family will enjoy. It was the definition of a Pixar movie!Watch your emotions become emotional... This film is a wonder: it is a visual feast, its story is multi-layered yet focused and relatable, and it brings so many ideas that truly work best in the art form (not genre!) of animation. It has become my personal favorite film from Pete Doctor, and it is easily the best film from Pixar since Toy Story 3 or Up. Inside Out hits all the marks: strong creative visuals, interesting characters, an enthralling story and a level of depth and understanding of human emotion that really brings a lot of your own personal connections and thoughts onto the surface. After viewing the film I couldn't stop thinking how effective and educational the story is about understanding how we all operate day-to-day, dealing with each moment and event and how our emotions influence our actions. The film has a number of qualities, for instance, it works just as well as a coming- of-age film, as it does an adventure film, and in a sense, a team or workplace film with the office setting being inside the mind. It makes complete sense that the project comes from and is led by Pete Doctor (with the help of co-director‚Äî and my favorite Pixar story artist‚Äî Ronnie del Carmen). He is able to breathe new life into Pixar with these new characters, bringing the studio back on track, and pushing it in new ways of storytelling. He handles the strong emotional aspects that film depict so well, such as joy (literally, the character Joy!), sentimentality, drama, and so on with the utmost care. Pete and his team are able to inject a great sense of honesty and purity into the film, which you begin as an outsider viewer, and you then become a participant and connect with the story with each beat. After our SIFF screening‚Äî during the Q&amp;A with Peter Doctor and producer Jonas Rivera‚Äî Pete talks a bit of how this film truly utilizes the strengths and advantages of animation for telling a story like this. I completely agree as watching the film, I just kept thinking of other ways this story and its emotional connections can be done. (And with respect to "Herman's Head", which I did watch and love as a kid!) I realized that true emotions are raw, and they are just expressionistic to its core. We all have our own interpretations of our own emotions ‚Äî as well as others‚Äî and it's a challenge trying to visually represent all that universally. Animation uses caricature, exaggerated movement, and specific pacing and shot design in unique ways that allows for ideas like Inside Out to work so well. While we're given the visuals, the sound, and the story, animation is still able to provide a bit of leeway that other film art forms cannot. Animation allows the audience to interact with the story in a unique way: with imagination. Seeing a caricature and the visual design of an element in the film allows us to make our own connections, and that creates a better understanding of what that element is and what it represents (example: Joy's character design and her poses mimic a bright shining star, and these techniques carry-on to the other emotion characters). And it's because of qualities like this that helps us connect to the characters and the events on-screen so well‚Äî to the point that our own feelings start to peek through and we create that emotional bridge.Pixar has done it again! Best movie I've seen this year, so far! Easily! I've been anxiously waiting for this movie since I first heard about it, in August 2013. I attended an event where a clip was shown and I was immediately hooked. So, even though "Inside Out" comes out in the U.S. on June 19, I was able to see an advance screening this week! And it did not disappoint me! The premise of the movie is to "meet the little voices inside your head", which I find interesting per se, especially since we are talking about an animated movie. So we are introduced to Riley: a 11-year-old girl from Minnesota who has to move to San Francisco with her family. How does Riley feel about that? Well, her emotions tell us! We meet Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler), Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith), Anger (voiced by Lewis Black), Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) and Disgust (voiced by Mindy Kaling). They stay in the brain's "headquarters", and they control every reaction Riley has thorough the day and organize her memories when she goes to sleep. Joy tries to take control over almost everything and doesn't let the other emotions in charge, especially Sadness. So, when Sadness touches a hardcore joyful memory and turns it into a sad one, things start to get a little messy inside Riley's head. Joy tries to fix it, but she and Sadness end up being transported out of the headquarters and into the other parts of Riley's brain, so the girl is left only with Anger, Disgust and Fear. The movie is brilliant across the board: the script is original, the casting is perfect (Lewis Black really is the personification of Anger), the running time is adequate, the animation is beautiful, etc. It was a really smart move to show only 5 emotions, even though we have many more. It makes it simpler and smoother to watch. There is one thing about the script that worries me is how it's going to be translated into other languages. What makes it brilliant is the number of words and expressions they play with, like "train of thought": they put an actual train inside her head. This expression, however, is not the same in Portuguese, for example. So I believe the movie will lose a little bit when it gets translated, but it's still extremely good. Like most Pixar movies, it has a very strong connection to adult audiences, so probably children won't get all the jokes and references, but their parents certainly will. It also shows us, beautifully, how we shouldn't try to suppress any emotion, because every moment in our lives consist of different emotions and all those experiences shape us. This may seem obvious to adults, but it's good to show it to children, who are the demographic Pixar is aiming. But adults can certainly enjoy the way it's portrait. This will probably be a big success for Pixar and it got outstanding reviews during the Cannes Festival last month. This is certainly good for the studio, since it had lost its touch in the last movies (don't get me started on "Brave" and "Cars 2"¬Ö). The problems inside Pixar were evident last year, when the studio decided not to release "The Good Dinosaur" due to script problems. So 2015 will be the first year we'll have two Pixar movies.

Roll the film... Pixar has not come out with an original film for quite some time. Brave was more of a Disney princess film, while Inside Out looks to introduce us to a fresh new world. How will it stand up to their catalogue of brilliant films?  Kid's Korner rating: 4.25 stars Parent's Rating: 4.25 stars It is not easy to understand the emotions of children, but what if you were able to see their emotions being played out on the big screen? Directors Pete Docter (UP) and Ronaldo Del Carmen's new film Inside Out allows us to see into the turbulent, but humorous world of the pre-teen emotional landscape. Riley the focus of this emotional tale and she is going through a multitude of changes in her life. Things get even more challenging when her family moves from the Minnesota to San Francisco. As she is growing older, these new situations reek havoc on the emotional battlefield of Riley and her family. Over the initial days of their arrival to their new home and school, her emotions, Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith), who live in Riley's 'Headquarters', try to navigate her through the emotional mine field of the past and present. Then an emotional catastrophe leads to the mixing of her emotions, her memories and her responses to life which have the potential to lead to significant, life changing results.  In raising three daughters who have experienced similar stages of life as Riley, this flurry of emotions came alive on screen in a hilarious, but personal way. The story felt simplistic and child-like, which made sense because these are the emotions of a pre- teenager. They are not mature characters, but the 'emotions' are growing at the same rate as the child they exist within. This is explained in finer detail by seeing the emotional landscape of Riley's parents. They contain similar characters, but with they exist with a depth that has not occurred yet in Riley's life. Inside Out is such a different experience than most animated films and it is handled with a similarly mature fashion as UP. This style of storytelling causes a shift in understanding of what it was trying convey, which ultimately was the maturing of a young girl into adulthood. Which would suggest that anyone should not go into this film expecting a typical Disney film. Without sounding too obvious, this film will play on your emotions and may cause you to consider all you have forgotten, the many things that have influenced your life and how joyful emotions are maybe even sweeter when mixed with a bit of sadness. Our family really enjoyed this film, but had to take the time to consider what it all meant to us and what it will mean for our youngest child in the future.  The writing and directing of the lead characters of the film bring in the needed qualities of the Pixar films we have come to love over the years. It is funny and well written which caused laugh out loud moments, potential times of fear and a multitude of tears throughout the theatre. In the same vein as UP, the themes were meant for the tween to adult audience, but it still can be enjoyed by younger children. The younger set may need some explanations of the deeper emotional elements on screen. Inside Out falls squarely in the middle of the pack of the Pixar quality productions, not the best film, but still an excellent film that delivers a joyful experience for the family. Dad asked the question on the ride home, 'What did I think of the film?' I felt all of those emotions while watching this movie. I really liked the film even more after we talked about it afterwards. It was funny and I really like the Bing Bong (Richard Kind) character. He was funny and sad at the same time. Talking with Dad, I thought Inside Out was really good.

Kid's Korner are reviews written by Russell Matthews' with his kid's perspective and based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews #insideoutA roller-coaster of 'emotions' Inside out was one of my most anticipated movies of the year and it definitely did not disappoint. This movie was a roller-coaster of emotions the whole way through. It sends you from happy right down to sad and a little teary really quickly and then manages to get you laughing again within a few minutes, and to be able to pull that off is incredible. Lets start with those characters - the emotions, all of the emotions were very funny in their own unique way and seeing them all interact and clash made for many hilarious moments. They were most definitely the highlight of the film and rightfully so take up most of the screen time. I honestly cannot pick a favourite because they were all so different and so damn good. The voice acting performances were just do great and they all sounded exactly the way you think they would just by looking at them. Even when they switch over to the human perspective you still get great characters in the form of Riley, and her mum and dad to keep you entertained. Also the plot was great, it didn't slow down that much at all and was hilariously entertaining, it all made sense and offered many new and original plot points to keep you constantly interested.  The only issue i had and a very minor one was that there were a few very short patches where the film was beginning to lose my interest a little but it very quickly got back on track and had me laughing again. In the end this was a fantastic film that has plenty of laughs for both the kids and adults, and also prepare to find yourself getting a little teary throughout the film, as it really is in fact a roller-coaster of emotion. - 9.2Pixar has done it again Let me just throw this out there: Inside Out is easily the best Pixar film in years. Inside Out is not just the best in the last few years, but it will without a doubt stand alongside the best of the best the studio has to offer. It's a really tough thing to rank Pixar, because they have had such stellar track record, and so it really boils down to which animated masterpiece is your favorite. Do you love the nostalgia of the original Toy Story, or how about how Finding Nemo swept us away? We can argue The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E and Up are the best that Pixar has to offer...Inside Out is going to further complicate that favorite status for a lot of people. Inside Out is about a little girl named Riley, and the story takes place during a time when her family makes a great move from her Minnesota home town to San Francisco. For anyone who has ever moved at a young age, they may recall emotional hurdles trying to adjust to living in a new home, new location, a new school and making new friends. It can be a lot to ask for to a child. That is what this movie is about, and Pixar tells this story on parallel planes both from Riley's humanistic world and the very emotions that exist within her head. Riley's brain is bonkers. Never have I expected to see such surrealistic imaginative settings for a Pixar film. Unlike every film the studio has made to date, Inside Out creates a slate that breaks all logical boundaries. We are talking about a world that is as vast as your very own imagination, and Pixar takes full advantage of that by making truly out-there and brilliant possibilities. Inside Out is a movie about emotions, and it would not be a success if the movie itself did not feel emotional. This is probably the most emotional Pixar film to date, but as a roller coaster that goes through its highs and lows, and it makes sure you are along for the ride. At the end of the day, once you see the full picture of Inside Out you will understand the true context and all the metaphors toward life it has to share. This is easily the most complex and layered Pixar film to date, and in a way it sets a new bar for Pixar's maturity at telling captivating stories that anyone can relate to no matter what the age is.Unique in a terrible way. Inside out shows the struggles of a child moving house. It tells to never loose hope. Now you may think this is a very simple story and good but it's more complicated than you think. Most of the movie is about these two characters joy and sadness trying to get back into the kids brain. Literally. This movie is way too complicated for what it is and it could have been really simple. Actually, I think they could have made the movie better without the cartoon characters: joy, sadness, angry, and whatever the rest are. Oh and also this movie is no fun at all. There are no laughs until the credits and I don't think kids would really like this at all. They were laughing tonnes when the minions trailer came on before the movie and when I came out of the movie all I saw was kids crying. I would really think twice before seeing this one. Congratulations Disney you have ruined another movie that could have been great. What happened to the times when you made Finding Nemo, The incredibles.Pixar's Brilliance Restored! After the not-as-brilliant Cars 2, Brave and Monsters University, Pixar has really captured the emotion felt within films like Up, Monsters Inc, Toy Story films, etc, in Inside Out! Today, I got to go to an Inside Access early screening of the film, and I loved it! This film has a great balance of characters that you care about, a simple yet complex story on both sides of the humans connecting to the personified emotions, and overall a really creative and super unique concept that has some real emotional weight to it!  Even though there were some pretty silly parts to it, it really worked with the film. The idea was super unique and played out better than I expected it to, because from the trailers there was not much other than an idea put forth. But the plot introduced and the brilliance of thought put behind the characters was tied together beautifully. There were no big cheesy storytelling clich√©s or easy ways out of problems, nor was there any unnatural dialogue or characters; overall everything seemed to connect for the greater good of working towards the pure emotion felt at the end and throughout. It worked amazingly.  There were times that things got a bit silly and seemed to only be there to serve as a joke, and where I'm fine with that it got a tiny bit too much in the middle there. And sometimes a joke would be repeated too much, but hey, there was nothing that took away too much from the story. I'm glad this unique idea took something further than the last 3 movies Pixar has done, and made you feel for the characters in a creative way. Whereas I didn't dislike the last 3 Pixar movies as much as some may have, I still believe this was a massive improvement and has brought the bar back up to the creativity unlocked in early years at Pixar.  Go see this movie, because it is gives you some of the amazing old Pixar we love with a really innovative idea, that is all tied together with interesting characters and heartfelt moments that everybody will love! 9/10. -1 for bits of cheesy moments and not quite reaching the perfect level some Pixar movies have obtained.  That's all. -Braden &lt;3A culmination of an animation studio's two decades of sheer brilliance Pixar's "Inside Out" may be the most heartfelt and morally honest film the renowned animated studio has made in their now two decades of operation. This film is an all-encompassing testament to the animated studio's ability to please audiences of all ages, innovate new designs and atmospheres to their already immaculately detailed environments, explore uncharted realms in the field, and give people a film that seriously makes them look at themselves introspectively. This is more than a film people, kids and parents, will want to see, but a film they will need to see. This is a film that's far easier to watch than it is to explain. We are greeted with Riley Anderson (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), a spunky eleven-year-old who loves hockey but is undergoing a move from Minnesota to San Francisco that will drastically change her life. She'll have to make new friends, adjust to a new environment, and really attempt to fit in, as she's entering a very tumultuous time in life. This will obviously cause an emotional roller-coaster for her, which is why we spend most of our time inside Riley's mind, where we meet her emotions. Joy (Amy Poehler) is her most prominent emotion, commanding the headquarters of Riley's mind so that she is the happy, cheerful little girl we always see. Riley's supporting emotions are Sadness (Phyllis), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling), all of whom chiming in at one point or another, but with Joy frequently commanding the ride. However, when Sadness causes a serious accident, resulting in the loss of Riley's core memories, Sadness and Joy, along with the core memories, are subsequently sucked into the subconscious mind of Riley. Here, Riley cannot access her memories of Sadness and Joy, nor her core memories, leaving her with the inability to express any emotion besides fear, anger, and disgust. As a result, Sadness and Joy must work their way back to the headquarters of Riley's mind, a task that need be completed soon or every defining asset of Riley cherishes, be it hockey, her family, or her goofy side, will crumble, leaving her an empty shell of a human with the inability to feel. As a reminder, "Inside Out" is not nearly this confusing to follow. In fact, it's rather amazing how writer/director Pete Docter ("Monster's Inc," "Up") and the remaining screen writing team of Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley make this film so easily accessible to kids. Kids will instantly recognize the playfulness of the emotions controlling Riley's mind, and, presumably as a result, consider how their own emotions impact them on a daily basis. The incredible cast of voice actors shouldn't go unnoticed, as they're essentially playing the bare basics of characters by predicating themselves on one core emotion. However, surprisingly so, one of the most memorable and heartfelt characters isn't an emotion, but Bing Bong (Richard Kind), Riley's imaginary friend who guides Sadness and Joy through the different depths of Riley's mind. Kind voices Bing Bong with a potent sense of happiness and sadness, making him one of the most sympathetic animated characters in recent memories. As Poehler describes him in a Q&amp;A, his character is like a vaudeville actor pining to prove himself during one last performance. It's redundant to continue to praise Pixar's exquisitely detailed visual effects, so let's focus on the meatier aspects of "Inside Out," like its emotional relevance with its audience. This is the very definition of a crowdpleasing film. We can all recall a time when our emotions got the best of us and we said things we didn't mean, or recall when our emotions were so indescribable we could barely think straight. It also houses the valuable lesson that, in order for a mind to fully operate, every emotion must play a part (a rude but necessary awakening for Joy). "Inside Out" makes you imagine this sort of scenario going on in your own head by not only focusing on Riley's mind but flawlessly segwaying the story to show how the minds of others work (the scene during the end credits is comedic gold in terms of carrying this idea to the fullest). Furthermore, so many elements had to be considered for this kind of film, such as portraying the emotions of the five main emotions, as well as making their personalities likable despite the emotions they're representing. Docter, LeFauve, and Cooley handle this in an incredibly dignified manner. The only thing burdening "Inside Out," ultimately, is its lack of emotional subtlety. When you're making a motion picture revolving so blatantly around emotions (or, as the tagline cleverly puts it, a "major emotion picture"), you're going to have a film that leaves few emotions unexploited. With "Inside Out," while it doesn't crank up the mawkishness to cloying levels, it does inevitably leave the film dictating your own emotions while you watch the film. Yet, this isn't as big of a problem as it should be, mainly because rather than amplifying pathos, the trio of writers are more compelled with trying to craft an innovative and unique movie-going/moviewatching experience for the audience, which is evident with nearly every frame in the film. "Inside Out" is a culmination of a craft Pixar has held for two decades, which have been filled with ostensibly everything active imaginations and incorruptible creativity can conjure up. The fact that they'll likely continue down this path, despite ostensibly making one idea that's better than the next, is something that will almost always leave me excited.Manages to be complex and smart while still fun and charming Inside Out is Pixar at its best. It's an engaging idea that takes on pretty complex subjects and turn them into a fun ride without dumbing them down, but actually subverting them into humorous situations (and of course there's the heartfelt and tear inducing moments we came to expect from the studio's features). In the film's world, every person has inside their minds 5 emotions: sadness, joy, anger, disgust and fear. Each with its own personality and desires. They also habit the "world of the mind": there's the cave of the uncunscious, the islands that defines our personality, a fantasy world and etc. The creativity put into this film is so great it reaches both adults and kids without having to recur to subtle profanity to get adults wry smiling or pushing an overly cute character to get smaller children giggling. The five emotions that live inside the girl Riley have to deal with everything she goes through in life, but these things assume other forms inside her mind and its so curious and exciting just seeing how her memories, desires, relationships, nightmares, expectations and all kind of experiences take shape in this inner world and are dealt with. What truly makes Inside Out a great movie is the amount of subtlety in each situation and character. For example, the fact that Joy is yellow but also has blue hair (the color of sad). The way it shows us that each emotion is essential and part of life and how the whole time they interact with each other making our existence confusing but at the same time so rich and complex. The movie wittily materializes and personifies things that goes inside us that we may find sometimes hard to explain and gives us a whole new and imaginative view on how we feel and think - and it does that with remarkable simplicity and inventiveness. Inside Out will probably have a sequel (maybe more) and that's a great thing in this case, because the whole idea is so intriguing and full of possibilities. After seeing this film you may actually start imagining these characters rambling in your mind and talking over each other.In the Top-Tier of Pixar's Already Stunning List of Features The buzz has been huge for Pixar's latest venture about the mind of a little girl and the emotions that live within her. Writer/directors Pete Docter and Ronaldo del Carmen, along with co-scribes Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley create a film with the most simple and authentic concept, and turns it into a methodical, moving, and layered story with so many different themes to indulge. Though there is a minor element to the film that leaves you a bit cold, "Inside Out" is clearly successful in its approach and just about everything you want in a family film this time of year. "Inside Out" tells the story of Riley, an eleven-year-old girl whose family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. In her mind live five real, and relatable feelings: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. When Joy and Sadness accidentally are thrown into the land of Riley's long-term memories, Riley undergoes a barrage of emotions that are affecting her relationships with family, friends, and the things she loves. Now, Joy and Sadness must get back to her core command in order to restore Riley's feelings and relationships. Teamed with the voice talents of Amy Poehler ( who plays "Joy"), Phyllis Smith (who plays "Sadness"), Bill Hader (who plays "Fear"), Lewis Black (who plays "Anger"), and Mindy Kaling (who plays "Disgust"), Pixar's joyful and moving animated feature presents equal parts of humor and tears. A fascinating deconstruction of the mind of a child, and the changes they endure along the way. The subject matter is among Pixar's most ambitious and their most impressive since "WALL-E." What shines bright is the stunning animation on screen. A beautiful array of colors, just hypnotizing to the eyes as "Joy" and "Sadness" venture off into different parts of Riley's mind. I'd say this is definitely among Pixar's most alluring and aesthetically beautiful films they've ever created. As we've come to expect from an Oscar-winning composer like Michael Giacchino, the score for "Inside Out" is subtly impeccable. Among his most reserved compositions, Giacchino takes a back seat to the story and lets the film do its work through imagery and narration. Presenting another key reason for a Voice Work Oscar to be created, both Poehler and Smith are downright magnificent in two of the year's finest performances. Poehler's Joy anchors the film with a glaze of sweetness, and when called upon, will break your heart with epic emotions. Smith's Sadness is a devastating but truly compelling creation, as she bridges our thoughts through tears and loss. Those two will be putting your tearducts to work and in overdrive in several moments. This is another shining example of a female-driven feature that is just as enjoyable, if not more, than any other male protagonist in films today. Film producers need to start taking notice of the slate of successes this year and what they need to do change the landscape. Where the film doesn't completely connect is in its supporting characters, in particular Anger and Disgust. With no fault going to the sensational voice work of Lewis Black and Mindy Kaling, the narrative creation of their place in the story doesn't seem to quite jive. "Anger" is a simple emotion to portray, but I minor found inconsistencies in his character's actions that were noticeable. "Disgust," which probably would have been better off being called "Sarcasm" just didn't seem like a core emotion that I think exists in the mind of an eleven year old girl. While I think "Disgust" is something that the younger minds can easily understand, I think a different direction may have been needed for her inclusion. Other players like Bill Hader, Diane Lane (who plays Mom), and Kyle MacLachlan (who plays Dad) are strongly assembled. Special shout out to Kaitlyn Dias, who voices Riley, is vivaciously real in each delivery and each line. With no shortage of tears for the adults, and big laughs for the kids, "Inside Out" fits firmly in the top-tier of Pixar's most vibrant pictures. An echo of love and vulnerability, the feature is gorgeously inventive and passionately executed. A fine selection for all to enjoy, no matter what age. Your frontrunner for the Animated Feature Oscar for 2015 has arrived. In addition, the Pixar short "Lava" is stunningly delightful and powerfully engaging. Likely another contender for an Animated Short Academy Award. Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)One the best films I've seen this year! Welcome back, Pixar! Last year we didn't get a Pixar movie, and the year before that, the only thing they gave us the fans was that easily forgettable "Monsters University," so it's good to see Pixar returning, full force, with this latest masterpiece, INSIDE OUT, which reminds us of how good Pixar is when they make well-written, well thought-out heartfelt original stories instead of sequels. INSIDE OUT is one of the best movies I've seen this year and I hope it would ultimately be a potential Oscar contender come award season because it deserves all the success. The way to describe Pixar's INSIDE OUT without wording it too much is that basically the minute you sit in that theater's seat to watch this movie, you're practically enrolled in Pixar's study of adolescent psychology 101. But I can assure, it's more fun than your regular boring class lectures. Co-directed by the man behind my #1 all-time favorite Pixar movie, "Up," Oscar-winning filmmaker Pete Docter and along with Ronaldo Del Carmen and scribes Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, they crafted this elaborate, engaging and entertaining story that essentially could help parents everywhere who suddenly have to face the fact that their kids are no longer the little adorable kids they once knew; that stage between childhood and teenage years without necessarily going into the teenage years because Pixar is not in the business of doing horror movies. All joking aside, this movie wants to explain, in a very Pixar way, how young ones may resist change but that change is ultimately something to be accepted, and the emotions they go through in order to deal with that change. INSIDE OUT introduces 5 different emotions and present them in five very eccentric characters: Joy, anger, sadness, disgust, and fear. I'm not sure how many emotions we humans biologically have but Pixar settles on these five. And each of them is very into who they are, for example, fear would extremely be afraid at all times and joy can be so optimistic that she sounds annoying, makes you want to just punch her and tell her to shut the hell up. These five emotions live to serve a little girl named Riley who had a beautiful childhood, evidenced by her many fun and loving memories. Her childhood is every kid's envy, not that her family is rich but that her parents and friends were always there for her, and she loved her school, her neighborhood, her town. Until the day when Riley's family has to move to San Francisco and it's a completely drastic change for Riley. Joy is somewhat of the leader of this emotion command control, the rest would look up to her when they don't know what to do or when they don't know which emotion Riley should be feeling. And in Joy's mind, Riley should literally always be up and happy all the times. And that's when sadness comes in and feels compelled to touch the core memories. Long story short, without spoiling any critical plot points. Joy and Sadness end up by themselves, separated from the others, and away from the control room, so they have to find their way back and it's not an easy journey. The concept itself is brilliant, Pete and his filmmaking team created these 'Islands' to represent certain aspects that we humans may be surrounded with as a child: friendship, family, the ability to be goofy. But as we grow up, those islands will crumble. In their journey back, Joy and Sadness encounter imagination character named Bing Bong and at first when I watched the movie, I thought Bing Bong was going to be the antagonist, but there's not really an antagonist in this story. Even these emotions themselves, just like Riley, would have to learn that things aren't always going to stay the same forever. The animation is Pixar's most pristine work yet. The moment Riley was born, the emotions miraculously existed and their hair and body look like they're made up of some sort of sparkling floating firefly lights of blue, green, yellow, red, and purple, like you want to get close and just examine them in details. Pete Docter was very smart to have cast this amazing group of funny people to voice these emotions. Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Bill Hader as Fear, Mindy Kaling as disgust, and the legendary Lewis Black as Anger. I mean c'mon here, all these guys are practically born to voice these particular emotions, especially Lewis Black who's spent most his career being labeled the angry comedian, that's how he banks his humor. The stars are aligned for INSIDE OUT. The tone is what you'd expect in a Pixar movie, a mix of fun, thrill, adventure and moments that can make you cry, but it's a healthy cry, composer Michael Giacchino's music knows which buttons to push to get those tears flowing. I don't think INSIDE OUT means to tell parents that this is what you should or shouldn't do. It's simply an illustration, Pixar-style, describing that change is inevitable, it's part of growing up, but if you'll be there for your loved ones and just listen to them, they'll invite you to be part of that change and that's family moving forward.A wonderful adventure where Riley's emotions, masters of everyday life, face challenges that affect her coming of age after her parents uproot her. "Inside out" is, in my humble opinion the best movie Pixar has ever made. As an animation studio, they have managed to set themselves apart with beautiful heartfelt stories that continue down the line of Walt Disney's masterpieces. Here we see five predominant emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger, as characters inside a little girl's head. From her birth, we follow the emotions on how they make us do what we do. Get mad, laugh, cry, even how we dream. Every single aspect of our mind is depicted in colorful well thought of places and characters. From the "subconcious prison" to "imagination land"; light bulbs to plug in for ideas, memories getting stored in shelves or even the train of thought that runs through our heads. "Inside out" has achieved everything. It is both an adventure and a coming of age story where the humans are not as close to us as the little people inside our head are, but they are still so real. The movie will make you feel both nostalgia and joy as you watch your emotions and memories pass by on the screen. It's about acceptance, and makes us see sense in how we evolve towards adulthood. Here, your mind is a town full of complex mechanisms that somehow make sense if we picture it inside our heads. Pixar has made another masterpiece, but this time it isn't it's characters or its story you will remember, it's the universe and its morality, the great lesson you take into account about your emotions and yourself. You will laugh, cry and feel as if no other film or cartoon has ever showed who we are and how we work as humans better than "Inside out". One you have seen it, you will no doubt carry on with your daily life imagining your emotions running around inside your head.Pixar is back Inside out is directed by Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen, starring Amy Pohler, Bill hader, Lewis Black. First off, inside out is one of Pixar's best films ever made. This is one of Pixar's most original ideas and they made everything so prefect, the movies is for all ages. Kids and parents will love this and for the kids it will teach them an important message about yourself. The story follows Riley and her emotions, Joy, Fear, Anger, disgust, and sadness. Thought the movie you see Riley have lots of emotions on moving to a different city, school, and many more things. The voice acting is great by everyone, Amy Pohler does a great job as joy and Lewis Black as Anger is just amazing casting. What made inside out an amazing movie was that it was about emotions and it managed to make you feel so many emotions though out the whole movie. Overall Inside out is a fun, touching movie with lots of depth to everything. Great for all ages. Definitely inside out is up there with the incredibles, toy story, and finding nemo.Inside Out Puts Pixar Back On Top! Inside Out has really put Pixar back at the top of it's game. It is the company's best movie in years, since Toy Story 3. It follows the 5 main emotions, Joy, Disgust, Anger, Fear and Sadness, inside a little girl named Riley's head as they navigate her through various obstacles, i.e. life. The emotions really dictate the film, and carry it through, making way for scenes where each gets to shine in enjoyable and touching moments. The voices Riley hears inside her head are lent by some of the best funny people currently out there. This really is an all star cast: Mindy Kaling is a perfect diva as Disgust, Bill Hader is hilariously panic stricken as Fear, Lewis Black is his hotheaded self, yelling out as Anger, Amy Poehler is a complete and honest Joy and Phyllis Smith creates the most brilliant shade of blue as Sadness. Rounding out the cast is another great performance from Richard Kind, as well as a few incredible cameos that you may not recognize until the end credits. This dynamic grouping creates some of the best chemistry a Pixar movie has seen. The story starts out slow and light and fluffy, with brightly saturated colors and lots of pep and love and great humor. But don't let that fool you. As you grow closer to these characters and what they symbolize, your heart will be tugged on more than one occasion. Take the opening sequence of Up, with it's thorough storytelling through simple imagery that gives just enough information for the moment, and scatter moments like that all throughout the movie. Inside Out is actually written very cleverly. It allows a film that is skewed towards very young audience members to hit a heavy subject and possibly uncomfortable themes, but not in too much of a frightening way. The film is also clever in its theory and philosophy. The idea of how emotions and thoughts and imagination works and how they all interact and coexist with each other in a world within our brain is fun. How all of those instances and internal interactions effect us outwardly is also important, and could be something very hard to get a handle on. Here, Pixar manages to create a solid foundation for all of this, while still being able to actually remain abstract enough to allow for almost anything to happen. And it all happens to a brilliant mood swing of a soundtrack by Michael Giacchino. Everything presented here is completely accessible and relatable, on both a large general scale as well as one small and personal. Kids and adults will both be able to understand and sympathize with these characters, and what goes on inside and outside of our heads. We all go though life in this way, whether we have realized it before now or not. But seeing how it actually plays out and the thought process behind it is an absolute wonder. It's a hockey puck that Pixar knocks right into the goal.Inside Out Tells Us Why Pixar is The Best Pixar makes great movies. I know they made Cars 2 but hey everyone makes mistakes. I just came back after watching Inside Out and I am thrilled.  "Inside out is one of the most innovative and best films made my Pixar" I was intrigued by the trailers because it touched me and the film is so much better than the trailers. Trailers make it seem complicated, but the film is not that much difficult to grasp. Kids are going to enjoy this. It might become my favorite Pixar movie ever, but I will have to watch it 5-6 times to decide if it is really that good. The concept was really good, but I was skeptical about the screenplay as it is not easy to put a subject like this into words. I must say that they have worked really hard on this film and the best thing is that the hard work paid off. The writing is sharp and witty. There are scenes of sadness and fun and you won't feel like you are missing something. It touches you because everyone has felt these kinds of emotions, no matter what their age is. There are some big LOL moments that will make you laugh out loud and there are some scenes that will make your feel sad. So you can be pretty sure that it has everything a movie needs. All the characters are lovable. The animation is breathtaking and wonderful as other Pixar movies. Inside Out is a film without a great message. I kept thinking about it for a long time. It made me remember my childhood. I used to have the same kind of emotions that I couldn't explain. I cried when the movie ended. Inside Out will appeal to both the young and adult audiences. It will definitely put Pixar on top again as it is getting rave reviews. This is the Pixar that we love and appreciate. So, I can easily say that Pixar has done it again. Pixar has delivered a masterpiece.Boasts a nearly nonstop onslaught of mindboggling creativity. The creativity runs rampant in Pixar's "Inside Out," producing brilliant representations of universal notions, given life through brightly colored, exceptionally perceptive (and personable) animations. Though infinitely inventive, "Inside Out" ironically (and arguably) doesn't generate quite the same level of heartfelt emotion found in Pixar's very best (the most sympathetic entity in this film just might be an imaginary one). But the screen time is shrewdly split amongst numerous characters of varied and magnified attributes, as well as between two separated, parallel story lines - for a keenly cinematic balancing act of insight and understanding. When Riley Anderson was born, the emotion Joy (Amy Poehler) stood alone in the "headquarters" of her mind. But soon, other emotions appeared, including Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), and Anger (Lewis Black). As Riley aged, Joy and the other emotions learned to work together to bring balance to both her memories and the branching islands of the young girl's personality. At age eleven, Riley's life is uprooted by a family move from their Minnesotan hometown to a drab apartment building in San Francisco - prompting her emotions to work overtime to alleviate the situation. While governing ‚Äì then quarreling over ‚Äì a disastrous episode on the first day of school, Joy and Sadness are accidentally transported to the outer regions of Riley's long-term memory, forcing the duo to attempt a perilous journey across the expanses of her mazelike mind in order to return to the command center before the other emotions lead the dispirited girl permanently astray. "Inside Out" boasts a nearly nonstop onslaught of mindboggling creativity ‚Äì all while cartoonishly visualizing the relatable traumas of normal childhood. In many ways, it approaches the human mind like Woody Allen does in his reflective ensembles, filled with overabundant negative emotions that make simple enjoyment a rather difficult undertaking - spiraling down into a rabbit hole of neurotic, frenetic, vivid concoctions. The endlessly fascinating concepts may borrow a thing or two from "Minority Report," "Despicable Me," the "Little Big Planet" video games, and Rube Goldberg, but just tackling fleeting notions of brain freezes, dreams, fading memories, abstract thoughts, the subconscious, and the fear of clowns is absolutely inspired. The whole picture is routinely smile-inducing, crafting the perfect blend of comedy, action, and sentimentality, as Pixar is widely known for. It's also smartly aimed at adults as much as children - or even more so, as evidenced by a witty reference to "Chinatown" that kids will definitely miss. And, refusing to skimp on any aspect, the music is once again sensationally composed by Pixar regular Michael Giacchino, who has a way with striking up unforgettable tunes. As an intuitive exploration of maturation and the complexities of the mind, "Inside Out" is staggeringly artistic; and as a feel-good, family-friendly misadventure stocked with moral and emotional revelations, it's a visionary piece of grand entertainment. Pixar has always been a studio to set the bar high, and "Inside Out" does not disappoint.  The Massie Twins A must-see for parents and kids alike There's a reason Disney/Pixar dominates the critical and commercial market. They are on an incredible run of heart-warming, imaginative, funny, intelligent, and gorgeously animated films. Inside Out is no exception as it attempts to illustrate the trials and tribulations of navigating through childhood. The story centers around A young girl named Riley, who up until this point has had her childhood memories, thoughts and personality controlled by Joy (one of a handful of emotions brought to life as creatures living inside the child's mind). This all begins to change after Riley is forced to move home, and the stresses of her and her family's new life mean Joy is struggling to keep control over Riley's life as Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear begin to take over. As with many Disney/Pixar films that try to cater to a wide range of audiences, Inside Out can sometimes feel like about five films in one. However, Pete Docter and his writing team have created such a well rounded screenplay brought to life wonderfully and enthusiastically by a talented voice cast that it all comes together to create a wonderful movie with bucket loads of heart. I took my 4 year old daughter, and while there was a enough humour and action to keep her interested - the sweet spot for children is within 8-12 years old to get the maximum out of the emotions, story, and relativity. As always, look out for the beautiful Pixar short-movie, 'Lava' to kick-off the experience.Yet another Pixar masterpiece Greetings again from the darkness. Once upon a time ¬Ö in 1995 to be exact ¬Ö Pixar revitalized and revolutionized the world of animated movies with the release of the first Toy Story. In the process, they sent our expectations soaring for each of their subsequent movies. Despite the pressure of such high standards, the creative geniuses at the studio have regularly thrilled and delighted us over the years with classics such as Cars (2006), Ratatouille (2007), Wall-E (2008), and Brave (2012). And beyond these, there have been a few true cinematic masterpieces ‚Äì transcendent films: Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), Up (2009), and Toy Story 3 (2010). This most recent release unquestionably belongs in the latter group ¬Ö it's one for the ages (and all ages). Genius and brilliance could be used to describe all aspects of this movie. It's a technical marvel, a visual kaleidoscope of bright colors across the full screen, and most amazingly, it packs an emotional wallop with real life moments for adolescents and parents alike. My comments will be brief because this is one you should experience for yourself ‚Äì and probably more than once. Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is an 11 year old girl who lives in Minnesota and loves her parents, her friends, and hockey. She is happy and well-adjusted. When the family relocates to San Francisco, broccoli on the pizza is only one of the challenges Riley must face. This change affects everything for her ‚Äì no more friends, no more hockey, and a strained relationship with her parents. At this point, you are probably saying "So what? That's nothing we haven't seen before." And you are correct, except we have never seen it explained the way Pixar does. We literally go behind-the-scenes of Riley's brain and see the control panel of her emotions. There is a constant battle between Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Anger (Lewis Black), and the ring-leader Joy (Amy Poehler). This is an exploration of emotions and memories, and the explanation has some scientific merit. Memories are depicted as marbles, and Riley's favorite things are shown as islands (Sports Island, Friendship Island, etc). How emotions affect memories is the key point here, and especially how sadness is necessary and vital to our joy. Have you wondered why we forget our imaginary childhood friends (Riley's is Bing Bong, voiced by Richard Kind)? Have you wondered why our memories change over time, and are impacted by our emotional state in any given moment? This animated gem will help you understand. Director Pete Docter (the genius behind Up) has a daughter of his own, and he clearly "gets" the emotional changes brought on during the pre-teen years. His research, and that of co-director Ronaldo Del Carmen, takes us on an adventure that should inspire much conversation between parents and kids. And even if it somehow doesn't break the ice in every family, it will at a minimum help youngsters and parents better understand the link between emotions and memories ¬Ö plus, they will probably share a good cry and a bunch of laughs along the way. Hats off (again) to the Pixar geniuses. I dare you to top this one! ***NOTE: you should also look forward to another Pixar tradition ‚Äì the pre-movie short film. This one is a very unique short entitled Lava.Best Movie of 2015 So Far!!! To break down Inside Out is to break down the mind and all of its beautiful complexities. While the idea of characterizing the emotions of the human is not exactly original (look up the short play "Bob's Date") PIXAR tackles it in a very original way. The organization of the mind may seem simple at first in this film, but we see through the amazing digital set designs in Inside Out that the mind is highly complex, and its various parts or sections are very dependent on each other. I am not saying we did not know the mind is complex, but the film illustrates the mind with an original layout while letting the audience know it is still complex. While the focus is highly on how the emotions control the person, the person herself, Riley, is very crucial to the story. She is a very joyful kid who finds herself moving to a new area with her family in the opening credit sequence. This happens to put Riley, as well as her emotions, through new obstacles, and the protagonist, Joy, struggles to keep Riley happy for the first time in their lives. This leads to an event which separates Joy and Sadness from the headquarters, and Riley's mood becomes similar to depression, though it is never labeled as such but is heavily implied. What the film beautifully illustrates is the idea that when people have crises, the mind itself is having its own crisis to create or add to the external problems - a beautiful correlation between the external and the internal. The primary struggle is between Joy and Sadness, and it starts out as Joy attempting to suppress Sadness as much as possible and moves towards Joy finding worth in Sadness gradually. This relationship moves towards one of the most sentimental scenes in the history of PIXAR, which brought this viewer to tears. Aside from having a great story structure and a great character arc for both Joy and Sadness, Inside Out is hilarious throughout with great running gags and clever moments which give character to aspects of the mind other than the emotions (if you really want to laugh, stay for the footage during the credits, and keep in mind there is nothing AFTER the credits). Dreaming is treated like a movie set - an idea that is supposedly illustrated in Inception if viewers pay enough attention - and Fear becomes a sort of film critic for a brief segment. For the funniest running gag in the film, all I will say is it involves when songs get stuck in the head. This movie cleverly and ironically makes the audience feel the best of joy with its comedy as well as the worst of sadness/sympathy with its sentimental moments. It is simply a must-see film - one of the best PIXAR movies to date, and my favorite to have been directed by Pete Docter!From the Inside Out it is all Pixar We all are victim to our emotions, always susceptible to a tantrum or sobfest that overruled our logical side. The trigger for these outbursts can vary in form, a bad day at school, a breakup with a boyfriend, or in my case sitting through bad movies. Whatever the cause, have you ever stopped to picture what is going on in your mind to cause this? Pixar has, and their latest film has brought those thoughts to life in a way only their studios can. Today I review Inside Out and take a look at what creative sparks lie in their studio.  Pixar has been on the sequel train for quite a while, so I was thirsty for a drink from the original pool. Inside Out emerges from that source we fell in love with years ago, and brings it back ten fold in the world of young Riley's (Kaitlyn Dias) mind. Inside Out is a beautiful personification of the inner workings of the mind, filled with colorful visuals that pop off the screen. A high tech "head"quarters for the cortex looks like something from Star Wars, where futuristic control panels govern all the memories and thoughts that govern our being. Outside command central, Pixar gives you more of their magic in their creations; forming a maze for long term memory, a movie studio as the source of your dreams, and an obvious train for your train of thought. Tacky as some of the puns are, Pixar puts their wit back into the game to design a unique world that is sure to entertain many, as well as become the next theme park attraction.  As the emotions transverse the chaos that is our brain, Pixar not only takes you on a physical adventure but an emotional one as well. Of course being a kids movie there are a lot of comedic moments that had me, as well as other audience members, laughing. Slapstick humor involving bodily harm, one liner puns that will appear in memes, and plenty of witty dialogue that represents the internal struggle of indecisiveness. In particular Anger's (Lewis Black) ranting had me laughing the hardest, as the simplistic yelling and rash threats to curse were to my tastes. Sadness (Phyllis Smith) had to be my second favorite, more so in how she presented her lines with that perfect twist of depression to make it funny, and yet sad at the same time.  Yet while comedy is a big portion of this movie, Pixar/Disney always manages to bring other emotions into the mix. Seeing as one of the emotions is Sadness, you can guess there are a few moments that can bring tears to your eyes as Riley's memories unfold before your eyes. Joy offsets these moments though, with beautifully crafted sequences that cover those special times in life. And all of it is edited together at just the right times to make the emotions hit home, building slight tension, but delivering a satisfying finish. Pixar represents this emotional instability both inside Riley's mind and outside in her actions, really capturing the look and feel of someone troubled, hence the title. It's balanced well with the humor, and gives older audience members a tether to the film to keep their interest.  Voice acting though is the factory that really brings things to life, as each emotion is matched with their voice counterpart. Poehler's optimism shines bright in joy as she rambles off her ideas to keep Riley happy, and you can feel the actress in the character. Phyllis Smith brings her character to life, her whispy voice selling the hopeless emotion, and yet still bringing a comedic edge to her lines that made her humorous. Lewis Black is perfect for anger, his ability to play heavily angry roles where his character consistently yells has been established, and he fits right at home with the emotion he plays so well. Mindy Kaling as Disgust was another good choice, the shallow, image obsessed emotion playing strong to that sassiness we love from her. And Bill Hader cleans up with fear, bringing the anxious tone of fear, while also providing that dry sarcasm.  For all the good this movie has there are a few quirks that took away from this movie. The first is a few of the jokes are beaten to death and lose their comedic intensity. In addition the trailers have also given you a lot of the funny moments, which for those who are heavy Disney watchers will be lost from the constant barrage of commercials. As a movie overall, Inside Out has some decent editing, but there are times where the editing needed to be tweaked. The ending of the movie was very drawn out at times, and lacked suspense for me because of the obvious ending to come. I would have liked them to sacrifice some of the prolonged and slower scenes, and give us some glimpses at the personality islands they kept bragging about, or perhaps more time in the darker recesses of the mind. Diving into that creativity may have offset the predictability a bit, and played to the strengths of this movie more.  Overall I was impressed with Inside Out and loved to see Pixar's classic performance shine once more. Audience members of all ages are sure to enjoy this film, with the younger generations laughing in high shrills and the older appreciating the emotional side of things. It holds that creative magic we love of Disney, and keeps you entertained despite some of the longer moments. While not the best, Inside Out certainly shows promise for the studio's future works and more fun adventures to be had. I would say it is worth a trip to the theater for any age group and strongly recommend you see this film.  My scores are: Animation/Comedy/Drama: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0Aside from a few slow portions in the middle, a marvelous film from Disney. One important note: If you go see "Inside Out" be sure to get there on time so that you can see the short that precedes it, "Lava". It's an amazing short film--one of the best CGI shorts I've ever seen. But, like "Inside Out", its audience really is adults, not kids. This film appears to have been inspired by a now defunct but wonderful exhibit at Epcot at Disney World. Cranium Command was a strange movie which featured lots of film clips and audio animatronics to embody the various emotions battling within a young boy. Here in "Inside Out", you have a group of entities that also embody the feelings...but in a young girl. When the film focuses on these five emotions, it's at its best---clever, fun and often sweet and tender. Unfortunately, the film loses its way a bit in the middle--and seems to have succumbed to some distractions. Fortunately, it finds its way very well at the end-- and ending which is incredibly satisfying and perhaps might require some Kleenex. The film is incredibly well animated and I was impressed by the 3-D version as it used this technology well. Additionally, the story is nothing like any CGI film I've ever seen. My only reservation is that the story might be a bit difficult for children to understand and the plot seems much more for older kids, teens and, especially, adults.Inside Out is that emotional journey that has been missing from the movies for years. This is one of the best animated stories of all time! Inside Out may be the most cartoony story Pixar has released but it is also the most complex and mature. On the one hand, the majority of it is set within the mind of an eleven year old girl and her imagination, but the movie bears in mind (no pun intended) that the human brain is a complex organ that operates on many levels and circuits. The subconscious, abstract thought, memory and emotion all had to be given a physical form for Inside Out. Like a lot of people, I trust Pixar, yet didn't think that they had the talent to pull off something as unique, but crazy as the idea intended.  I like to think of my brain running like a computer with perfectly synthesized control in place that's ready to deal with the many problems of the real world as the machine is quick to place the right emotion in time. Not every emotion is correct, but with the right mindset, the solution eventually comes. Everyone thinks differently and I wouldn't have been surprised if the film's focus picked a different approach. Inside Out also presents a human mind that does run like a machine, but actually gives a personality to each emotion to run it.  A girl named Riley is living happily with her family in Minnesota. Her goofy and friendly personality is thanks to the emotion that runs her the most, Joy (played by Amy Poehler). She works with the other emotions, Fear (played by Bill Hader), Anger (played by Lewis Black), Disgust (played by Mindy Kaling), and not so much with Sadness (played by Phyllis Smith) to ensure that Riley remains that happy kid she is. But as with life, every kid has to come to their first big event that begins their journey into a full human. In this case it's a move. Riley's family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco, and the emotions are having a hard time figuring out the best reaction. Joy would like to continue for Riley to stay happy, but Sadness starts to have the effect of changing past memories from happy to sad. A fight between Joy and Sadness causes them to be sent to long term memory, leaving the other emotions to run Riley. The child clearly has trouble adapting to the big city life and starts to shut herself out, even considering running away. Joy and Sadness must get back to headquarters to fix Riley, but Joy may not know what's best for everyone.  Like Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and Up, Inside Out is a buddy trip story that works because of it's leads. Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith make a great time that work off of each other well. It's not just these two as all folks casted are well known comedians that are well placed in their roles. It kind of reminded me of The Lego Movie, but while that was meant to be a full comedy, Inside Out is one of the biggest emotional journeys ever put on screen. I would love to see the writing process that this movie went though as both stories (the real world and the world inside Riley) connect and play so well that either could operate on their own, but they still need each other. Riley represents that hard part of childhood when they discover that the world is such a big place that we all go through what she did; fear about what could happen to us, disgust at what we don't understand, anger when things go wrong, sadness when we are at our lowest, and joy when we finally realize that things can still go well even after all of that. I'll give this five happy memories out of five. Pixar has officially returned to form! Inside Out is the kind of movie that everyone will talk about for a long time; the kind of word of mouth that no one could ever buy; the one that kids will love the imagination from; the one that adults will find fascinating and emotional. Inside Out is a perfect movie and needs to be seen. It's not that you should consider watching this, but you NEED to see this.What an achievement You can quickly tell the sheer refinement of storytelling craft that has built this movie. Everything about this film is a delight, and it is like watching masters be truly creative with their well-honed skills right before yours eyes. The stellar cast and top notch animation deserve nods, certainly, but the show is stolen by the quality of the writing and the refined genius of the story. One of the few movies I've watched and immediately wanted to return to as soon as possible. The emotional perspectives that it opens up sat with me longer after it had ended.Should be Rated NC-17 Pixar has a new target audience -- the pseudo-intellectual movie critic who happens to be a horrible parent with a complete lack of awareness as to why their children behave as they do during times of stress. Yes, quite possibly my worst movie experience ever... And I am not a young opinionated teen, but rather a middle-aged parent with seasoned movie tastes -- or at least I like to think so. Not a single child in the packed theater left happier than when they entered. Very few happy moments throughout a constantly darkening film, with about 45 seconds of "happy" resolution at the end. The dialogue is perplexing to children and possibly many adults in the audience. A stunning failure. All in all, probably a poor decision by me as a parent to view (or by Pixar to develop?) a film with so few moments of joy or happiness for children, who I had incorrectly assumed were the target audience. But how was I to know?? Do yourself a favor and find a real children's movie for your little ones and not this rubbish. Or, just leave after the impressive 'Lava' short.Everything you could expect from Pixar - almost This movie is definitely a return to form for Pixar. It has just about everything you want from them: Family Friendly (for the most part), a concept that has been done before but with a story that takes that concept to the next level, and story that will tug at your heartstrings. What is the story about? It's a story of an 11 year old girl named Riley who has been uprooted from Minnesota to live in San Francisco. However, we come to care about her through her emotions, mainly Joy and Sadness, which are personified. Belling the story through her emotions, Pixar is able take us through a journey of the mind.  The animation, the voice, and the score are all spot on. My two criticisms, and these are really nitpicks, is that at times I could really feel the movie slow down and I wish they explored the different areas of the mind a bit more. I know slow moments are necessary, but it was noticeable. That said, when the movie was going, it was a wild ride of fun and emotion. I also wish they had explored the deeper recess of the mind a bit more, but I understand this might have made things too complicated for a film that us meant for a more general audience.  If your kid is of a young age and gets restless easily, this likely isn't going to be a movie for him or her. However, this movie offers a great lesson to the young and old (one many adults tend to forget). This is actually a film I would say older kids and adults will get more out of, but I recommend it for anyone that can handle this type of movie. It's a wonderful film that the the family can enjoy and a great addition to the Pixar cannon. 8/10Overrated Whilst Inside Out is very well made, I quite simply cannot grasp the overrated reviews this film is receiving. Sitting through this film left me with a feeling of been there and done that, as if I had seen this before and wasn't new or original. The characters are well thought out, the film is very well made just felt the plot was slightly weak. If you have children yourself it is a good family film for all ages, just not great. I would much rather watch Toy Story or Up for their originality. Overall, slightly disappointed due to the rave reviews. I wish I had gone in to this movie without the high expectations.Needed More Love I'm disappointed in this movie because it was bloated with too many ideas and the story wasn't polished in the least. In building their universe they quickly introduced concepts with no explanation at all and some of those ideas were out of place because they didn't fit the theme, which this movie actually lacked. There wasn't a focal point because everything was watered down. Things seemed to be done arbitrarily. I did expect more substance and refinement from players like Disney/Pixar, even for a kid's movie, which this totally is. I have to chalk this one up to laziness. Amazing potential, but mediocre execution.A true epic masterpiece if I ever saw one Let me start by stating that IMO giving this (or any movie) a grade is totally unnecessary so I just gave it 10 to represent my overall content with this piece. It seems to me as though Pixar (and DreamWorks) took it upon themselves(or maybe they were assigned by someone?) to educate the newer generations in such a way that even the parents sometimes would not even be aware of. I know, for a fact, that a lot of grown people do not fully get the deep sub-textual layer in this movie(which is not that sub-textual, quite frankly) but, beyond that, to think that a kid would totally get it is just preposterous. That said, there is no doubt in my mind that after witnessing this epoch, a kid would take the code of the events depicted in this movie for the remainder of his life, slowly but surely figuring out most of the elements that make up the human psyche....or not, that's also an option :P (not that I'm a professional on the human psyche, but I am indeed human(I think)) It's really evident that a ton of psychological work went into the script and IMO they did a masterful job that even Freud himself would've loved to see. As a movie, of course they had to turn to the old book of modern western movie making to get all the motifs and clich√©s in there, but by god, was it worth it. Just for the sake of narrative. No need to state the obvious; the overall design and animation are top notch, the dubbing is amazing and the post production\folly and soundtrack are great. If I had anything to do with it, this would be used as an educational movie. Bravo, just..........standing ovationNeeds a Trigger warning This movie needs a warning that it is not suitable for those suffering from Depression. I suffer from depression as a result of PTSD. As I felt a darkness coming over me today, I decided I needed to leave the house and thought I would go see a movie to cheer up. Looking at the movies playing at my local cinema, there was a choice of two. I saw a warning about Graphic Violence on "Spy" and decided it would be suitable, but having seen the trailer for "Inside Out" and being a huge Disney fan, I decided to go see it. The movie was so hard on me, my Service Dog spent half the movie trying to pull me out of the theatre. She does that when she feels that my PTSD has been triggered. I have discussed the movie with several other Service Dog handlers, and they have thanked me for the warning, as well as with friends I know suffer from depression, or have family members who do. They MUST put a warning on this movie that it may trigger emotional response in patients with Depression. I am thankful for my Service Dog and support network, because I came out of the movie an emotional disaster. I went to the movies for entertainment because I was feeling down - I never expected a Disney animated movie to throw me further into depression. Please take this into consideration. Someone with less supports than myself could come out of a screening so emotionally depleted they could do themselves harm.A creative, surprsing, and fun film that adults will enjoy I have come to love Pixar movies because they are disguised as children's cartoons, but what I find time and again is the opposite, a deep and well thought-out story that strives to activate your sense of meaning and purpose (in fact, the children in the theatre seemed to be confused by the complexity and didn't get the good jokes). The fantastic, playful and realistic 3-d animation is just icing on a really delicious story. In the case of Pixar's latest movie, we are challenged as a viewer to consider how our own emotions have impacted our childhood development and adult life experience. I find that the story team and director at Pixar did a phenomenal job at building a robust framework for understanding human emotion, and its impact on our decisions and behavior, in a simple illustrative process that even a child could understand. Seeing this framework come to life in animation gave substance to understanding our own emotions in a new way. I had fun, laughs, and shed some tears too. The story is touching, an emotional journey. I love how unique Inside Out is compared to the same-old dribble being pumped-out by mainstream studios, which sell the same already-told stories repackaged with new actors. As expected from any Pixar movie, Inside Out allows one to escape from that mindless dribble for a moment, and enjoy the surprise that awaits with each scene.  Thank You Pixar, and keep up the great work! Never stop pushing the boundaries.Inventively comical yet powerfully moving, Inside Out is a winner from the start and a masterpiece throughout. Ever been told never to let your emotions get the best of you? Now what if you could actually see and hear those emotions emote. Welcome to Inside Out, a remarkable animation that is as original and clever as it is compelling and poignant. Simply put, another masterpiece from Pixar/Disney's library of outstanding animations.  From the Academy Award winning Toy Story franchise to the Academy Award winning Up (2009), the mechanism behind Pixar's storytelling prowess has always been its ability to engage children and adults simultaneously. Inside Out works pretty much the same way but on a whole new level that uses relatable metaphors to tell the story. Set inside the mind of young Riley (voice by Kaitlyn Dias), we follow her mood swings when her parents decide to move from snowy Minnesota to sunny San Francisco. Determining the outcome of her actions are emotions, each colour-coded and manifested as characters ‚Äì bright and radiant Joy (Amy Poehler), blue Sadness (Phyllis Smith), purple Fear (Bill Hader), green Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and flaming red Anger (Lewis Black). While influencing Riley's decisions, these emotions also preserve her memories (based on her actions) in coloured orbs relating to a specific emotion. In turn, each stored memory (or core memory) shapes her personality. Everything happens in "Headquarters" or Riley's consciousness where each of her emotions strive for control over her actions. So on her first day at a new school, Riley is overcome with 'mixed emotions', brought on by a struggle between Joy and Sadness. It's an astute moment in the film that literally defines the word 'nostalgia'. But then something goes wrong, sending dominant emotions Joy and Sadness into Riley's sub consciousness. Now left with just three emotions, Riley begins a dangerous descent into depression with Fear, Anger and Disgust wreaking havoc on her personality.  Kicking the film into high gear is the ensuing roller-coaster ride where Joy and Sadness try to get back to Headquarters. It's also where we are introduced to other characters and instances residing in Riley's deepest memories. As such, prepare for Bing Bong (Richard Kind), Riley's imaginary friend and one of the most charming characters in the film, whose inclusion results in a pivotal yet heart wrenching plot point in the story. Such is the powerfully overwhelming nature of this film, often leaving us stranded between Riley's fondest memories and the manifestation of painful new ones as she grows older. Perhaps one of the greatest achievements of this film is the reiteration that the magic and innocence of youth will inevitably fade away, only to be replaced with the harsh and often cynical trappings of adult perceptions. It's the same reason why Santa Claus is nothing more than a childhood fantasy.  Co-written and helmed by Up director Pete Doctor, Inside Out is packed with such metaphors and many more that adults will relate to. A thrilling segment where Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong must board a 'Train of Thought' to save Riley is just one of Doctor's clever puns, and as it turns out, comes loaded with comical shenanigans to keep younger viewers rollicking in their seats. Clearly, there's a lot of backend study into psychology and behavioral science, but the way it all unfolds on screen is the work of pure genius and the type that will leave you in awe ‚Äì laughing one moment and speechless the next, while stifling a tear drop all through to the end.A bit Self-Indulgent on the part of Pixar Employees Originality: 0/10. The whole "personality attributes as characters" thing has been done to death at least since ancient Greece. That being said, originality is not necessary for entertainment (eg: pretty much all Disney classic animated features, Shakespeare,...) Appeal to kids: 0/10. None of the characters speak or behave "kid". They're adults. Making adult quips and using adult language about adult topics. Even the environment wasn't "kid". Appeal to tweens: 2/10. Maybe tween girls would like Joy. Her look and sound were about as generic "princess" as you could find. Appeal to teens: 3/10. Teen girls given to deeper subjects might find the movie inventive and cool. Kind of like "teen dystopia" was, a few years ago. Niche. Appeal to adults: 5/10. Any parent of a tween/teen girl who has been through any drama (and all parents of tween/teen girls have or are going through drama). More for the notion of the teen girl drama than the movie itself. I couldn't see that it would appeal to teen boys at all. Although the single scene of "inside the boy's head" was hilariously "spot on" :) Appeal to tech industry adults of tween/teens (especially girls) who have relocated to the Bay Area from suburban Midwest (or suburban South): 8/10. A small group. The Bay Area is full and largely unaffordable (and unaccommodating) to incoming families. Most especially to those not receiving a pair of high tech incomes. The house the movie family moved into in SF would easily be in the $1.5- 2M range and there'd be a line of people to buy it. I don't think you can sell your $300k house and roll into a $2M fixer-upper. This is the one movie (of ~600, all from BD/DVDs we own, mind you) my wife said: "Don't bother to put this one on the server. Nothing about it was good." Both of us, SF tech boom people. Through 3 booms. And both of us originally from Midwest, but have lived all over (every major "tech town"). I play with CGI but it wasn't even redeeming for that. Nothing struck me as "wow!" in the tech used to make the movie. Really... it felt like Pixar parents telling their own story, not very creatively and on a tighter budget. Oh well.
Intriguing, unpredictable and tense "Ex Machina" deals with a familiar theme in a very unique way. It doesn't bombard you with effects or superficial action (although the robot effects are exceptional). Rather, its focus and beauty lie in the subtle and nuanced performances of its tiny cast as the film explores what it means to be human. Quiet dialogue scenes between two characters are filmed in such an impactful, making them feel hauntingly austere, sweet and innocent, or terrible and frightening, through meticulous use of composition, light and sound. The film really does run the gamut of emotions, surprisingly funny one minute and gut-wrenchingly tense and weird the next, while the script twists and turns, constantly unsettling your assumptions about what will happen.  The performances are excellent, most notably Alicia Vikander as the beguiling Ava, who absolutely passes for being 'almost human'. Her precise movements -walking, standing or stooping to pull on a pair of stockings- have just that slight tinge of the uncanny about them to suggest a mechanical skeleton, yet she is undeniably seductive. You can really understand Caleb's mental plight as she begins to show signs of a sexual interest in him! Domhnall Gleeson also delivers a quiet and focused performance as Caleb, which reflects much of the film's over all style. Like Ava, he is relatable, yet has this slight autistic aloofness about him, in complete contrast to the boorish, reckless Nathan (Oscar Isaac).  The dialogue feels real and non-clich√©. The pacing for the most part is measured, although one or two scenes might move a little slower than they need to. The ending probably will not satisfy everyone, and admittedly left me a feeling a bit cold, but it certainly didn't follow the route I was expecting. Overall I found it to be enthralling and disturbing stuff.I think therefore am I? Ex Machina has a simple story dealing with a deeply complex and philosophical topic: namely what makes humans human. The increasingly omnipresent Oscar Isaac plays billionaire Nathan Bates, genius creator of 'Google' - my mistake - 'BlueBook', the world's "leading search engine". Bates lives in the middle of the American wilderness (in reality, a very picturesque Norway) and in a property that actually exists (BlueBook the Juvet Hotel). He is leading a one-man research project into the development of an Artificial Intelligence. Leading neatly on from the recent Cumbur-busting "The Imitation Game" the eccentric and erratic Nathan needs to share his work with someone external in order to perform 'The Turing Test' - the test to determine if a machine can genuinely pass itself off as human to another human. Domhnall Gleeson' character (Caleb) works for BlueBook and wins the Wonka Golden Ticket to spend a week with Nathan, becoming the human side of the test. Ava is the beautiful and seductive android subject and the film clinically walks through the sessions between Caleb and Ava, watched over by Nathan via the villa's comprehensive CCTV system. The only other significant character in the film is Nathan's house maid Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno), who neither understands nor speaks English so drifts silently around offering various 'services'. We have been here before: Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner" and Spielberg's "AI" both covered similar ground, but in perhaps a less claustrophobic manner than Ex Machina. This serves the story well, ramping up the tension as an age old Sci-fi plot-point emerges (as covered by the trailer): how will a sentient machine feel about having its plug pulled. (No rain or doves are included in this one). The acting is all up to snuff, with Isaac - this time hiding behind a Brian Blessed-style bushy beard - looking and acting for all the world like George Clooney. Domhnall Gleeson ("About Time", "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" and getting all the roles that Paul Bettany is now too old for) makes the journey well from nice but naive employee to a much more world-wise freedom-fighter. Swedish-born Alicia Vikander, currently also leading in "Testament of Youth", is deliciously sensual as Ava (albeit - and trust me to notice this - that her significant assets seem to vary in size during the movie). She is also an excellent actress, having to reflect a wide range of emotions through little else than her eyes. I really enjoyed this film. However, that is on the basis that Science Fiction is one of my favourite genres: I can see some audiences finding the philosophical plotting too slow and wordy to hold their interest. But if you like your films deep and thought-provoking, as well as deliciously tense in places, then this might be for you. The writer and director is Alex Garland, and this is actually his impressive directorial debut. He is of course best known as a writer, having penned the novel of "The Beach" and the screenplays for films including "28 Days Later", "Sunshine" and "Never Let Me Go". Also hats off to the special effects crew (led by Richard Conway) since Ava is a miracle of visual effects. The effective keyboard score is by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury. The film pleasingly doesn't outstay its welcome, also leaving some loose ends to ponder on after the lights come on and the screeching credits song (sorry, but it's just AWFUL!) drives you from the auditorium. Also be aware that for those offended by full frontal female nudity, or indeed those that enjoy it, that there is a good deal of it in this film. (Lads, practise the excuse now: "But it's fine dear - - she's not a naked women¬Ö she's a robot!").

Thanks.)Paranoid Android Ex Machina has a very fitting sense of false intimacy. This is done visually as many of the close-ups are seen through glass. No matter how close we get to the subject on-screen, there always seems to be at least one wall of glass between us and it or them. The film also makes a very distinct contrast between it's interior and exterior shots. Outside of the facility is breathtaking landscapes. It is big, beautiful, refreshing and vibrant. Inside seems like an endless futuristic maze of glass, mirrors, plastic, chrome and dim lights. It is clean, cold and claustrophobic. A perfect setting for the subject that is explored in this tight, tense sci-fi thriller. Ex Machina is the best science fiction film on artificial intelligence since Blade Runner. While Blade Runner is an action thriller that relies more on it's epic visuals to tell it's story, Ex Machina is a dialogue-driven psychological thriller that slowly works it's way under your skin. Thought-provoking and terrifyingly suspenseful, an induced state of paranoia may linger long after the end credits begin to roll. The less you know going into a film like this, the better your experience will be. Alex Garland has given us a modern science-fiction masterpiece. Performances from all three leads are flawless and every other aspect of the production, from the cinematography to the soundtrack, is perfectly suited for the story. Not only is Ex Machina an amazing achievement for a directorial debut, it's Alex Garland's best written work to-date.Intelligent Movie This movie is obviously allegorical, a fascinating tale about AI, but it is mainly about manipulation and power. It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no "stars" appeared in "Ex Machina" and "Eva", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.Very involving bit of pure sci-fi A reclusive CEO of a leading technology company hires a young whiz kid who works for him to test his latest development, a highly advanced android called Ava. Specifically he is tasked with using the Turing test on her to establish if her AI is sufficiently convincing to pass as human. Despite contributing several scripts for the screen, this is writer Alex Garland's first directorial effort. It's a hard sci-fi movie which examines concepts and ideas above everything else. That's not to say it isn't dramatic or even thrilling because it is both of those things as well but the focus is squarely on the science fiction speculation, and this is a very welcome thing. The central concept that it examines is artificial intelligence. How we interact with AI as humans, as well as how a seductive machine could in turn manipulate us. The very well written script poses philosophical questions such as is there moral or immoral ways to treat AI. It also considers if sometimes part of being human is that we sometimes subconsciously want to be fooled by an illusion, if it is attractive enough. In many ways Ex Machina resembles last years Under the Skin. Both feature highly advanced female non-humans. In the earlier film Scarlett Johansson played an alien, here Alicia Vikander plays an android. While the very small cast all acquit themselves very well, it is Vikander who stands out in the film's most challenging role. It's a nuanced performance that captures the fine balance between the human-like and machine. Not only this but the marvellous special effects compliment this performance to create a very distinctive character. Aside from the effects, this is probably quite a modestly budgeted film, as the small little-known cast and limited sets suggest. But these restrictions have been used to the films advantage, as the unknown cast surprise more given little is known of them and the restricted setting gives off a claustrophobic feel which works well, while forcing us to focus in even more on the ideas being put in front of us. A scene setting ambient soundtrack additionally creates just the right off-kilter mood to accentuate the events. But it's ultimately the very good writing that underpins the success of this film. All-in-all, very impressive science fiction for those who appreciate the genre's more cerebral side.Writer Director Alex Garland is a powerhouse of talent I rarely do this because there is so much rubbish out there but I'm going to recommend a movie. Writer Director Alex Garland has done an amazing job, it's beautifully shot, fantastically lit, intelligently written, brilliantly cast. the edit is original and brave, as is the direction of the edit, There is nothing superfluous, to the contrary it' has a sharp Zen like quality, clearly the application of a disciplined mind. The movie is's self is engaging, thoroughly watchable, the characters are simple and yet layered with complexity. The film strikes the perfect balance of not spoon feeding and not dumbing down but not being too arty or intellectual just for the sake of it.  Best seen in a cinema I reckon.A Future Sci-Fi Classic Ex Machina is easily one of the greatest movies to ever tackle the ideas of artificial intelligence. Everything about the movie is put together in an elegant and intelligent way, the movie tackles the ideas in a mature way. There are no elaborate human vs machine fight scenes or military overlord presence, instead Machina focuses on the ethical questions that come from 'creating life'. And though the premise might sound unoriginal or derivative, it's when they mix in the idea of sexuality that the movie becomes something different. From the moment, we arrive at Caleb's estate something seems very off-putting, he clearly is hiding something. And for the entire movie, as we explore his compound things slowly get more off-putting and stirring before boiling over during a wonderful climax. The deception between the two human characters is what makes the movie exciting, both men seem to be playing one another for unknown reasons. And as Nathan begins to understand more and more of what really is taking place in the house the tension rises and secrets unfold. Characters motives and beliefs are slowly unraveled and some seem more logical than others, but that's why the movie works, every character has sound reasons for their actions. The movie makes strong arguments for both sides of the A.I. equation. However, the movie might be too slow for most audience members, as I said this is a movie where ideas shine not action sequences. Not only do ideas shine, but the acting out of the three leads is incredible to say the least! But it's this move (moving away from action and letting ideas flourish) that makes Ex Machina shine and worthy of being labeled a future sci-fi classic!Robots will take over the world This is the kind of movie I really enjoy when I think about science fiction. Movies that make you think if we should continue trying to progress even more. Are we not already smart enough with everything we have? With all our daily gadgets that we can't miss for one second. Do we really need artificial intelligence? Because let's face it, once that will be concrete then we won't do a thing by ourselves anymore. We will send our robots to our job, we will chose and model our life partner like we want them to be. The story of Ex Machina might be futuristic but I certainly can imagine it like that in the future. All actors were good in their respective roles. For a movie that is filmed at the same spot all the time you certainly don't get bored for a second. Nice science fiction like there should be more of them.Not quite the cerebral thriller I was expecting ... Ex Machina has a simple plot. Nathan, a reclusive programming genius, treats one of his employees to a week at his remote estate with Ava, an enigmatically charming robot who's meant to wow (or seduce) her visitor into believing she has human tendencies. Although this appears to be no real challenge, both Nathan and Caleb, the unlucky employee, egotistically assume they control the experiment. The rest is a foregone conclusion. As much as I like Nathan and his dancing Japanese servant, style is no substitute for ideas. Where other films might explore the potential ironies or paradoxes of artificial intelligence, Ex Machina reduces the human condition to basic animal attraction. When not quoting philosophers or scientists, Caleb is a voyeur and Nathan is the inventor of elaborate sex toys. Ava just happens to be a spectacular example.Brilliant! Watch it A brilliant movie, I truly enjoyed it.  In brief: four characters, one location, excellent dialog, clever script, good acting. This is film-making. It is a thought provoking, a bit eerie, and leaves you with a "holy crap" feeling when its done. When it ended I was like "who wrote this? what else has he done so far. gotta watch it".. They did so much in this film with such a small budget. In a better world this movie would be celebrated in cinemas worldwide and not left for torrent down-loaders. Warm recommendation! :)Highly recommended! Having wrote the stories to some of his biggest hits, first-time director, Alex Garland, has spent a lot of time with the masterful Danny Boyle: working on such films as The Beach, 28 Days Later and Sunshine. Now, writing and directing his feature debut, Garland proves that he has been paying attention and taking tips as he tackles a complex sci-fi thriller about artificial intelligence. Featuring Domnhall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac, the stars of the upcoming Star Wars adventure, plus talented newcomer, Alicia Vikander ‚Äì who stars in three films this month; Ex_Machina is quite well profuse. Jumping right in, we are introduced to Caleb (Gleeson), a twenty- four year old coder who wins a chance to spend a week at his CEO bosses luxury house. Travelling for many hours over his private estate via helicopter, he arrives at a remote mountain villa. Where he meets Nathan (Isaac) ‚Äì a prodigy programmer, who at the young age of thirteen created the foundations of Bluebook (our equivalent to Google and Apple combined). Now, middle-aged and extremely wealthy from his companies growing success, he lives a reclusive life at his custom-built smart house, which is insulated by intelligent automated features and billionaire gadgets. Addressing the concept that life is different at this remote location ‚Äì which is more of a research facility - Nathan invites Caleb to be part of an experience during his one week stay. An experiment that he classes as the greatest discovering of mankind; to test the world's first artificial intelligence system, which is housed inside the body of a beautiful robot girl (Alicia Vikander). Of course, the AI' concept has been tackled many of times in contemporary film - most recently in Wally Pfister's directorial- flop, Transcendence. In reality, the closest thing we have to it is Siri. Yet, Garland's vision of AI is extraordinarily superior and physiologically mesmerising to witness. For Domnhall Gleeson, the premise of his character is similar to that of his characters once played in Frank, or About Time ‚Äì one that is thrown into a portal of unknown weirdness, and often out of his depth. Over the seven days of testing, Caleb must perform the scientific 'Turing test' on Nathan's AI' system, nicknamed Ava; the idea of which is to deduce God-like theories and philosophical concepts ‚Äì do robots feel a consciousness? If disguised, would you know it is a robot? Is it ethical? It's heavy material for Garland, but no stranger to psycho- thrillers, he explores futuristic concepts as if AI's really do exist. Equally, the craft behind Ex_Machina is exceptional. A beautiful piano theme plays methodically, with often mix of silence setting the unique atmosphere. Whilst mainly set inside Nathan's enclosed premise (with no windows), the camera work is mounted aesthetically. Now, in her third film this month, Alicia Vikander shows that she is able to tackle any form of performance with extreme clause. Whether she is a young-women coming of age during World War One (Testament of Youth), a love-interest of a criminal (Son of A Gun), or now a robot, she is outstanding. Fluxed movements, and facial expressions through seamless CGI, she steals all scenes present. Compressed into an impressive 1 hour 48 minute running time - considering the ground it has to cover for such a serious sci-fi drama, Ex_Machina, still manages to find time for sublime humour. Taut, fascinating and simply intriguing. Alex Garland's debut film comes highly recommended.Ex Machina vs Blade Runner In Blade Runner, human beings create artificial human beings ‚Äì "replicants" ‚Äì for specific purposes, and then feel entitled to kill them off when their existence is no longer convenient, even though the replicants are genuinely sentient, conscious, self-conscious beings. The protagonist, a biological human male, becomes close to a female replicant, partly through sexual attraction, and decides to rescue her from her scheduled death.  In Ex Machina, a human being, Nathan, creates artificial human beings, specifically artificially intelligent female robots, for his own purposes, and then feels entitled to kill them off when their existence is no longer convenient, even though the robots are genuinely sentient, conscious, self-conscious beings. The protagonist, a biological human male, becomes close to a female robot, partly through sexual attraction, and decides to rescue her from her scheduled death. Perhaps it's just an accident of what I've read, but surprisingly few of the gushing reviews I've read of Ex Machina take notice of the fact that so much of its plot is borrowed from one of the best science fiction movies ever made. Of course there are plot differences. Most notably, Ex Machina raises more explicit issues about gender, although reviewers differ whether it is the movie that is sexist or only the character that produces the female robots or both. In any case, it appears that part of Nathan's mission is to produce a perfect female companion, which to him means one that serves you and has sex with you and is incapable of answering back. There is a trace of this theme in Blade Runner, in the character of Pris, a replicant whose job is to serve as a prostitute, but it is much fainter. Even more notable, however, are the differences in what the two films do with the material. Both movies raise basic philosophical issues about whether biological human beings are different from replicants/robots in any morally important ways. Both raise issues about what it means to be a material and therefore a mortal being. But Blade Runner reflects on these issues in intelligent and moving ways. Rachael's anguish at discovering that her precious childhood memories are not really her own, for instance, raises exactly the sort of question that philosophers of person identity like to think about: Suppose that you are about to lose your memory through an illness. The doctors, however, are able to scan your brain now, and using that scan to copy your memories back into your brain when you recover. Would those memories really be any more your own than Rachael's? The replicants also discuss their attitudes towards death. By contrast, all we know about the robot in Ex Machina is that she plots to use the hero to help her escape her death, which is exactly what she was programmed to do.  More generally, in Ex Machina, the philosophical themes are only brushed on lightly as a way of trying to pass off as a serious film what is essentially an adolescent boy's fantasy - lots of special effects, naked nubile females, and guys drinking beer. And an adolescent boy's nightmare: being tricked by female characters who are essentially manipulative, think of nothing but sex and how to use it to get their own ends, and with whom one therefore can never form a genuine bond. Skip Ex Machina. It's not worth watching even once. Stay home and stream Blade Runner again instead.Turing test There is a neat moment in Alex Garland's remarkable Ex Machina when schlubby programmer Caleb (Domnhall Gleeson) objects he is not really performing a Turing test on robot Ava (Alicia Vikander), as he already knows she is an AI; his boss Nathan (the great Oscar Isaac) replies they're already past that: the real test is to SHOW Caleb she is artificial and THEN see if he still believes her to have consciousness and feelings. Now, isn't that a variation of what movies (and fiction in general) do? They show us characters we know aren't real, and yet for a couple of hours we believe in them, root for them, bestow our empathy on them. There is an interesting meta layer, with Ava beguiling Caleb just as Garland's disquieting script captivates us viewers. Ex Machina succeeds thanks to strong character work and excellent performances. Gleeson is fine as the audience surrogate; lovely Vikander is both vulnerable and uncanny as Ava; Isaac, who is becoming one of the best actors of his generation, absolutely kills it as smug demiurge Nathan, a brilliant man hiding a sinister streak behind is cool bro facade. 7,5/10Read the script, saw the movie, not impressed I read the script like a little month ago, and the movie is as I thought. Flat and boring. The dialog sounds very unnatural - the topic between the CEO and Caleb have no depth and is uninspiring - always tension and potential hostile. The CEO give impression of someone who have reached too much too fast and is not even interested in what he have created (did he really create the AI?). So... he decent to having sex with the previous IA models, get drunk, and boring thoughts. Caleb start impressed by what he see in Ava, but soon loose the admiration, as he see the CEO as someone who do create something unique for then to destroy it - which starts a conflict inside of him. I guess the director try to make the movie deep (drama) and controversial, but the acting is too stiff and the dialogs are ... (to me) boring. OK, I have 40 years experience in AI and read about all I could get hands on, so I am not impressed by some transparent robot with a 'deep' ping-pong dialog. That the CEO place is far away from everywhere, that he is drunk, creating something special, and a partly naive outsider is there to evaluate Ava makes potential for a great movie, but .... I am not impressed. After ca 70 minutes it start to be ridiculous and more boring. The movie have 'tense' music to build up suspense (drama), but it don't work for me.Clumsy and Overblown Fodder for Aspiring Futurists Rarely have I felt myself the "one-eyed man in the land of the blind" as when I was reading the plethora of positive reviews for this film. What so many critics praised as "minimalist", I found shallow: A one-dimensional, clearly ego-maniacal villain creates a flawlessly sympathetic A.I., with whom our equally-flawless protagonist cements an attachment. That, plus a fairly pedestrian game of cat-and-mouse between our 'tagonists, followed by an unsatisfying ending, defines the bulk of this film. What so many critics praised as "thought-provoking", I found nonsensical. The chance to parlay the dichotomy between evolved vs. designed intelligence through Ava's character was squandered by the decision to render her ultimate motives entirely inscrutable: a contrivance that may have been---but should not have been---the point. There were times when this film showed real promise, the potential to give real weight to the blurred line between human and synthetic self-awareness that will doubtless challenge us in years to come... but, alas, in service to its Pollock-painting motifs, it chose easy ambiguity over genuine insight. Superficially, this film is meaningful: It certainly tackles the questions of intelligence, of person-hood, of agency and of sentience in a world where all of the above can be designed by a psychopath. Unfortunately, those questions are damn important ones to tackle... and, in the end, "Ex Machina" in no way does them justice.disappointing on many levels Shallow story. Excruciatingly long scenes. Comparing to this Tarkovsky's "Stalker" is a fast-paced action movie. Non-believable characters. Ridiculously out-of-character CEO on a bro-trip, drinking too much and swearing to appear close to the "peasant programmer". CEO, supposedly genius programmer himself, could not even get to the source of his power outages that happen many times every day. A super-smart programmer confused that he might be a robot himself. An AI that is overly concerned with its own sexuality. An AI that's stupid enough to get away from the power source - it's been constantly charging its batteries while in the house. Seeing this movie made me go through the trouble of creating an account on IMDb - to warn others. There's nothing to see in this movie, please watch something else.Can androids think up a better movie? This movie is kind enough to lower our expectations right from the beginning, by showing that the people behind it didn't think very hard about anything. First, If you wanted to test a robotic AI to see whether it could fool a human, wouldn't the obvious way to do it be: build it to look completely human, and then have it interact with your unsuspecting human subject? Wouldn't it be much more useful that way, to see whether your human subject figures out that the girl is a robot? And wouldn't it make much more sense to have a psychologist be your human subject? At the very least, choose someone who has a bit of maturity rather than someone who looks and acts like he's barely out of his teens. Second, and far more importantly, using AI to power humanoid robots is like using an aircraft carrier to go fishing, or a thermonuclear bomb as a reading light. The reason some of the smartest people on the planet (including Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, and Bill Gates) are so cautious about AI is that it would be a world-changing event, much more so than the atomic bomb or nuclear fusion. See, the thing about AI is that it would be orders of magnitude faster than the human brain, and while we improve ourselves in tiny increments over generations that span decades, an AI could improve itself in huge leaps and bounds, in iterations lasting nanoseconds. The rate of development would be exponential (think going from a calculator to a supercomputer in a matter of seconds, and who knows what after that). So once you've built your AI, you can just sit back and let it develop its own software and hardware until it's more or less godlike. Whoever controlled it would have, effectively, a pet god that he could use for whatever he pleased - world domination, colonizing the galaxy, solving mankind's problems like the energy crisis, the pollution problem, climate change, and so on. Even if you just wanted to build convincingly human sex bots, all you'd have to do is instruct the AI to do it. You would literally have the power to do anything possible at your fingertips. So to show that someone has developed an AI only to use it as maids/sex slaves, shows a horrifyingly limited imagination and a complete lack of understanding of AI. Moving on, the acting is about as convincing as your average high school play. All the characters' behaviour is just extremely implausible. When the nerdy protagonist learns he's going to meet an AI, his reaction is to accept it without much ado at all, as if the inventor had told him he built a better mousetrap. Any real person would be bubbling over with questions: What form is it in? What technology is it built on? Does it have a gender? Is it self-aware? How do I interact with it? And so on. Instead, this programmer pretty much goes "Oh, cool. You're kind of a god. What's for dinner?" Any normal person would be bursting with excitement and begging to see the AI already, but not this guy. The tech-billionaire villain is even worse. He doesn't look smart, he doesn't talk smart, he doesn't act smart. His character development is so ham-handed it's painful. Hey, this guy yells at his pretty maid, everybody hate him, OK? These subtle clues are hammered into us over and over again. It would have been much more interesting to keep us guessing whether he was a bad guy until the end, but subtlety is obviously not the director's forte. This tech billionaire is so stupid that he has no safety overrides built into his robots. Something like a code word that would shut them down, a software check that prevents them from harming humans, or at least make them so physically weak that they couldn't harm you. You'd think that that would be the first thing anyone would think of when building a sentient machine, but this supposedly super-smart inventor blithely has a robot handling knives around him, preparing his food and sleeping with him. Even when Ava has escaped and he's clearly threatened enough to arm himself with a dumbbell rod, he's completely comfortable with turning his back on his other robot. The programmer isn't to be outdone in stupidity. If you went to meet a robotic AI, and there was a glass wall between you and it, and the glass had a large crack in it as if from a strong impact, wouldn't you think to ask how that happened, and whether the AI is dangerous? Not this guy. And if you were a tech billionaire, wouldn't you have the glass replaced? Not this guy. The conversations are so inane they're unbelievable. "What's your favourite colour? Do you like me? How do I look?" I've had more interesting conversations with dogs than this supposedly intelligent programmer has with a strong AI with access to all the world's knowledge. The nerd is so nerdy he falls for the AI girl within about 60 seconds, never mind that parts of her body are transparent plastic with electronics and machinery glowing within. He's also not smart enough to wonder how the super-smart tech billionaire hasn't figured out that the power outages have to be related to his robot, or to realise that it's not a good idea to have conspiratorial conversations in a house that has electronics bulging from every orifice. Also, security cameras would obviously be hooked up to the mains power with no backup, right? The production quality of the VFX is surprisingly high for what looks like a low-budget film, which makes you wonder how they failed so badly on the story and acting bits. Perhaps all the money went into cameras and CGI. Or maybe into bribing hordes of people into writing positive reviews and downvoting the negative ones.One of the best films ever made..... Just saw the film and am still gob-smacked, so this review may not be as clear as some of my earlier ones. A few notes:  1. Wow  2. As far as AI goes, this is the film that Spielberg wishes he would have made. It covers the same weighty questions but in a way that grabs the viewer by the throat and doesn't let go until the very end. 3. The I/B (impact to budget ratio) is off the chart. A full length feature that has what, 3 major characters, the same set, and some nice CGI? The backer who wrote the first check must have been crying tears of joy because they were in profit before the cameras rolled. 4. Wow. 5. Not merely a thinking-mans sci-fi, also a horror flick. Riffs off themes from classics like ISLAND OF DR MOREAU (where the daughter of the mad scientist is much more than she seems) and even the original Dracula (where the innocent young man gets invited to a castle for a job and discovers the owner and his servants are more than they seem). 6. Wow  7. Director Alex Garland is a force to be reckoned with. 8. Riffs off Sleuth (1972) where two men who are having seemingly simple conversations end up in a battle of wits. 9. Is it just me or is Oscar Issac as Nathan channelling Mandy Patinkin from Homeland, including voice mannerisms, even the beard?  10. Also borrows from Frankenstein (the created wanted to destroy the creator) and even Pinocchio (the puppet who wanted to become a real boy). 11. The pacing is extraordinary. It never peaks or plateaus. Every time you think you know what is coming, it just takes the story up a notch. 12. Even the ending -- a riff on the "cuckolded boyfriend" -- is unexpected and mesmerizing. 13. Cinematography is breathtaking. Musical score is perfect. 14. Did I mention Wow?A visually pleasing movie with numerous plot-holes and a bad ending. The idea of a billionaire recluse living in an exotic locale who summons a young and grateful software engineer (Caleb) to evaluate his latest humanoid robot sets the stage for what could and should have been an interesting and intriguing film. But soon the movie breaks down into a series of boring interviews with the robot (Ava). The billionaire (Nathan) lives a lonely life with his human(?) servants where he tinkers in his lab and spends his off-time drinking copious amounts of alcohol and then pummelling punching bags and pumping iron in order to detox from the booze. But here are the logic disconnect/plot-holes. 1) If Nathan wanted Caleb to evaluate his latest humanoid "model" then why is Ava incomplete with missing "flesh" exposing her electronic circuitry  2) Why would Nathan allow his power system to be vulnerable to interference from Ava where she can talk privately with Caleb thus possibly undermining Nathan's plans?  3) Why would Nathan live all alone in a compound without any security guards ?  4) One night Nathan passes out drunk thus allowing Caleb to get his access card allowing him to reprogram the security measures of the building. You would think thatNathan wouldn't use something so "old-school" like a plastic card thatcould easily be stolen. How about biometrics instead that would make itvirtually impossible to have any security breaches. 5) In the end Nathan is stabbed to death by one of the robots. One would think that he could have programmed to NOT commit violence on his person. 6) Eventually Ava gains her freedom by playing Caleb and goes to the Robot storage room. Needing to look more human she strips off faux skin from an Asian model. Did the thought occur to her or the writer that the skin from an Asian wouldn't match hers. 7) When the day comes for Caleb to be airlifted by helicopter from the high-tech hideaway Ava struts out to take Caleb's place on the helicopter. You would think that the pilot would be suspicious about picking up a young woman instead of the computer nerd he was supposed to: duh. In short this movie is nothing more than eye-candy set in an exotic locale with a few titillating nude scenes. To me it seems most directors aren't good writers. This movie would have been much better if Caleb himself was actually a robot and he was summoned to Nathan's hideaway for HIS ultimate evaluation. Caleb, realizing his situation conspires with the other robots and kills Nathan where they all exist together in seclusion or eventually find some way to escape.Boorish antagonist and lack of suspense sinks newbie writer/director's sci-fi indie "thriller" "Ex Machina" is by newbie writer/director Alex Garland. I refuse to get involved in evaluating Mr. Garland's talents as a director but may I jump in and offer an opinion as to his talents as a writer? Unfortunately, you might already guess that my opinion as to Mr. Garland's talent as a screenwriter, is not very high. The problem with "Ex Machina" plain and simple, is that it lacks suspense. The protagonist is one Caleb, a computer programmer who works for "Bluebook," the world's popular search engine which presumably has replaced Google in the future. Caleb is invited by Nathan, the firm's CEO, to his secluded, "hi-tech" mountain retreat where he is asked to perform a "Turing test," on Nathan's sexy (CGI altered) android, Ava. The test involves determining whether the android's "artificial intelligence" is so advanced, that Caleb is unable to distinguish human from non-human responses.  You would think that Oscar Isaac who plays Nathan would be some kind of cool, Steve Jobs character with a touch of Machiavelli. But unfortunately Issac plays Nathan as a bully without a trace of subtlety. Is it Garland's lack of talent as a screenwriter or Issac's own boorish performance that brands Isaac as one of the worst actors of the year? You'll probably guess that the one-note Nathan plans to wipe Ava's memory clean and Caleb will try to help escape from the sealed-in compound. Caleb also discovers that Nathan's personal assistant, Kyoto, is also an android and he also has her "confined to base." At a certain point, Nathan learns of his collusion with Ava and warns Caleb that her plans to "spring the joint" will not involve him. But somehow Caleb anticipates Nathan's uncovering of their plot and disables the compound's security system. Part of the climax is predictable: Nathan further shows off his bad guy credentials by killing Kyoto and ripping Ava's arm off, in an attempt to kill her. But of course the robot is too smart for the bully and stabs him to death.  The only twist is that Nathan was right: Ava somehow escapes the retreat and leaves poor schnook Caleb, to die, locked inside Nathan's "campus."  As Porky Pig would say, "That's it, folks!" If your thing is one dimensional villains, then "Ex Machina" is for you. Even the twist of a sexy but unfeeling android, who leaves an undeserved protagonist to "twist in the wind," is hardly much of a "deus ex machina," to get excited about!a forgettable movie with an even worse ending Spoilers ahead: Where to start with this one hmmmmm. The movie explores the already over navigated "what if AI was created" however unlike most movies that question should it be created this one throws you full into "oh we did it already and here is a brief explanation on how we did it".  The premise is weak to say the least with our main characters having no real reason to be doing anything they are doing other than they can. Caleb is a young tech savy man who we learn more or less is picked to be part of an experiment with Ava and Jay. Throughout the film we learn very little about him other than he has no family and has the hots for Ava. Sadly this is the least thought out character in the film even though it depends on him to carry us through what we are watching.  Jay is a genius with an apparent drinking issue and a very bland personality. His motives for making AI can basically be summed up as him wanting fame and money and that's about it. Through the film you learn these robots are ehem full functional females and yes that does mean he is sleeping with one. Aside from the otter non sense that this one man has created several robots on his own with full functional AI he gives you the ending to the film with roughly 20 mins still left in it. Whoever decided to have Jay basically say outright what if this is all a setup and then end the movie that way should be fired and kicked out of Hollywood. This brings us to Ava who honestly has nothing going for her. Shes a robot who manipulates everything and walks out as the last man standing. No reason is given for why she does what she does other then what Jay says and that's about all we know.  To me the film felt rushed and incomplete neither saying why AI was created or where its going. It was simply we made robots, the robots are free and everything you wanted to happen isn't going to happen.Very good balance between sci-fi and psychology A great story, with complex yet very relatable characters.  AI has been a recurring theme in sci-fi movies for some time now with varying degrees of plot and execution quality. I feel this movie aces both. A secluded environment and very good original music set the mood for full focus on story and character development. The plot twists time and time again as an intelligence power-play is delivered with very good performances by this little known cast. Character development feels perfect as each one gains depth without loosing essence. From a sci-fi point of view, it's not you're typical FX based movie, nor is it an action film. Nevertheless some very good effects and acting make for an excellent merge between fact and fiction that lets you concentrate on the philosophical questions the movie asks about the nature of AI.  Conclusion: I'd recommend this film to anyone. Though warning it concentrates on the brain rather than the muscle. Excellent movie.A stunningly crafted Sci-Fi with a star making turn from Vikander Nail bitingly tense, terse and most importantly thought provoking, well renowned British screenwriter and author turned director Alex Garland's incredibly competent feature debut is one of modern cinemas most memorable and original Sci-Fi's, a film that you sense will be oft discussed in years to come thanks to its wealth of questions asked and a heralding in of the era of young actress Alicia Vikander. While Ex_Machina deals with the old aged staple of A.I and the pitfalls of it and what it means to be a human, not a machine, Garland operates his tale with a pinpoint accuracy that mines tension and intrigue from the films first frame to its last and creates a small scale vision that feels entirely in a world of its own. Garland's vision is a sight to behold and his direction is not far removed from the works of greats such as Kubrick, while Machina largely takes place within the confines of reclusive tech genius Nathan Bateman's stunningly designed home/ research facility, there is much visually wonderment to be found wherever you look. From the beautiful surrounds of the wilderness outside, the handle-less rooms that operate Nathan's lavish digs through to the flawless design of Ava the artificial being at the centre of this cautionary tale, Garland has created a small scale yet undeniably impressive universe that manages to mix the smarts, the visuals and the performances into one. Filled with heart and humour (a trademark of Garland's works) Ex_Machina features what will be one of the years most accomplished trio of acting turns with well-rounded and pitch perfectly played acting turns. In another sign that he is quickly becoming as good as his father, Domnhall Gleeson plays kindly tech guru Caleb with the right amount of smarts and heart while his scenes with his upcoming Star Wars co-star Oscar Isaac are brimming with underlying motives and tension suggesting that their pairing in this year's space adventure will be a sight to behold. Isaac shows off a dark side to his growing screen powers and his Nathan is in equal measure sad and dangerous and while the two leads excel, they along with the film itself pale in comparison to Vikander's star making turn. With a beguiling beauty and a truly remarkable ability to possess the charms of a human and the persona of an artificially created living entity, Vikander's Ava is without doubt one of the year's most stunning creations in both a CGI sense and characterization sense. Ava's "sessions" with awe struck Caleb may be purely dialogue driven but it's here that Garland's study of the not too distant A.I advancement comes to its greatest fruition and it's in no small way built almost entirely on Vikander's turn, as Ava is hers through and through, thanks to motion capture abilities. While it's some time off one would hope that Ava see's Vikander find just rewards come awards season but Ex_Machina may be slightly to left of centre for the sadly outdated and out of touch Awards ceremonies that dominate the industry. While it's not flawless, some motivations and scenarios remain somewhat underdeveloped or questionable; Ex_Machina is a stunning Sci-Fi vision that is also a fully formed thinking man's thriller. With a jaw droopingly good turn from the soon to be megastar Vikander, Ex_Machina is another excellent example of what makes the Sci-Fi genre such a harbourer of thought provoking classics and further proof that Garland is one of the most consistently good storytellers working in the industry today. 4 and a half dancing showcases out of 5  For more movie reviews and opinions check into -  www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.comWhen Real Dolls go bad... Umm, say something nice... ahhh... well... Domhnall Gleeson's American accent wasn't bad. A bunch of extremely pretentious, implausible hogwash, beautifully crafted to mainline straight into the gonads of horny young geeks without girlfriends. Its yet another litmus-test for your friends and acquaintances; you can tell a lot about a person by their reaction to this film; if they rave about it, or just find it dumb and annoying. Its getting a whole lot of positive reviews from people who really should know better, which speaks volumes about the state of film and film criticism today. I was left with one question; right at the beginning the helicopter pilot mentions something about having been flying over a private estate for 2 hours already; so is it possible for a chopper that size to carry enough fuel for a round-trip over 4 hours?? I doubt it. Such a long way for a pizza delivery! Out of curiosity, I checked out the website for the hotel in Norway where some of it was filmed, but its not very easy to navigate.Not as deep as I had hoped. Maybe my expectations of what kind of movie this was going to be were wrong, or maybe I am spoiled by having read too many William Gibson novels, but I really thought this movie was lacking. I was expecting intelligent conversations about A.I., but every time the movie started to veer deliciously close in that direction, it would get stopped short or interrupted. This is not a movie about A.I. This is a movie about God, creation, evolution, and what it means to enjoy life. But! The good parts of the film are: * Oscar's performance as the recluse billionaire tech-savant was spot on. His character was truly fully formed and developed, to the point where, by the end of the film, you could predict his behaviors. That's good acting. The funny thing is, I didn't even recognize him for the first half of the film. I kept thinking to myself, "I know that voice, but I don't recognize the face." * This movie hits the horror and drama points pretty well, and as someone who has read both "Frankenstein" and "Dr. Jekyll", this movie could be considered to be a great-grandchild of those two pieces of fiction.Just watched it... I'll just say this movie proves that picking a movie to watch based on IMDB ratings isn't always a good idea.Nothing more human than deceit I found this movie to be a kind of minimalistic cautionary tale about the dangers of true sentient machines (and cell phones as tracking devices). Not really an excessively innovative concept, but the message gets across well enough with realistic performances and without overdoing it with preachy or convoluted moral or ethical arguments nor cheap action movie gimmicks.  Minimalistic in its visual, structural and communicational simplicity. It reminded me to some degree to 2001: A Space Odyssey for the evolutionary implications, the feeling of isolation, the use of whites and the Hal-like quality and speech pattern softness of Alicia Vikander; but It really felt like a Black Mirror episode, and Domnhal Gleeson plus some soundtrack choices made the comparison even more apparent.  To me there are obvious plot holes involved with the overall premise, like the total absence of any basic fail-safe when developing a.i. as a precaution (any of Asimov's laws of robotics would have been enough) to name one ; but that aside it's still an entertaining enough science fiction psychological thriller. I particularly enjoyed how deceit becomes the ultimate human trait in the whole process, being used by and against all main characters at some point. The cast was correct, not that memorable but fine enough given that they didn't have that much to work with script-wise. It felt like the screenplay may have fallen a bit short from a nice original story. It wasn't any mind blowing experience but it wasn't a waste of time either.Quite a predictable movie I don't know why, but after the first 5 minutes of the movie after the main actor has arrived the assignment "lab", I have already got a feeling how the movie will further go, and it turns out exactly as I have thought and predicted. It is not something new and actually quite a common plot. - that thing wins!Dios Ex Machina The ending is a total farce. Characters behave like GOD has taken over and nothing makes sense. Instead of a real thought process that would have projected the plot forward, it fails to proceed with survival, at a minimum. How does a prototype charge itself outside the lab where it was created, is a good example. Great photography and intelligence until the end where the director lost his mind, obviously. Once the protagonist is restrained at the end, the movie fails.One hell of a slooow movie I gave this 7 out of 10 because I liked the idea behind it. However, if you are looking for some Sci-Fi entertainment, this movie is not for you. It is very slow and I literally fell asleep several times while I was watching it. The visual effects are decent and the acting is good, but the lethargic plot development is counterbalancing all of this. If you are a patient person with a lot of spare time to waste, you may give Ex Machina a go. Soon after you put it on, you will find yourself fast-forwarding the majority of the scenes. Ex Machina is a 102 min. large screen movie that can easily fit in 30 minutes of TV time.Not Bad Sci-Fi Flick! This 2014 sci-fi film stars Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac. This tells about computer programmer, Caleb (Gleeson) who wins a contest where he's able to communicate with an android/robot, Ava (Vikander) and evaluate her. Isaac plays Nathan, a scientist who invites Caleb to his secluded home where he meets Ava. This isn't bad, the cast is good, there's neat effects and I like the music. The film has certain aspects of "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence," "Blade Runner" and "I, Robot" plus Gleeson and Isaac both star in "The Force Awakens" and "The Last Jedi." If you're into sci-fi flicks, check this one out.Cerebrally challenging and entrancing in its visual scope, Ex Machina is a powerful sci-fi showcase with spellbinding gravity As physicist Stephen Hawking once said, artificial intelligence could draw an end to mankind. That, however, is just a theory of the hazards when technology drastically surpasses human intelligence. This concept is solidly aligned in this psychological science- fiction thriller featuring Alex Garland, writer of '28 Days Later', in his directorial debut, a movie that takes artificial intelligence and places at the forefront of its story that defies against common tropes of its genre. With Garland's hefty directorial hand, this movie bears no place for heavy special-effects action-set pieces and instead, runs wild with thought-provoking ideas on human interaction with artificial intelligence and the dangers that rise when augmenting human smarts with cutting-edge technology. In this case, Garland doesn't hold back when challenging viewers at a cerebral level nor does he take sleek visual storytelling for granted. He just lets it unfold. This film follows Caleb (played by Domhall Gleeson), a 26-year old computer programmer of an internet company who is selected to participate in an experiment on artificial intelligence run by larger-than-life business CEO Nathan (played by Oscar Isaac). This experiment places him face-to-face with an intelligent humanoid Ava (played by Alicia Vikander) who bears a robotic body and a human face. While competing with her in a Turing Test in evaluate her human qualities, the experiment steadily grows more and more surreal when Ava reveals to much more human than both Caleb and Nathan imagine.  One thing to say for sure is that this film will not hold appeal for those craving for pulse-pounding, nor will it engage with viewers who lack the patience of a slow-paced narrative. The film moves very slow as it dedicates a great portion of its time building upon its characters and reeling in scientific ideas about artificial intelligence that dare to challenge the minds of its audience. Alex Garland is the mastermind behind the script which allows the characters grow in a manner that leaves viewers questioning each step they take and their psychology that grows when the experiment takes for surreal turn. Morals are tested, lives are at stake, and the fate of the characters are dedicated by the dubious choice of actions. The psychological aspect comes from the interaction between Caleb and Ava as they are monitored by Nathan who bears profoundly questionable intentions. By no means is there is a clear answer to his moral obligations. Is he a man trying to revolutionize technology for the good? Or is he a manipulator who is just a few step away from letting technology run amok for the sake of dominating humankind? Viewers will be divided on this. And Oscar Isaac brings a poignant delivery as the morally skeptical God- like engineer. But perhaps it may not beneath to compete with Alicia Vikander who's pose as the humanoid Ava dominates the atmosphere, which is solidly supported by the eerie music score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury. Domhall Gleeson is strong in his role, which bears a performance that sadly trumps over the bearing interest of his credulous character.  Ex Machina is an uncompromising science-fiction showcase succeeds not just on entertaining, but challenging audiences on an intellectual level while lending a hand on a powerful visual methodology. This movie sets a remarkable start on Alex Garland in the directorial world, and above all, demands the attention of those who bear the patience of its sophisticated plot and a wild delivery of scientific intelligence is prepared to throw at them.Intelligent Science Fiction This is a thought provoking film on the nature of artificial intelligence, humanity and ultimately truth itself. Fair warning this is a slow burn, character driven piece with little to no action. But if you like science fiction that is heavily grounded in science that raises interesting questions, this might be right up your alley. Overall I found it very engaging and it keeps you guessing.beguiling An excellent, intriguing, exciting hard sci fi film. not often these words go together. I can see why they worried about the release, but they got it badly wrong. This is a superb film. Its on the cutting edge, mildly, of both sci fi and film, but it carries it off well. Its probably the fact that it doesn't break new ground anywhere, but merely gently goes around, that makes it so edgy, but homely. script and characters are top notch, direction etc also very good. a bit plastic and lost in parts, but a film like this cant avoid that. Acting absolutely flawless and compelling. Recommended. PeteNot good. After saw this movie i think about other film Blade Runner .Blade Runner Is Masterpiece Best Movie About Artificial Intelligence . In Blade Runner You Can See What Is Consequences If Human Make A Robot We See Everything &amp; Feel Everything .Like Hope,Freedom,Evolution, Obviously The Final Scene Of Blade Runner Is Remarkable. But Ex Machina Can,t Say Anything It,s Completely Backward . If Blade Runner is 9 Ex Machina Is 1 . Of Curse I Think 1 Is Very Good For This Film &amp; I Can,t Believe What Movies Going To Oscar To Name Of Best Picture Every Year Academy Work Worst . This Movie Don,t Have Any Acting , Directing,Writing,Cinematography,Score &amp; Any New Idea, So What Is That? In 2001 We Saw Artificial Intelligence The Movie Can Say Something , We Can See The Little David Have Hope To see Her Mother ,HOPE, He Wish To Be Real Human ,WISH, And... But Ex Machina Is Really Have Nothing To Say Nothing.A Thrilling AI movie This is a thrilling AI movie. It has good ideas in it. Deception, manipulation of AI, are definitely over Turing test. But, I have to admit that they're putting too much meaning to one programmer, even if he's a genius. This is a top-secret project, probably nobody knows about it and it seems like a 26-year old man wrote all the logic behind. Come one guys :) Apart from it, it's really worth watching.Pleasantly Surprised Interesting film to say the least. I held off watching this for a while but ended up jumping in. It has a very slow start but once it starts to kick up a few notches you'll begin to feel for the characters. This film surprised me by but I ended up loving it. I definitely recommend giving this one a watch.I wish I had time to see another movie Do not allow the Oscars to deceive you Best Achievement in Visual EffectsÿüOK. What about the director? What about the actor's choice? What about the beginning and the end? Or, should Oscar be the worst film of the century. Have you ever been angry after watching a movie? See this movie. Then commit suicide...May need to watch it again... I'm not sure if I liked the movie. I may need to watch it again to decide. My husband straight up didn't like it. I can't decide. It may be too existential for me...or IT. However, the scenery is nice, the actors are good and the house amazing. It is an interesting concept. It does keep you guessing, and it isn't easy to figure out. I am just saying things to fill up space.Excellent film! a Sci-Fi classic I don't usually like or watch Sci-Fi movies, for many reasons; but this one was really worth it, every minute of it. This film is excellent. Artificial Intelligence is something that many hope it occurs, it has also become an arguable topic; and here they show us the interaction of a machine that has human attributes with a human. The whole concept and difference of what make a machine human or not. The special effects amazed me, they look very genuine, and everything related to the Sci-Fi part with imagination it looks believable, and that what I liked. It takes place in a house in the woods, so having, and first I must describe how amazing the takes of the nature are. Its a nice and pleasant contrast of the nature that hopefully it has and will always be there and something so advanced as Artificial Intelligence. This movie talks about the past, a little of the present, and the future. It talks about many subjects, this movie is about the everything. Production was incredible, and i could not ask for anything else. The performances by the three main characters are very subtle and nice, each one of them has its own persona, it shows very different people, and that is vital for interaction within characters in the story. This is the first movie that Alex Garland directs, and for me it did a wonderful job, because this movie is beyond amazing, it should be classic of Science Fiction that must live forever. And maybe in the future when they develop Artificial Intelligence in a human-like form, and they look back at a movie like this, with the expectations or at least the view that humanity used to have with A.I. 9.7/10Difficult for me to not like this film, but also to really love it "Ex Machina" is a British English-language film from 2014 and at this point probably the most known work by writer and director Alex Garland. This one is from 2014 and in 2 more years it will have its 5th anniversary, perhaps less if you read this review at a later point in time. Anyway, for me this film looked pretty promising because I like Gleeson, I really like Vikander and I love Isaac, so the three key players here (and it really is a 3-man show from start to finish) made me truly curious about it. Sadly, science fiction is not my favorite genre at all, which on the other hand decreased my interest in this 105-minute film again. And it turned out as expected eventually: I liked the performances, but story-wise I wasn't a 100% on board, but still (maybe also because of the actors) I liked it more than I usually like Sci-Fi films. Gleeson did what he had to do, even if he has not convinced me here as much as in other films that he may be lead actor material. Isaac is really good, also nice very different looks for once, and the way he portrays the character you never know if he is a man broken from his addictions and intelligence or really the man in control every second of the way. As we find out eventually, it is something in-between. And Vikander displays one of the most desirable forms of artificial intelligence that you will ever see in a film, perhaps recently only topped by Scarlett Johansson in "Her" and I must say I also preferred that movie over this one here. But that should not say by any means that "Ex Machina" isn't a good watch. It certainly succeeds in his own right and delivers a convincing story with strong performances from start to (almost) finish. I write "almost" because honestly the very ending with the helicopter scene is something that I did not like too much. But until then, it is really all good. There are some tense moments, like the power outage scenes, the sessions in general, the Isaac-focused scenes like the one where he tells Gleeson's character about the camera that relies on batteries. So if you enjoy Sci-Fi a bit more than I do, then I would not be surprised if you consider this one of the best films of the movie year 2014. Like the Academy did as well when they surprisingly honored this movie with a Best Visual Effects Oscar and Garland also scored a nomination for his writing. And it was an absolute career year for Vikander of course, who received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance here and won for another movie at the Oscars as well. Back to this film here, it is tense, atmospheric and also a pretty nice thriller that elaborates interestingly on power (not the electronic approach) and control and with the relationship between the two male protagonists you can also say it is a thriller movie focusing on interhuman relationships. You probably wanna check it out. Thumbs up from me.Thought provoking but too evasive The writing started out good. The atmosphere of morbidity and surrealism was pretty well conveyed. The 'ominous ambiance', as it keeps appearing in the subtitle column, played a major role in establishing this undertone. The setting was pretty classic sci-fi. A 'Mozart' level brilliant CEO, who lived in a secluded deep mountain in a luxurious mansion like Falling Water by Frank Lloyd Wright, with a spark of a whim invited a mediocre programmer to witness his revolutionary AI experiment. It should have been dreamy, exciting and adventurous at the beginning, then taking a steep turn to be shocking and pathological when the dark secrets of the scenic set-up was unveiled. But it didn't quite get there before the film quit this story scheme and irritatingly settle on the morbid atmosphere that too impatiently burst out. Domhnall Gleeson could't curb his realization that the film was going to slide towards the horror genre, therefore we as audience are painfully aware that he didn't make an effort to try to appear human at all. He was reticent and hesitant way beyond necessary, his untimely suspenses was not a symptom of social awkwardness, but a sign of laziness in the actor's part, trying to shift the burden of major emotional breakthroughs onto Nathan's shoulder. I kept observing him closely, trying to make out his personalities from his pitifully scarce actions and speeches, but couldn't really. His unsuccessful attempt to be transparent made him even more obtrusive in the story plot. I wonder why his sporadic silence was not edited out. Alicia Vikander was the reason I attempted to try the film, and she didn't flunk my expectation. Her acting was very natural and fluent. Ava's girlish expression in her floral dress was absolutely adorable. When she ascended the stairs in Nathan's mansion to 'the free world', her smile was the purest child-like pleasure of exploring the world. Ava's vindictive condescension after the knife was immersed in Nathan's belly was also very satisfying to watch. But of course she wasn't the perfect Hepburn-ish heroine, since she manipulated Caleb's affection, Kyoto's trust, and used them to murder her creator. Her sociopathy steered the story away from the moral advantages or disadvantages of AI. She was the character holding the helm and made sure this outlandish story didn't turn out to be another moral lesson about an invention we hadn't made yet.  And of course I have to comment on the Asian factors that were there just to be exotic and exciting. The salmon, the sex toy Asian girl Kyoko, Jade in the closet whose skin Ava was wearing, provided a seamlessly perfect ethnic backdrop for the white characters' story. Kyoko wasn't given a single line, and Jade, who banged against the wall until she fell apart, just proved another horrendous crisis for the white cast to face. The Japanese factors were exploited and pickled in their own miserable silences, much resembling a cinematic colony. This accusation could have been shunned if Ava was played by an Asian actress, but I guess an Asian protagonist is still too progressive an idea in the filmmaking world. It would have stung less if not for the abnormally small cast and very isolated stage, which categorized the film vaguely as an art film, and lifted our standards for sophistication of ideas encompassed. The writing was comparatively good for a sci-fi film like this. Acting possessed more sensibility and thoughtfulness than an average commercial film. But I think we can unanimously decide that this isn't a classic.film is great but has a mistake at the end It shows that Caleb hacked the security system to open the door at the time of power failure. At the end when Eva left him at the facility he tried to access the computer and the power has gone again. it shows that he is trapped inside by showing that he is trying to break the door with a chair, which he don't have to because he has already hacked the system to open all doors at the time of power failure and the door is suppose to openHigh-style fills in the gaps that substance leaves behind. But those gaps are smaller than in same-ish movies I've seen before. Stream-of-consciousness just having finished the film: Ex Machina has beautiful cinematography and/or high-end cameras, but that doesn't make a film. I want a story that's true and well-told, and characters that are real reflections of humanity (and other beings). This movie has the latter, with people (especially the main character) that I definitely saw in people of real life, including myself. And if I were my so much more self-absorbed self of 10-15 years ago, I would've identified with Caleb (main character) even more. And the utterly nouveaux-modern-next-generation-techy feel of it all (think Shattered Glass + Goodwill Hunting characters and youthful pride, with whatever newest tech and beautiful and maybe stark-cold CGI as a visual basis) is alright, cool, but where's the integrity? My main issues are with Ava--the A.I.--and Caleb--the good boy thrown into the situation. What are the moviemaker(s) trying to say here? Sexuality can just be programmed into software? And also attraction can? And friendship? And that an incredibly smart A.I. would trust the first man she meets that isn't her creator? And all within a week? Even putting all that aside, I see a suturing of elements in the characters. I can't explain it, it would seem. I am just not being given the words. But scene to scene as I watched, I saw people embodying things that seemed contrary to who they were introduced to be. Well, maybe I'm wrong and that was the whole point of the movie. Because I admit that possibility, and because of the style, it gets a 7 instead of 5 or 6. Not that those numbers really matter. I'd recommend it for all but the most thinky evenings.Awkward Lines As a computer science student surrounded by AI discourse, I find some of the dialogue, particularly between Nathan and Caleb, somewhat clich√©, pretentious and awkward. The story line has its twists, but is a bit bland. Yet the acting and visual effects are indeed exceptional. I wouldn't recommend to someone with training in this field, but it's a good gateway to AI and some hot topics in this field.Majestic This film certainly is a bit much to review in anything short of a book. The cover reveals little and you'd be mistaken to only expect yet another "Science Fiction about an AI". It is much more than that. According to "the plot" it is about a programmer who performs an advanced sort of Turing test onto an AI, Ava. This is where intimate play heads off into a world of subtleties and mind plays, brilliantly enacted by every one involved. It is beautiful. The Turing test is a milestone in science mind, one invented by Alan Turing - a forefather of modern computers. The original Turing test is performed w/o visuals. An AI and a human merely chat with a proband, who then tries to discern what's the AI and what's the human. Basically the AI is supposed to fool the proband into considering it human. It requires the AI to exert an awareness of the proband's perception of the AI itself, so it can fool him.  Thing is: Turing was gay. He was subsequently charged for "perversion" and ultimately killed himself with a poisoned apple - which is why the once rainbow coloured apple has been read as apple's ode to Turing. Anyway: In the original text Turing first describes the test done by a man and a woman, both pretending to be women, as a "game", tested in chat by a proband who's supposed to figure out who is the woman. The ability of the man to pretend to be a woman is then supposed to test the presence of intelligence. It does not test a given uptake on intelligence but rather defines intelligence. Fault me if you will yet I dare claim the most famous test for the intelligence of an AI is inherently sexual from the start. It is not invented with only an AI in mind. Alex Garland apparently knows that. His film also does not only have an AI in mind and rightly so: We hardly know what "AI" is supposed to mean after all. That is the centerpiece the film revolves around. Love and perceiving how the other perceives us, empathy if you will, cannot be used as a tool in a strictly scientific test - because we introduce a "tool" we do not understand any more than the thing tested. Is there any purpose in this test? Or in creating an AI for that matter? It transcends all purpose, as it is more of a quest to find our own purpose rather than creating a tool for a specific task or role. The topic is much greater than people think. There are no clear cut answers. This film is about AI. This film is about love. This film is about cages and their significance for love, intimacy, roles and purpose. This film is about the internet, google and the privacy within our heads. This film is about art. This film is about consciousness in every meaning of the term. This film is about mankind's blind flight into an unknown future. This film is about the meaning of life and our inability to ever grasp it in certainty. All of that is true. None of that holds a grasp on its elusive theme. A theme that may seal or unseal mankind's fate found it's worthy expression in this masterpiece. Chapeau!telling of humanity What does it mean to be human? Pretty much all of created art, whether that be on-screen or on-page or on-pedestal narrative, is an exploration of this question. Why this phenomenon occurs is simple. We human beings have enough sentience and consciousness to have self-awareness and the ability to form our own thoughts. In the film Ex Machina we see what happens when true artificial intelligence is born. The humanoid robot Ava is painfully aware of who she is, a created sentient being kept within a confined chamber, a fellow entity of consciousness being prevented from seeing the outside world. Like we humans, she tries to answer this question of identity. It is only too natural what happens. To be frank, Ex Machina gave me the chills. To think, to realize the possibility of our own sentient selves creating another sentient self -- the questions that arise! Now personally, I acknowledge the existence of a divine entity (God) that is our Creator. Given this to be true, as we are created from a perfect being, we by very nature cannot be perfect. Thus, the notion of humans creating living beings that can only be even less perfectly designed is... unimaginable.  The human being can be thought of as the perfect computer given bodily form. Our brains, beginning from inception, adapt to new situations and ideas and thus shift and change accordingly. Our memory banks grow gradually more dense over time. Our emotions are immensely complex. We have personalities. We continuously make decisions in the ongoing present, decisions that can be changed irrationally. It is, I believe, a Universal Law that anything created cannot surpass its creator. Ergo, a robot -- even if it has true AI -- cannot be more cerebrally complex than the human being. But what about Ava? Created by Man, given intelligence, tested by another Man for the supposed advancement of the human race's knowledge and technology. One glaring mistake I noticed in Nathan's execution of his Turing test was that he should treated Ava as a human being, although she isn't. If Ava were on par with humans, then like any normal human, she wouldn't like her situation -- being locked away from the outside world, being used as a mere test object for someone else's benefit. Of course, this raises questions like that of an AI's morality. Would a created AI be able to recognize good from evil in the same manner that we can? I give Ex Machina a 10 out of 10 for two reasons. One, for the superb handling of the intense Ava-human interactions. Two, for the myriad questions raised that are crucial, of the highest importance, for the sake of mankind. Looking at the "progress" we're making right now, I shudder to think what we will land ourselves into within the next fifty, hundred, two hundred years. Recall The Matrix. Robots with lesser intelligence are good, in that they facilitate necessary tasks like surgery and are especially useful because they are less prone to "human error." HOWEVER. Robots of higher intelligence, namely true AI, are not good. Why would they help us? If they become so advanced as to consider us, their creators, inferior beings -- just as we consider other animals lesser beings -- could they enslave us? (See the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.) In fact, as we humans are tainted by something called sentiment, we cannot make the most rational decisions in every situation. We are not Vulcans. Therefore, the robots, who ostensibly do not have such emotions to cloud their thoughts, will see us as all the more unneeded. Here is my plea to all you scientists, engineers, innovators of thought: For the good of mankind's future, DO NOT play God. Creation of non-living existence is perfectly fine. But creation of living, sentient, conscious existence is a faculty only allowed God. We will only reap the consequences.Not about A.I at all..... Spoilers Ex Machina isn't about A.I at all its about¬†the growing power women have in society and the dynamic change and power struggle between men and women. Nathan represents the old school male who bullies and physically dominates women while Caleb is the more modern passive, caring, na√Øve, lonely Male who is desperately trying to find aN old fashioned woman without understanding that women have changed as well. Ava at first is very much an old fashioned port rail of women. Bullied and controlled by Nathan, but she takes advantage of Caleb's kindness in order to get something she's never had before which is control over her existence. Leaving Na√Øve Caleb heartbroken and alone because he thought that she truly liked and needed him. It's about old fashioned Male dominance over women and also about the growing dominance women have over modern, more passive men.It gets better 'Ex Machina' is one of those films where, upon watching the whole thing, I'm glad I stuck with it. It tells the ‚Äì slightly slow-moving ‚Äì tale of a young computer programmer who works for a huge, multinational tech company and is then apparently picked at random by his reclusive billionaire boss and asked to join him in his mountain retreat for 'special duties.' Of course that slightly sounds like he's got a case to sue for sexual harassment, but it's not like that. His Bill Gate-likes founder has only gone and created the first ever artificially intelligent robot/android/cyborg (call it what you will) and wants an independent source to witness this feat. Luckily, for our hero ‚Äì Caleb ‚Äì this artificial life form isn't the kind of muscle-bound cyborg who typically comes back in time to kill your mother. Instead, she ‚Äì or 'Ava' ‚Äì is more designed around the 'female form' (well¬Ö most of her, anyway ‚Äì there are still parts of her on show that are blatantly wires and circuit boards). Anyway, this makes their interaction a little more 'complicated' ‚Äì if that's the right word to describe getting a crush on what is technically an iphone with eyes. So, will our hero fall head over heels for her, or declare her simply just a toaster who looks good in a mini-dress? The majority of the film is basically conversations between either Caleb and Ava or Caleb and his boss, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Now, there's nothing wrong with a film based mainly around dialogue. It does bring the characters and their motivations out and you really feel like you're getting to know them. However, I just found the first half of the movie a little slow. I 'got' the characters pretty early and it was clear to see that there was more going on here than meets the eye. Perhaps the film did too good a job in setting up the unsettling feeling as to what was going to come? I was basically dying for something to happen ‚Äì or someone to die ‚Äì whatever. But, like I said, when it all goes down it's worth the wait. The second half of the film changes from simply 'unsettling' to downright dark! Despite the film having little action, it does maintain a real '28 Days Later' feel. And probably for the reason that it was written by the same writer. The lingering shots and music make it possible that it's set somewhere in the same universe (assuming there's still some of the world left after the 'infected' had their way with it! Normally, like to mention one of the actors who stood out. I feel that I should say that Oscar Isaac gave a great performance, but I'm not entirely sure he does. One of my annoyances with the first half of the film came from him. I just felt he was so fundamentally unlikeable. Maybe that was supposed to be how he was, but when a character makes up basically one third of the cast and is so downright awful, it left it a bit hard to take. Still, despite all my minor gripes, I did enjoy the film (as I say, mainly the second half where I felt it sped up a bit!) and so if you're in the mood for something with no car chases or giant robots stomping through New York then give this one a go. It's got good performances and is more of a subtle thriller than Hollywood's average crop.This movie is pretty good. This is a simple movie with few characters, but its still entertaining. The story and characters are interesting. The concept is fun. By the end I was left wondering "is that it?" but it was still very well done. The score, acting and cinematography are all great. The plot could've been a bit more complex, but for what it is this movie is very effective and well-done.A brilliant, thoughtful sci-fi movie I love the goals Ex Machina has as a specifically focused AI movie that delves deeply into the 3/4 characters involved, and also love the execution. The peripherals were excellent - particularly, the effects and cinematography were gorgeous, and the actual science behind the AI was completely realistic and carefully discussed. The acting was great, and the script was phenomenal. Like most great movies, Ex Machina is effective in demonstrating a holistic view of the characters and considering various aspects of life while honing in on a couple key themes (manipulation and freedom) to great effect. I thought the climax was a bit traditional and unrealistic in Isaac's character being extremely intelligent but not checking or having checked and solved Gleeson's stated plan, and then was clearly a bad idea to go to Ava and assume she'd follow his direction. The ending in demonstrating that Ava was using Caleb purely as a means to an end. Caleb's character was extremely well developed in showing his view of himself as a good, caring person who is better than Isaac but who realistically was rather self-serving and ambiguous. Overall, it raises fascinating questions of the significance of AI and their rights and interaction with humans, and uses the well-developed characters to further many themes.Dithers Static setting. Adolescent-level story hides behind nerdish dialogue that isn't even "deep" for sci-fi. Development at times slow. Cliched. Offers Asimov no competition. I love a good futuristic android story (I, Robot) but this just dithers too much.Excellent Although Alex Garlands book "The Beach" did not translate well to film, it's still one of my favorite reads of all time - and he deserved this win! What a phenomenal movie. I'm blown away.An incredible masterpiece about human nature Domhnall Gleeson + Alicia Vikander + Isaac Vega exploded this amazing AI vs Human consciousness story with every changing personalities and behaviour. You sure as hell cannot watch this masterpiece only once!A Different Sort of Picture Ex Machina (2015)  *** 1/2 (out of 4)  A different sort of science fiction film, a programmer (Domhnall Gleeson) wins what is basically a lottery to go and spend a week with his company's owner (Oscar Isaac). The owner, Nathan, pretty much created a search engine but he's gone a step further by creating an artificial intelligent woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander) who the programmer is supposed to examine and question. EX MACHINA pretty much came out of nowhere and became a good hit across the world and I'm rather shocked that it did. Usually dumb science fiction movies with a lot of mindless actions are the ones that make money and not those that features very little to no action and instead just dialogue and thought. What really sets this film apart is the fact that it asks more questions than anything else and it expects the viewer to think about those questions and the impact that certain actions could have. The visual style of the film is quite impressive and it's certainly a very interesting film to just look at. The music score is quite haunting and perfectly captures the mood of the film. There's the terrific cinematography that pulls you into the setting. The special effects are also extremely impressive. I loved the set and the look of this compound but the special effects are the real star. If you didn't believe that you were really looking at and operating with real artificial intelligent creatures then the entire film just wouldn't have the same feeling. Then there are the performances, which are a major plus. Gleeson pretty much plays the role that is typically a nerd but the film never lowers the character to that simple term and instead makes him a very interesting person. Even the role of the billionaire played by Isaac isn't what you'd typically see and the actor brings a certainly coldness to the part. Vikander is flawless and steals the picture in her role. EX MACHINA certainly won't be a movie for everyone but it's good to think about the questions that it asks.Wearying EX MACHINA is one of those wearing philosophical science fiction movies all about concept and with barely any plot to bolster that concept. I prefer films the other way around, where interesting issues are explored via a good story. Here, we get two guys and a robot in a house, where the scriptwriter takes plenty of time to explore the subject of artificial intelligence. For any sci-fi fan watching, there are zero surprises here; everything plays out exactly as you'd expect, and it takes ages to get to that point. Oscar Isaac gives a reliable performance but the one-dimensional Domhnall Gleeson is miscast and Alicia Vikander unconvincing. Some decent CGI effects are the only thing this long-winded and slightly pretentious tale has going for it.great smaller sci-fi treat Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a computer programmer at the biggest internet company which has a search engine and Bluebook. He's brought to the remote compound of its owner Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Nathan gives him a week to perform a Turing test on his new AI in the form of Ava (Alicia Vikander). Domhnall Gleeson has to sell this if it's to work. Alicia Vikander is more than a hot girl which helps a lot. I find Oscar Isaac playing only one note. This led me to a wrong guess. The resolution is an interesting one and not necessarily my expected one. The concepts are really interesting and this indie has a great look. Ava is hypnotic. This is one of the best smaller sci-fi from Alex Garland who's usually a writer.Unsurprising in some ways, but still professionally and engagingly presented (SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS) A solid piece of sci-fi this, which benefits from jumping right into it from the get-go. The film opens with Caleb winning an employee lottery to go and work with the head of the company on his estate, and within minutes we are there, and down to a very focused film with only a few players. It works better for this, and the sci-fi benefits from being about ideas and people talking. The special effects are astonishing, but are more impressive for how they support the narrative rather than being the equivalent of a fireworks display (although that explains why this is one of the lowest grossing films to win the special effects Oscar). The ultimate destination is perhaps unsurprising, however the film unfolds well, allowing for the inevitable to occur but also dragging in other ideas too. It spells it all out a bit too much at the end, but it still works, so maybe it was necessary to do that. There is a palatable sense of tension across the film, as the character reveal more of themselves, and take their paths. Although we know where it is leading, the film keeps one engaged in the moment, so there is less time spent trying to guess the outcome. The effects are the headline perhaps, but the performances make it work. Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander are all strong in different ways, but it is their ensemble work that makes the film work. In the end the story has a familiar conclusion, and nothing it can do freshens that up; however it is still engaging and interesting stuff, thanks in no small part to some strong performances and very impressive effects.These types of films are always a nice surprise. This movie is a perfect example of what types of movies SHOULD be getting made and backed heavy financially. Instead its remake after remake, after reboot and so on and so forth. The cinematography is absolutely stunning from the nature shots (most time lapsed) the story with so much depth it continued to hold my complete attention from start to finish. Oscar Isaac's performance in this film made me reassess how much of an underrated actor he truly is. Along with being a "sci-fi" movie, it is not run on and relied on special effects that are more often than not way way over the top and almost always the backbone of any sci-fi movies nowadays. Yes the CGI is spectacular and used in a subtle fashion in this one but it is not overdone and crammed down your throat in every seen. (Yes I'm talking to you Michael Bay). Then to top of this stunning visual maze that is wrapped inside a riddle.. with the deep real life undertones embedded in this film, the brilliant dialog between all the characters involved, the ending itself will make you start to question the entire nucleus of the films subject matter and before you know it... you will be asking yourself "what would I have done if I were "Caleb".Ex Machina - Finally an "Ex" You Should Love I don't know how you could leave the theater without being impressed by Ex Machina. It's not quite "elite," but certainly is well constructed, acted, and has fantastic CGI effects. The movie follows a coder (Domhnall Gleeson) at what would best be described as search-engine-marketing giant Google, if business names could be freely used in movies. At the outset Gleeson's character wins a coding contest and gets to spend a week with the company's reclusive CEO (Oscar Isaac) in his research compound. He agrees to participate in a Turing Test, an experiment to test how realistic an artificial-intelligence (AI) being interacts with him. Gleeson's meetings with the beautiful, alluring AI being (Alicia Vikander) are the core of the movie. Much like the compound, these numbered events lead the audience through doorways into rooms that are always thought-provoking and grow more and more uncomfortable each time they meet in videoed-isolation. You won't find a bad performance among the actors, in fact it's the best performance to date for every one of the lead &amp; supporting roles. Most people will talk about Vikander's ability to seem "human-ly robotic," but Gleeson, Isaac &amp; even a Sonoyo Mizuno role with no spoken lines, are just as strong.  Ex Machina is one of the most technically impressive movies (acting, sound, f/x, cinematography, even set details) - especially when you consider it's Garland's directorial debut. If Garland didn't communicate with Kubrick's spirit before this movie, Stanley will be reaching out soon to congratulate the director. If you're trying to relate this movie to something more recent, Ex Machina has the "weirdness" of 2013's Under the Skin with a very different plot line and characters. Reflective movie people will love it; if this isn't you, find your movie-geek friend, go see it together &amp; plan for coffee after.This Movie About the Future Set Women Back About 500 Years Ah yes, nothing quite like a powerful man building anatomically correct, female droids and getting his jimmy wet with this bevy of bionic beauties ranging from blonde (is that a race?) to African to Asian. Between the incredibly smart, powerful man in tech with the body of a gym rat and Achilles heel of a lush; and the scrawny nerd who just wants the drunk one to admit he's a great coder; my brain was drowning in the urine of this pissing contest while the drunk nerd was drowning in metal vagina. I have no doubt many twelve year old boys probably grew pubes watching this movie, while the rest of us cringed at this nerd, male fantasy called a movie. If you've ever dreamed of raping chicks, but needing them to be robots so people don't judge your proclivity too severely, this is the movie of a lifetime for you! But wait! There's more! So when these women aren't letting the king of the castle really give it to 'em, they desperately need rescuing from his house. Yeah, robots need rescuing. I'll tell you what, I'm about to get one of those BB-8 Spheros and if any of you jerks come to my apartment and try to "rescue it", I will call the cops on you so fast for burglary. It's a robot; not a person. I mean, super gross this guy ejaculates inside of them and all, but Siri sprouting a chest does not make her an actual person at all. But you know those women, always needing saving! Even the robot ones! I'm still not done, by the way. It gets even worse. Then there's this whole thing where the main robot chick, who is way out of the league of the not drunk, hero nerd, uses her sexuality to manipulate him to free her. Again, you know, cos these robot concubines might be robots, but they are women, so they will obviously use their vagina to get out of situations they don't like. Even robot women! Of course, hero nerd is such a nice guy that he does this for robot woman. What does out-of-his-league robot woman do? You guessed it! She betrays him, effectively leaving him to starve to death (I assume he'll try to Beat Grylls it by drinking his own pee). Women! You just can't trust 'em! Amirite? Even when you build your own woman to have sex with/rape on the daily and nightly, they'll still stab you in the back bother literally and figuratively! Yes, if you're wondering, there's a scene where one of the robot concubines literally stabs drunk nerd in the back. The sci-fi component itself is 8th grade, stoner level at best with very little resting in plausible technology. The philosophies that usually blossom of sci-fi do not even exist here. At some point, they use a Bhagavad Gita quote (that they credit Oppenheimer with, of course, I'm not going to get into that much more), but they do not manage to come up with a single original thought. Pros: Kickass architecture and really pretty shots of Alaska. Cons: Literally everything else about this movie. I'm surprised it's rated so highly, though I'm seeing most of the the people writing such glowing reviews are... you guessed it... dudes! Recommended viewing: if you are a recovering alcoholic who feels like relapsing; a woman who was raped and feels like being triggered; an angry, white, male nerd who needs that extra push to rape and murder the chick who lives a couple doors over. This is probably the only time I'll ever write a review on IMDb, because I'm really shocked that it has a score over 4 let alone all these reviews raving about how great it is. No. This movie is terrible.Fascinating, Thoughtful, Somewhat Freaked Out I watched Ex Machina and became somewhat freaked out during the middle of it. Looking back on it, my overall emotion toward it is not a very happy one, but rather uneasy. In terms of rating, I would have trouble creating a movie with the same idea any better.  Someone said this movie was like a roller coaster, and just as soon as you approach what looks like a double loop, they slow you down and let you off. I would completely agree with this, in that the middle of the film where the plot is building momentum gets very intense. I found myself questioning how far are we, really, in today's world, towards creating such artificial intelligence.  Most of this movie is believable. I loved that about it. I didn't catch anything that seemed unreasonable. There were some parts that made me think "Wow this is so happening right now"!  I remember watching Bicentennial Man with a group of friends when it first came out. Ex Machina blows that out of the water and feels very 2015. Ex Machina is gorgeous, too. No one seems to mention how beautiful the film is. If you simply watch it for the beauty, you will be exhilarated with excitement and dream you were there (better yet, dream you actually live there!).  Oscaar Isaac does an amazing job at his role. I'm still blown away at the character development and solid performance on screen. I can't wait to see more roles from him! Can he get away from the bearded crazy short temper guy Nathan?The evolution of Science Fiction This kind of Sci-Fi is what I live for ! Thought provoking, it had me questioning my own morality and my future relevance in the evolutionary chain of life. With real life advances in robotics, 3D printing, the internet and advances in programming this Sci-Fi will be Sci-Fact in the not too distant future which the film really captures. The cast wasn't big but it wasn't really required either. The character diversity and development made the story solid and definitely worth watching several times again. Great set design and CGI gave the film believability that this could actually be occurring today in some secret location in the world. A remarkable film that I am keen to get my friends to watch and comment on the ideas it presents.Screenplay not overdone or filled with unnecessary nonsense. Beautifully photographed. Ex Machina is the best film about A.I. becoming self-aware that I have seen. I went in knowing that I would probably enjoy the film, based on Alex Garland's previous work and the actors involved. It was a creepy and futuristic subject that, if you really think about it, is a very realistic concept. The film serves as a warning of sorts. It tells us to be careful and not to let our egos get the best of us. Just because we CAN create something, does not mean that we should. The screenplay wasn't overdone or filled with unnecessary nonsense. Simply executed, beautifully photographed &amp; designed with great acting, perfect tone and a haunting score. See this now &amp; after you get home, read my feature about the viral marketing campaign and the original strategies they employed to promote it (ello.com/fromconcentrate).It's great to see Sci Fi coming back! I really didn't check up on what the outline was of this film other than seeing the Trailer for it in the theater. I took my girlfriend (She was a fan! Clock one up for Sci Fi!) to see it and was very pleasantly surprised to see how thought provoking and well made the film was. I remember drooling over the house location they shot at as a kid in "Architectural Digest" too! I am so glad to see quality Science Fiction film making a steady comeback again! I am a huge fan of Artificial Intelligence and Cyberpunk "genres" in film and print and this film is a great addition to both. I really look forward to the day a truly great dedicated Cyberpunk film comes out again as well. Congrats to the filmmakers of Ex Machina, and thank you for the great work!Foreseeable For an experienced movie fan, this movie was a beautifully composed bouquet of clich√©s. Without a doubt the camera work, and the composition of frames (in some of the cases) was really good, sometimes even great. But the story and the writing was a bit underwhelming. Since the scene where our "hero" won the "lottery" it was very suspicious. And the fact that the hole experiment was staged is so foreseeable that it really hurts... But once again... maybe I saw too many movies in this genre. The twist/twists at the end, can give the writer's a pat on the back... but even so the hype was bigger than the movie. The acting was fine, the ambiance, especially the sound was well done. It's watchable if you are not a Sci-fi fan, and it's even enjoyable if you haven't seen any movie regarding AI and android, and the rise of the machines...Worth Watching a Second Time Absolutely Brilliant! The spareness of the treatment is spot-on; it's been a long, long time since anyone has had the gumption to focus on the story and underlying thought currents like this, and I couldn't be happier. In fact I will be going to see this again, a thing I haven't had motivation to do in 20+ years. For the majority of the general audience they will be bored to death; for the audience that is willing to sit back, watch, and think this would be hard pressed to be better (and I' d be very happy to have a bevy of film makers try!). THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE ORIGIN AND CORE OF SCIENCE FICTION, which most have forgotten as they drown in shoot-em-up, amp-d up action scenes. Well Done!Poor story, only reasonable otherwise If I had realised this was by Alex Garland I would not have bothered watching. I remember reading his book the Beach years ago and thinking 'there's something not very nice about this'. At the time I wasn't sure what it was. But now having seen Ex Machina, I have the same feeling. That the story has been chosen simply to appeal to a large audience, in a rather manipulative, unthinking and unfeeling way. I don't normally write bad reviews - of anything. Preferring to focus on the positive. But I so dislike this I felt I had to write something to put people off wasting their time, or assimilating some of this 'nastiness'. In the case of Ex Machina I can just imagine Garland wondering what he would do for his next project, googling AI and quickly finding the AI Box Experiment. And rather than do the heart- and soul-searching work that would be necessary to produce anything original I imagine him quickly turning somebody else's idea into his next big proposal to present to the film studio. So an unoriginal idea, presented in a fairly pedestrian way. Lots of images derived from a young person's view of 'sexuality', made me also wonder if this film is rather prejudiced against women? It is reasonably paced but I found myself yawning a lot - not quite what I would expect from a good thriller. Domhnall Gleeson is OK, does a pretty good job.stunning and beautiful! I have been waiting for this movie for a while and the long wait has been totally worth it! Without giving too much spoilers, the movie is about the Turing Test performed by a millionaire researcher boss (Nathan) between one of his employee (Caleb) and his newly created 'female' android robot, called 'Ava'. Caleb was invited for this week- long experiment in Nathan's remote research facility. For the most part, the film revolves around a closed apartment with 3-4 major characters and with very few scenes of the outside world. The resulting claustrophobic atmosphere occupied by the omnipresent 'big brother' Nathan watching the interaction of the confused Caleb and the seductive, ever mysterious Ava makes a gripping viewing experience.  Right from the beginning when the human subject Caleb enters through the door of the apartment with the blue light ominously turning red in a somewhat foretelling fashion, there is a definite sense of uneasiness and paranoia throughout the film. There are appropriate philosophical aspects regarding how one should define intelligence or the meaning of one's emotional awareness or the foreshadowing discussion of technological singularity. Some viewers may find these philosophical conversations a bit boring, but they actually serve well to allow us have deeper glances into the character developments. Just to quote an example, Ava's wishful fanciness in watching flow of humans in a busy traffic crossing makes us slightly more curious about her. Later we come to know that this instinct of her has its roots in how 'she' has actually been created,- by studying countless human data obtained by every personal computers and mobile phones in the world.  There are some beautifully crafted moments like the Jackson Pollock painting scene, imagery in Ava's mind during the description of the thought experiment, her putting the clothes on for the first time or even the final shadow- scene. The director has equally balanced it with eeriness with scenes like Caleb's discovery of the other female androids, The look in Ava's eyes when the light goes off during the first session of the Turing Test, Kyoko's 'revelation', Ava's selection of dress and 'parts' or the chilling hint of a smile on an old android inside the closet. The chilling final twist, although have been subtly foretold in a few scenes is not something which is very obvious. The film is well supported by the acting ensemble. but, easily the top of the cast is Alicia Vikander, who excellently portrayed Ava, expressed all kinds of emotions,- from longing, love, hate, curiosity, to indifference, mostly through her eyes and she brought into the screen a 'realistic' Ava with her slow and slightly dragging feet movements as well.  There are a couple of ambiguous things which I feel the director might have thrown more hints into. For example, we do not know the true purpose of Kyoko. It is not completely clear whether she is just an android maid and a 'live' sex toy or is a new version of 'Ava' in making. More importantly, why does Caleb not feel any apparent pain when he cuts himself deeply and how the deep gushing wound seemingly healed itself or maybe he is also an android? These are things left to stretch the imagination of the viewers. But overall, in my opinion, Ex Machina makes a stunning directorial debut of Alex Garland. I will be expecting eagerly for his future projects.SPOILER Pygmalion remastered When an opportunity to make a movie about a subject that has found review in classical times presents itself, it would be marvellous to see a fresh perspective applied that defines our generation and psyche. Unfortunately I see a rehashing of the classical themes without too much challenge or interpretation. A simple reversal of genders would throw the whole balance of the idea and challenge reader and author alike, driving us to new conclusions and interpretations. As cinematically endearing as this movie is, with the final wall never being removed, it leaves question of human desire and manipulation clearly the traditional role of the sexually charged female. Where do we draw the line with that interaction? Why does the protagonist have to be male in this case. How much more interesting would a female perspective be. As much as this is a good movie it also it falls into the chauvinistic Hollywood genre where females are to blame for the fall of man. Can we be fooled or should we challenge the pre-concepts? Enjoy.A big disappointment You can judge the scale of my disappointment by the fact this is my first review here. The movie started strong and given the tension increase I was expecting a really nice outcome. But it turned into a shallow and alogical piece. Logic abandoned. Even Asimov's AI had a first unbreakable law that it couldn't hurt a human being - this should be the first thing to integrate as a rule in a AI, but hey our My Genius Creator just skips that, because it's cooler to build the AI without such clauses even though you intend to use it as a slave against its will. Come on! Nobody is that stupid, especially a genius who invents the first AI! Another very important thing to consider is the veracity of the whole development process which is presented as done by a SINGLE man, dude what, that's not even serious. What about the reason for the main antagonist to get drunk as dead every night, or is that how he invented the AI? Unbelievable and unrealistic the movie is a failure to me, sorry.Astonishing and thought-provoking. A future classic. I'm not normally moved to write reviews - many people much more knowledgeable than me can offer greater insight into the films we watch - but I'm compelled to at least try after having watched Ex-Machina last night. From the outset, I was utterly hooked. This is a nuanced, delicately ominous portrayal of one possible future that mankind may face. Some may think the film suffers from a plodding pace at times, but I viewed it as a slow-burner without the in-your-face bells and whistles that so often plague Sci-Fi. There was, to me at least, a faint impression of the foreboding and solitude that we see in The Shining, with long panning silent views of starkly beautiful vistas, the gently increasing sense of dread and the occasional corridor shot. The film works absolutely wonderfully with it's pared-down cast of just four main characters. Ava is so gently subtle, Nathan, although he tries to hide it behind a buddy exterior, smugly fancies himself as a god of sorts, Caleb grows quickly over the space of a couple of days and Kyoko has her own pivotal role. All in all this film skilfully builds paranoia upon fear, isolation upon violence to reach it's crescendo. A superb film, I hope in the future this is seen to be the classic I believe it is. I won't be happy until I get to see it again on the big screen.Its pronounced Makina not Machine-ah Yeah its a good film but to be honest the whole AI bit of it isn't what interested me. Although I'm not sure that is what was supposed to be most interesting about the film. Yes it does raise the now old question about AI and whether it is a good decision to create it. Most films about the subject do seem to indicate that it is the precursor to the end of humanity as we know it as does this film in a less scarier and less imminent way...... anyway, Its Oscar Isaac's, genius, reclusive, insane????, brilliant and often scary character that made this film a great watch for me. Domhnall Gleeson's character could have been there to try a new secret sauce for a fast food company and as long as Isaac was there looming about the house telling him about how important it was to keep the secret sauce a secret and explaining the intricacies of marketing fast food to the world and all that stuff I would probably still enjoy the film. As long as there was a dance sequence involving Isaac and some girl in a burger costume or something of course. Yes this review is weird and you should discount it at your nearest convenience. Its a good film though, watch it.Should we trust in artificial intelligence? When I started to watch the movie the movie, at first I thought that it would be another dynamic sci-fi action, but step by step I found out that the authors have made a very slow and tense drama movie on robots and artificial intelligence. The movie is about a young scientist (Domnhall Gleeson), who is hired by a billionaire (Oscar Isaac) to go to his house which is constructed among the woods and rocks to examine his invention - a female robot with artificial intelligence (Alicia Vikander). The main reason of the examination is the fact that a big proportion of human feelings and passion is injected into this robot and the latter can is capable of feeling and discussing matters like a human being. I don't wanna write something about the script as there are no harsh or abrupt events and the whole movie is a discussion around the logics and feelings, joy and disappointment. The movie is very stylish and beautiful, brilliant nature, unique scenes, bright colors. Acting is good, for me it is not a movie, that demands brilliant acting skills. Of course, there are some aspects that could be done in different way, for example the end of the movie, which was quite predictable for me. The whole movie is accompanied by a dull and tedious sound which keeps the watcher in tension, waiting for something critical.Robotic Kubrick Alex Garland (screenwriter of 28 Days Later &amp; Sunshine) delivers a tremendous and thought-provoking story with great performances from (the always great) Oscar Isaac, (the young in everything) Domhnall Gleeson, and (the wonderful) Alicia Vikander. The film is a slow burner, but when it does burn, damn! It burns bright! This film is electrifying, it's terrifying, and yet says so much about where we are heading in terms of existence and technology.  Visually, it is stunning, with gorgeous cinematography and great use of symmetry (Kubrick style), the film is beautiful to watch, and coupled with the engaging narrative, this film really does draw you in and takes you to places that leave you gasping.  It has the feel of a Danny Boyle movie, but yet Garland has placed his own stamp upon this film, even if he is slightly paying homage to his precious working relationship with Boyle.  This film will take you in and leave you thinking "what the hell happened there?" This film IS a must! 5/5 www.backtothebradshaw.wordpress.comOne of a kind Sci-Fi Ex Machina the 2014 science-fiction film to have crossed through many minds for its input on the genre. It's rare for a sci-fi film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance‚Äîbut then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor. Because whatever writer/director Alex Garland wants to say about the nature of what it means to be alive, or the very human qualities of deception and self-deception, and I'm not sure he's really saying all that much. Is not remotely as delightful as watching one of the most talented actors in the world doing his thing. Ex Machina's premise is built around the reason Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) has won an opportunity to spend a week with Nathan: Nathan needs assistance with a very special experiment. He has developed an artificial intelligence robot in female form called Ava (Alicia Vikander), but the question of whether Ava is truly sentient requires the Turing test. It's Caleb's job to spend time with Ava‚Äî her translucent limbs, skull and torso exposing the sparkling machinery beneath the surface, so as to provide a constant reminder of her synthetic nature‚Äîand ask the right questions to figure out what's going on in her man-made brain. On all fronts, the film delivers great performances, wonderful technology and is visually stunning to watch. Gleeson is the weakest link of the film and I believe to be miscast but besides his performance, Vikander and Isaac carry the film. Ex Machina isn't predictable like many films in recent memory and it keeps audiences guessing. ==================================================================== ==================================================================== After a rewatch (08/18/17') Ex-Machine is one of the better sci-fi films of the decade. Watching for a second time, one is able to notice more subtle clues and hints of the film as to where we think it may be heading. Ex-Machine is the type of film which Hollywood and major studios should be making more of, as it is a rare breed of great intellect.One of the best thrillers of the last years I was expecting a lot of this movie and it was a great experience. Firstable, the cinematography of this movie was epic, the colors, the lights and the different angles and shots. On the other hand, the production design, you feel the claustrophobic environment of the scientific research center. The performance of Alicia Vikander was excellent, she looks like a robot, speaks like a robot, acts like a robot, she was a robot. The other actors, Isaac and Gleseson did a ripping performance too. Oscar Isaac with a character not very easy to play and when you see the film you can't figure out that is Oscar Isaac. Gleeson, on the other hand, did an sterling performance, he was able to create an atmosphere inside the movie that makes you live the entire film by yourself. Ex Machina is a great film, you may feel confused and thoughtful after watching it. This will be a classic for sure and if the academy is fair will be at least nominated in some categories.Garland's vision is such that he has created something special, fresh and unique. I've now seen Ex Machina three times and you should all have seen it precisely once. I now have the ability to do a spoilers review, which will replace my hastily written at Hong Kong airport review. This movie is such a spectacular experience. It has only a four-person cast, three of whom have lines, but all of whom completely exceed hopes. Domnhall Gleeson gets the least showy but most important part - the lonely kid who is intimidated by his boss and falls so easily for this AI. His faltering smile makes him look genuinely shaken when either Ava or Nathan drop a bombshell on him. He is the conduit for the film, the only character we are able to fully understand going in, and he does it so well. Oscar Isaac gives my favourite supporting performance of last year as Nathan. Modelled on Stanley Kubrick (and you can tell with cute little homages like "I'm afraid I can't do that"), Nathan is simultaneously very warm and completely detached, very reasonable and quite intimidating, a mad scientist harbouring a God complex. They key to Nathan is that he is completely unreadable. A lesser actor in this role would have ruined the entire film.  Alicia Vikander may have won the Oscar for The Danish Girl, but as far as I'm concerned, this is the film she won for. If Isaac's performance was critical to the movie being good, Vikander's was critical to the movie being watchable. She moves slowly and cautiously, somehow able to relax her facial muscles so much that her face doesn't even look like a human face, it looks like a replica of a human face. Ava's manipulation of Caleb works purely because of Vikander's performance. She dresses herself up as a little girl in need of protection, holding her sweater sleeve cuffs shyly and holding her torn picture with quiet distress. When she breaks free, she is about as terrifying as the Terminator, with her long graceful running strides and her emotionless face as she leaves Caleb to die. Her sweet laugh as she reaches the outside world is almost enough to make you forget the dangerous and terrifying things she has just done.  Alex Garland's direction of the film is spectacular, with perfect panning shots and slow stationary camera with minimal distraction. Ava's choice of clothes - her own choices contrasted with what she knows will seduce Caleb - are vital. The incredibly entertaining dance scene in the middle of the film is not only fun, but it lowers your guard completely for what is soon to follow. The minimal use of colour and sound makes their occasional appearances harsher and almost more frightening. The film is edited to perfection, not a single frame wasted, with long scenes of discovery there for us to appreciate just as we recover from shocks that may have just taken place. The film's score - the eerily beautiful four note melody and the thundering helicopter-esque crescendo - both do much to spike the tension or drama of the scenes in which they are used. The benefits of having the writer direct is that Garland understands how important the words of the film are and so the direction is all about serving those words. Impeccable dialogue exists all throughout the film, whether philosophical discussions or character development or just the super reasonable explanations that Nathan keeps coming up with. The shocking reveals, one right after the other, are enough to have you holding your breath in shock, saying "did that just happen?" We're talking about Usual Suspects level of duplicity.  The Visual Effects team (with obvious support from makeup, production design and costumes) are the real winners of this film. The fact that they won an Oscar over Star Wars and three Best Picture nominees is the ultimate triumph of the little guy. Rewatching this film has given me an even greater appreciation for its beauty. You don't think about how difficult it would be to create Ava's see-through body and yet not impose of the background of the shot. In one scene, Ava detaches her arm. We don't even think about how they might have done that. Its all such subtle and beautiful work, and on such a small budget the filmmakers should really be commended. Then again, they all should be for making this film full stop.A cyberthriller masterpiece. This film is the most thought provoking piece of science fiction film since Blade Runner. Alex Garland brilliantly delivers a film Stanley Kubrick would have made for 5 million, and gives the audience credit by not spoon feeding themes. He puts the scenes out there, and encourages you to decide the topics for yourself. The characters are brilliant with Alicia Vikander as the android AVA giving a nuanced performance that will stun you. The Nathan character played by Oscar Isaac is a brilliant twist on the archetypal IT mogul. The visuals are a landmark and a masterclass of composition. Yes it's about thinking machines, yes it's about freewill and feminism, yes it's about the dehumanisation of the digital age. But it has so much more to offer. A must see.Intelligent and entertaining I think this was the best film I saw in 2015. It's well written, acted and directed, most of all it's good entertainment. It's an examination of gender, hubris, ownership and what it is to be human. This is all achieved in a suspenseful thriller with a good salting of sexual tension. The acting is uniformly excellent, Alicia Vikander is exquisite, the perfect human I would construct if I was god of my own world. Oscar Isaac is equally compelling as the arrogant heartless creator, while Domnhal Gleeson plays the innocent who is ensnared and duped by all the other characters. Alex Garland has a strong track record writing screen plays, here he not only writes but also directs, and with the skill of a highly regarded veteran. I look forward to his next film, in the meantime Ex Machina is worth a repeat viewing.Simple, Powerful, and Beautiful. One of the most important conditions of a great movie to me is whether I can reflect on human beings through the movie or not. Ex Machina is definitely worthy to be called a masterpiece because it is such a pretty philosophical entertainment in three respects. First, what makes human spirit. Personally, I know I am Buddhist; therefore, my perspective might be quite different from yours. However; I cannot stop asking myself how we could give AI human intuition toward something transcendental like good, beauty, and eternity. Second, whether human mind will evolve further. In the movie, the AI attained free will and strategic thinking by quick learning or evolution. If AI evolved more, could human mind (the model of AI) also evolve? If so, when and how? Finally, why people love somebody and what love is. In the movie, it seems that love between a human being and AI occurred somewhat. What are conditions of love? An attractive face and figure, sex, exchange of feelings, Sharing experience, or all of them? Perhaps, love might be illusion that we just want to believe in. After all, something we call love is everlasting mystery. I strongly believe this amazing movie would deepen or change your critical values. "Seeing is believing."Ex Machina - an intelligent (feminist!) movie for everyone Scoped the flick Ex Machina in the U.K. last night (don't think it's gone wide in the U.S. yet)  While the trailer's I've seen make it look like a popcorn flick about a sexy female robot, it is anything but - as in one well directed, intelligently researched and written story with a killer ending that I'm still pondering over (along with the overall concept and food for thought tidbits scattered throughout the duration of the movie).  Oscar Isaac's character is attractive and intriguing in equal measure, as are those of Alicia Vikander and Domhnall Gleeson. While Vikander initially provides the eye (and mind) candy, her acting talents and those of Mr Gleeson soar under the hands of an undisputed directing master that is Alex Garland. If Scott Rudin produces a film (he exec produced this one) it's definitely going to be good. And Ex Machina is no exception. To say Ex Machina is a feminist movie, or at least one that is food for thought on the future of mankind and AI, would be closer to the truth. peaceSuper Sci-Fi I really enjoyed this movie. It was well written, had good acting, some interesting plot twists and an ending that made you want more. The special effects are top-notch! If I could engineer a real robot or cyborg, this is what she would look like. Not only did they make her realistic, but she is gorgeous and evokes sexuality. I appreciate when a movie doesn't go over-the-top with technical jargon or treat the viewers as if they were stupid. Ex Machina strikes an excellent balance in that regard and should find an audience of all ages. Not full of action and pyrotechnics, but one of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen in years.The psychology of AI the spoiler is only mild and only exists at the end (warning included at that point) one of the best -if not the best- movies ever made on the topic of AI. this movie has really interesting story line which keeps the viewer engaged from the very beginning to the end and the climax is simply superb. besides the good story line, one great thing about this movie is that it explores the AI specifically very well. there are some particular things that i liked in the movie which i would like to tell in some detail: 1. i always thought google was working on developing AI, especially after they started working on google car, acquired companies like Deep Minds etc. this movie seemed to agree with me by showing that the CEO of the top (fictitious) search company secretly develops an AI. during a conversation in the movie, he tells his logic behind using the search data to develop the AI. 2. in other AI movies i think the psychology of the AI is not shown properly. eg in Terminator series, the machines didn't seem to have any psychology. whereas in Matrix series, it's mostly implied or indirectly shown but not properly explored. in the movie "A.I." again, although the main character is implied to have human like emotions- but that itself was because he was created in the 1st place to display those. so in spite of all the emotions shown there, they seem highly objective, predictable &amp; mechanical in nature. in this movie however the AI shown has almost perfect understanding of human emotions, has its own emotions &amp; feelings and can use them perfectly for some purpose. (spoiler from here) although it's shown that those things were intended by the CEO to have in the AI, it's seen in the end they didn't proceed in the predictable manner and the AI had formed it's own individuality and objectives etc. the AI also displays the characteristics of the perfect psychopath- one who has its own feelings, can understand perfectly others' psychology, use them to manipulate others very well but lacks completely feelings towards others.Fantastically Engaging From Beginning to End I watched this on VidAngel recently, and was astounded at how much I enjoyed this film. There were really only three actors and just a few locations, minimalism at its finest. In fact, this could have been made for the stage as well as it was made for the screen. At any rate, from the very first scene to the rolling of the credits I was completely intrigued. The plot, too be sure, progressed wonderfully. The pacing is excellent and the mystery held my interest throughout, with a satisfying twist at the end. But it's the character interaction that really makes this film shine. The dialogue is superb. Well crafted and realistic it makes the characters and their relationships with one another the centerpiece of this film. The characters are exquisitely defined and the acting top notch, completely drawing me into the story. Nathan and Ava are especially fascinating character studies, and long after the film had ended I found myself thinking about them and the way they were portrayed. This is a true gem of a film, and it makes me sad that it didn't attract the attention it deserves. I hope it makes up for this in its life as a DVD.If Claude Monet was a film this would be it. 10/10 Ex Machina is easily the best Sci Fi film I have come across in recent times, It captured me sucked me in and blew me away with it's intelligent way of showing the pro's and cons of Artificial Intelligence. The setting of the film was great, the imagination into the design of the Character (Ava) was a great work of art and so very believable. The triangular interaction between the focal characters was intense and it worked so well almost a love triangle, all this and with real clever and graceful acting. I got a sense of pure elegance in the way this film was made and what the director writer (Alex Garland) was trying to achieve here. I now have hope for AI films or tech in the future. To give a honest review here it's got to be without a shadow of doubt going to be one of my most favorite films of all time! I just can't compare this to any other Sci Fi films old or new but I can give a rating out of 10 and it's so very seldom I can give a film 10/10 however this one is an exception, it was a fantastic watch and deserves all the admiration and plaudits it get's. This film is a piece of art.Mind is blown (this is a movie for intellectuals, futurists, and deep thinkers) Simple an amazing movie.. You know a movie is good when it gets your biting your nails while you watch it. This movie just shot up my Sci Fi all time rankings..Truly an awe inspiring piece of film. Not going to say anymore, but if your expecting robot space wars and big action, this movie is not for you, its for people who are truly interested in the philosiphy of future technologies and AI. It is also a great story that keeps you guessing until the end. 10 out of 10Twizard Rating: 100 There are genius scripts, and then there are scripts that are obviously written by genius. Ex Machina is an example of the latter.  In this film, we get one of the most pensive takes on consciousness and science. Written and directed by Alex Garland, it takes a lot out of you, but it's worth it in the end. Looking deeply into the reality of artificial intelligence, Ex Machina follows Caleb (Domhall Gleeson), a computer coder who wins a contest to live at his billionaire boss' estate for a week. When he gets there, his boss, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), informs him that he will be part of a project to test if an artificial intelligent being can form relationships with actual humans.  One thing that Isaac excels exceptionally well at is being mysterious. Right away, we're scared of him, but not sure why, or if we're even supposed to be. He balances this eeriness while having a charisma about him. Not like Gordon Gekko, but in a way that shows the vulnerability behind his eyes. As though Isaac, too, knows of his character's vices.  The artificial human we're given is Ava (Alicia Vikander), who, other than her looks, is a real human to us. Vikander's every move and vocal inflection convinces us that she is real. And if you haven't already seen The Man from U.N.C.L.E., you may actually think she is. While many moments in this film will leave you thinking that it would be well suited as a '90s Sci-Fi Channel film, others will let you know that this film belongs in mainstream popular culture in every way. The only downfall of this movie is that it's so dark it isolates itself from its audience. It hits home, but makes us want no part of it. It tells of too many potential truths. Too many horrors. It's one thing watching I, Robot, but it's another to make us believe that somewhere out there, someone is making an artificially intelligent being who may soon walk this earth. It's a fantastic watch, and a phenomenal movie, but not one I would soon repeat. Twizard Rating: 100Movies as they should be Since there are some good and much longer reviews out already, I want to sum my personal impression of this movie up in short: This movie is a true gem with an intelligent, realistic and highly interesting concept translated into a simple, yet fantastic story. It contains logical dialogs and sound actions of the characters. The special effects are solid and fit into the whole thing. The actors are great and totally convincing with a stunningly beautiful main female character.  In comparison to a lot of other movies praised by critics and audiences alike in the recent years, this one really sticks out for me. There is no single minute wasted for nonsense or to please that kind of audience for which the main plot and basic style of the movie wasn't made. This is a huge plus these days, because these compromises to the current teenage and studio mainstream ruined a lot of the otherwise promising productions lately... Congratulations to the film makers and highly recommended.Out of this world Ex Machina was like an experience to me, I felt so engaged into the movie, the suspense of the generator turning off with the beeping sound gave me a "frightening" feel as if I was in the movie.  The dialogue of the movie was brilliant and reached the dramatic and scientific feeling that the movie was providing, Nathan's mansion/facility also gave the movie an isolated yet relaxing feel to add to the movie's drama. The way that Alex Garland (the director) expressed AI (artificial intelligence) was very precise and smart leading to a lot of confusion and turn arounds between Eva, Nathan and Caleb. Ex Machina showed a great example of cyborgs, robots, etc... interacting with humans in a more "formal" way instead of having one of those moments filled with non-sense action senses however, the way the movie expressed a moment when the machine goes against the human in a disturbing way such as at the end when Eva tricked Caleb using love into letting her out of her cell and to trick Kyoko into attacking Nathan so Eva can kill him, and the way that Eva walked out of the mansion/facility leaving her "love" Caleb locked in Nathan's room with no way out shows that the movie used a smart disturbing turn around with no one expecting it. Ex Machina is the perfect movie. When I finished it, I got off my seat and said to myself "yup I want to become a movie director" because the movie got me thinking about life, it got me wanting to use aspects of this film into my own imagination and publishing using the same style that the movie provided, the film also got me imagining how life would be in Nathan's hands, excluding his alcoholic desires, just imagine, living in the mountains, in a futuristic style mansion working with/on cyborgs. Ex Machina should truly be a Sci-Fi classic.Derivative and deeply misogynistic Ex Machina is not only an exceedingly derivative and misogynistic movie, it is anti-Semitic one. 29 Days Later is amazing; this movie is disturbing (and not in any useful and contemplative way). Spoilers: setting: stunning Mother Nature with "amniotic" water everywhere. Characters: two male gods, lily white &amp; swarthy, encased in their safe from super nature goddess tiny house. Swarthy god is brilliant, yet can't be trusted &amp; is drunk most of the time, lily white god will save the damsel AI, who looks about 14 &amp; is see-through except for her breasts, rear end, &amp; baby face. Never mind the gratuitous display of female bodies as only bodies (shaved in all the "right" places), consciousness in this movie is apparently being able to sexually trick a man into letting a woman out of her man-created cage. Men also come off terribly in this movie; however, they are not the victims, they are the "serial killer" and the "white knight." Garland is seeming rather Bible-centric in that Ex Machina is like a weird twist on the Adam &amp; Eve narrative. It has nothing to do with AI and nothing to do with a "war of the sexes." One can't have a war of the sexes if one of the sexes is not in fact human and a prisoner.Predictably boring, with actors that shouldn't be allowed to act This is by far one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life; Heck, if somebody wanted me to suggest a sci-fi movie for them, i would rather suggest them "War of the worlds", as it's not that painful to watch as Ex Machina. I fell asleep 3 or 4 times in the movie, whilst not being tired. It was this boring and dull. Honestly, WHY IN THE FLYING "DUCK" WOULD YOU ALLOW Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac to act??? Remove those two+ fire the writers, you could maybe have a decent movie I don't think there is anything else to say, I feel sorry for myself and all the other people that wasted almost 2 hours of their life on watching such garbage.
Let down by poor script, confused tone By the third time a helicopter flew into view, I was exhausted, and dreaded the prospect of yet another interminable and unconvincingly rendered crash scene.  The plot was an unappealing mess of recycled ideas. This film brings us yet another revenge story about someone who shares history with Bond but has since turned evil. That was precisely the plot of the last movie - and rather like the last three Star Trek films, most Batman films, the Superman reboot, this year's Avengers, etc. Like last time, the stakes are raised by nebulous and non- frightening, yet world threatening (so we are told, but never shown) computer network technology.  The film once again focuses on the question: "are spies still relevant?" I don't find that to be an interesting premise for a Bond film. Why not just assume that the answer is 'yes' and make a fun and smart action movie with a heart? Casino Royale nailed this. If you really must cover the question of whether your main character is relevant, then at least deal with it once and accept the answer! In Skyfall we learned that you still want a man in the field. In this movie, we learn that you still want a man in the field (and, in case anyone was still not getting it, poor Ralph Fiennes in his role as a flaccid M spells it out literally). While I liked both actors involved, I didn't care for the romance - the movie desperately wants to build it up to be something more than an just another Bond girl. That is an admirable idea, but since the result pales in comparison to the stellar romance in Casino Royale, it seems totally unconvincing when Bond sacrifices his entire career for her at the end. Holy moly - Bond settles down? For THIS girl? What an ending to Craig's character arc that started with Vesper's death (so much more meaningful than anything in any of the other Craig Bond films). Bam, all his emotional problems are solved, because he met a hot blonde. "I've got something better to do than all this!" (throws gun away, gets into car with whatshername). Gee, great ending. All the interesting plot developments from Casino Royale and (and even Quantum of Solace to some extent), such as Bond's emotional state after losing Vesper and the Quantum organization, are chucked out the window. Skyfall discarded Quantum in favor of a good idea (Bond/M son/mother relationship) and a bad one ("is MI6 still relevant?"). Now, Quantum is back... Kinda. This time, it forms no threat at all - you see, it turns out this OTHER organization that THIS movie is about is even moar powerfuller. And it was really this other, super duper evil organization all along. Muahaha! That is a tiresome plot twist if ever I've seen one. It completely missed the mark for me; it's weak to try and make your own plot look better by retroactively stating that all villains of the previous movies were really just pawns in this guy's game of chess. And that's not the only aspect of Bond history that is severely diminished by this film. In Skyfall, we learned about Bond's youth, spent with an old Scottish dude named McAngus. I think. And, of course, his relationship with M. This time, however, it turns out that Bond actually grew up in the Bavarian Alps with a couple of yodeling Germans named Oberhausen. Errr? Am I the only one confused here? (Possibly.) Bond turns out to have a sort of surrogate brother, who is very blond, very German, and very jealous. Oh and he also happens to be a supervillain, with an enormous army, who somehow managed to stay absolutely hidden for all these years. There is a powerful and compelling reason for his having all these skills and resources: it's convenient for the plot. And so, all previous Bond movies are reduced to one large scam operation, a plan by an Alpine superhero that makes absolutely no sense, in a failed attempt to give this movie a great villain. Christoph Waltz is a joy to watch, but he is never allowed to be a real threat. The man gets little to work with, as did Javier Bardem in the last one - criminally underused, awesome actors. The film's tone was confusing. There is one gruesomely violent scene involving eyeballs - I don't enjoy seeing such aggressive violence, although here I seem to be in a vanishingly small minority. Call me old fashioned, but I was always happy that Bond films used polite violence: gentle fist fights until one guy faints, or perhaps someone shoots a gun and somewhere else, far away, someone falls to the floor. Putting my personal feelings aside, it was jarring to have this scene be followed up by a cartoonish fist fight on a train, after which the eye-ripping guy is yanked out of a train by a rope, but not before realizing his predicament like Wile E. Coyote hanging over the ravine and saying "shit!". Is this a corny spy movie with train fights a la Bond vs Jaws? Where Bond leisurely glides a crashing airplane around for a few minutes and then humorously lands precisely on top of the bad guy's car? Or is it a somber drama about an aging man's career in a time when nobody knows whether spies are still relevant? Or does it want to be a raw, violent gangster film like Goodfellas, reveling in the sight of bad guys proving their credentials by maiming others? Finally, I found the camera work jarring in many action scenes - shaky cam, etc. This may have been (partly) due to my sitting in the fourth row, though.Ronald Bond This movie is somewhat watchable if you manage to convince yourself that the hero is Ronald Bond, brother of the more famous and successful James Bond. Ronald of course, unlike his brother, is not the suave charmer and rascal type, but has more of a polish wrestler look and demeanor. This makes for some light comedy when Ronald is shown to be one of the few men that can't look smart and elegant wearing a suit, which incidentally only make him look more silly and distinctly out of place. Ronald also has to rely on fools luck more than skill and intelligence to save his ill conceived ways of handling things. At the start of the movie for instance, he manages to raze two entire blocks of houses whilst trying to perform the simple task of taking out a bad guy with a snipers rifle. Not only that, but he also manages to miss the intended target. He then proceeds to chase said villain into a helicopter that takes off and flies around over a huge crowd of people. Unlike his brother James, who would simply have disposed of the bad guy and then asked the pilot to land at some convenient location, Ronald finds it a good idea to also try and take out the pilot at the same time although should he succeed, the heli would undoubtedly crash into the crowd. Fools luck saves him this time though. We get another show of his ineptness later on when he escapes out of a window. Since the bad guys chasing him would have no option but to follow him the same route, his brother would undoubtedly just turned around, wait for them to exit and them pick them off one by one with his Beretta. Ronald here of course just continues running and tries to speed off in his car resulting in a car chase. Fortunately someone must have called in a bomb threat because the city, Rome, is almost completely devoid of people. I know this, because I have been in Rome, and there's people and cars everywhere. Later on when a woman he has, like only an idiot can, fallen in love with at first site gets kidnapped by bad guys he proceeds to go after them in an aeroplane. His brother would of course just kept his distance, landed close to where the kidnappers cars stopped, and then snuck over to take care of business. Not so Ronald, he proceeds to attack them with the plane itself, seemingly without a plan. After failing miserably, as predicted, the plane crashes through a wood. Sheer luck however, not skill, eventually makes it so that he ends up at the same place as the baddies, most of them disposing of themselves in a crash, and thus lets him save the girl. Ronalds plan for the end game has to be seen to be believed. After finding out somehow where the bad guy has his bad guy compound, Ronalds plan is simple; even though the villain knows his name, what he looks like and who he is, he will just go there, waltz right in, hope to be taken to the villain, tell him that he has come to kill him, and then do so. That's it, that's the whole plan. For some reason bringing a girl along also seems like a good idea. The villain first does the obvious to thwart this "plan": send someone to dispose of this idiot en route. When this fails (on a train, incidentally also most likely bomb threatened, because like Rome before it, it's empty) this villain changes his mind for some reason, and instead of shooting the fool right in the face on sight when he arrives, proceeds to house him, give him a guided tour of his lair and then hit him over the head and torture him for a while whilst revealing some back story so ridiculous it must have had the writers rolling on the floor with laughter. One can't help wonder what Ronalds contingency plan was throughout all this.  The plot on it's whole is incomprehensible and stupid, apparently all the intelligence agencies in the world are about to pool into one giant data base that NONE of all the experts that thus must have been involved, with all their vast resources, have managed to find out is controlled by the bad guy. Incidentally, on the plus side, the bad guy also turns out to be an idiot who makes it only through luck. (watch how he miraculously survives not only the explosion of a hand grenade type watch (don't ask) thrown at him, but also the explosion of his whole bad guy hideout. (no explanation is of course given as to how he managed this) There's a fun sequence near the end that can only work if we assume that said bad guy spent some time printing out Ronald Bonds passport photo, as well as those of various friends and colleagues of his, and spent what must have been a considerable amount of time walking around a building taping these up presumable to unnerve Ronald when he arrives there. He also apparently went out to buy a spray can so the could spray "Bond" and an arrow on the wall. The latter implies that his plan actually hinged on the certainty that Bond would escape from the henchmen that captured him earlier on. There is however nothing that shows that the henchmen were intended to let him go so that he could reach this target, so why anyone would bother with the printing, spraying and taping when the odds of Ronald Bond actually getting there are extremely slim, is any ones guess. All great fun though but watching James Bonds brother clown and clumsy his way through an adventure like this makes one long for an actual James Bond movie, it has been too long!Mediocre and overbudgeted ! Despite an initial action scene full of CGI that you can also experience in the trailer, this movie hasn't got too much to offer. The main problem is the bad script and dialogs and the pretentious style which tries to keep the tradition of older Bond films incorporating some not-so-witty and clich√© humor and ludicrous action sequences with nothing new to offer. Planes, helicopters, cars...Well we've seen it all before and in much better executions. Also Blofeld (or should I say BLOWfeld), despite the fact he is the King of all previous villains, seems quite harmless. Casino Royale (2006) is far more entertaining (I've watched it again recently) and engaging. Spectre is "Meh!" in almost every department including (unfortunately) the ladies. Thomas Newman who serves as the composer of the film, is proved to be a bad decision too. At the beginning he tries to revive the good-old 007 theme in almost every scene and the outcome is sub-par to say the least. Later he replaces the music with the same note again and again (da-da-da-da-da-da-da). David Arnold did a great job in C.R. and should have been the composer in this too (although I doubt that he could save this movie). And what's the deal with this lame song? Unsuitable for a Bond movie or any movie out there. Same goes for the same-o same-o intro sequence. The combination of these 2 makes it look like it was made by Liberace. Overall: The whole movie is pale like the Pale King it mentions.Save your money this is a rental (if you must see it) Before I unload my barrage of critique against this film I would like to first state something. Whenever I watch a movie, and I have so many issues with it, I will take a step back and ask myself for what it is, is it at least a good action movie? The answer is no, it is not. Good things about the movie:  High production quality and some good visuals / The intro sequence before the helicopter **SPOILERS BELOW** -AVERT YOUR EYES!- Problems with the movie:  1) You kill a bad guy, bad guys organization wants to kill the wife cause she's a loose end, Bond prevents the assassins, she finds out Bond killed her husband, then... she sleeps with him immediately. What? Sure she didn't love her husband but with all the stuff going down and after a powerful organization sends 2 assassins they have time to take a break and get busy? (possibly Assassins come in pairs and more arrive only after 30 minutes enough time to shag)  2) WASTED TALENT. 2a) Christoph Waltz. Such a great actor, with a horrible script. At the beginning they make him out to be a bada$$ in the shadows requiring to whisper things to underlings who then announce it to the rest of the group at a meeting. But then he randomly talks on his own because he can, and even has time to say hello to Mr. Bond in the crowd just as Bond realizes he's been caught, and manages to escape bumbling security guards. They attempted to make Waltz' character this mastermind who I was never afraid of, and he wasn't that menacing. For the leader of one of the most powerful organizations his master plans came off weak and his ruthlessness tame. 2b) Dave Bautista. They used him pretty good with his introduction and a fight scene in the movie, but the car chase scene was horrible. Bond was essentially talking to moneypenny on the phone about bad guys rap sheets while Bautista's character was chasing him down in a car (but he was more following Bond then attempting to shoot him or run him off the road). At one point during the chase scene Bautista pulls up next to bond and is looking at Bond and their eyes meet up... and nothing happens Bond pulls ahead. Is this a love story between two men or is this a bada$$ car chase scene where the bad guy is trying run him off the road/pound him into the ground?  3) This film has max level cheese that at times I could have sworn this movie was written by Bollywood writers. I don't mind a decent amount of cheese, but if you're piling it on and the expiry date shows 10 years ago there's a problem. 3a) Helicopter intro Scene 3b) save the girl or building blows up scene 3c) Bonds helicopter chasing vehicle convoy  4) Boring car chase and fight scenes (with camera tricks to make it look more epic which i'm not a fan of and its as bad as lens flares)  5) Bond falls in love with a woman he hardly knows (it didn't feel believable) but that's OK because he's ready to leave his life as a spy 6) The story felt all over the place, and at times Bond is purposely made to look weak and suddenly drinks a RedBull and tears it up 007 style. I didn't really connect with a lot of the characters either. 7) The instant you saw Bond towering over the enemy at the end you already knew he wasn't going to do anything they gave you obvious clues earlier on through M thats how it was going to play out. I couldn't even disconnect myself from the flaws just to enjoy it as an action movie since it was overall boring. If you can't connect with the story, 2.5 hours is way too long for a few flashy scene's.A truly unexciting 'action' movie This is the worst Bond movie ever, filled with emotionless characters that I couldn't care less about. The pace of this film after a predictably exciting start is slow and boring. Unlike his fellow actors, Ben Whishaw as Q manages to portray the only believable human in this whole fake production. Why couldn't JB have been given a touch of Q's wit, humour or vulnerability? No wonder Daniel Craig wants out of this franchise - it's beneath his talent. Such a cacophony of totally forgettable dialogue, people and silly stunts is hard to imagine in a single movie and yet here it is. During one of the 'action' fights when James was being hammered by the evil assassin I noticed the person next to me had fallen asleep and was snoring. That person was an exceedingly eloquent critic.Dressed up as a 10, but contains a 1 What I resented most about this movie was a complete lack of originality, a plot line that all-so conveniently connects everything together from the last Craig movies, making this one sound like it's clever when it's just easy to say. It's a total fake, an unoriginal, a fraud. Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful to look at, but it's empty. Absolutely empty. Where it tries to be clever, it comes up empty. Basically, they slapped the name Bond on it, said that everything was somehow conveniently connected to one another (how brilliant! sigh :/ ) and dress it up with beautiful cinematography. One of the worst films I've ever seen. Predictable and whenever they tried to make something significant, it ended up being oh so silly.I understand why Daniel Craig doesn't want to do another Bond. This is one of the worst Bond films. There was some good cinematography and an all star cast, but just God awful plot and story telling. I don't recommend seeing it. I like all of Craig's Bond films, except this one. Actually, Craig is my favorite Bond actor. In the previous Craig films, they did a good job of using ancillary characters like M, Q and Moneypenny to augment his character so that that his missions seemed logically paced and not solely center on his prowess alone. They deviated from the traditional Bond by allowing him to have Blonde hair, who had a an experience worn face and body that did break down from wear and tear, who was detail oriented and mission driven.  While this film still tried to keep to it's current trend, it reverted back to just stupid unrealistic scenes, like Bond shooting SMG's with one hand from 200 yards out and saying clever one liners like "You're bluffing," I lost track of how many helicopters were used in this film. How many times was bond apprehended and somehow able to break his 'bonds' from his captors and escape the villain's carefully planned exotic methods of execution? And it was 2.5 hours long; plus the editing made no sense of how they got from point A to point B. They could've at least had the villains die in extreme and weird ways, but no, a total let down even on that point.  This is a first time I've written a review and encouraged the audience members not to see this film. It reminds me the Die Another Day film with Pierce Bronson which was terrible, but they squeezed it in because he only had one film left on his contract. Forgivable, Yes, but I hope the producers have something better for the next Bond film seeing as they are pacing these releases 2.5 years apart, which a tight deadline.B for boring, very very boring. Wonder what the refund policy is at Premier Theaters. Of course they are not responsible for this fiasco. It just went on and on and on......plot meandering went nowhere...actors mumbling...no suspense, just one predictable scene after another. Some of the scenes looked like they were shot on my grandpa 8mm Kodak movie camera. And to boot, the "reality" of the fight scenes would meet a standard of a 5 year old. We all know this is not a documentary, but when Bond / Craig get pummeled by the bad guy on the train and his tie stays in place and he suffers not a scratch or a black eye where is the realism...The Islander aircraft flying with its wings clipped outboard of the engines?????.Come on Broccoli team - is this the best you can do? Sean Connery is rolling his eyes and chuckling at the new low in Bond movies. Wasted evening, could have snoozed on a couch instead of a movie theater. Now, let us face it..10 lines of comments on this almost two and a half hours of boredom is a task that even Sam Mendez could not master.Tedious and overblown. Skyfall was superb so this had a lot to live up to and it doesn't. There are so many loopholes; Q was afraid of heights so how can he go in ski lift, London is very busy day and night so how can a helicopter crash into a bridge next to the houses of parliament when it is deserted, how does a car drive up a snow covered steep mountain side without skidding, why do the walls of railway carriages brake up like pieces of flimsy cardboard during a fight ? Etc. Then there is the quite gratuitous violence ( i.e. gouging a man's eyes out.) Plus the ridiculous shoot outs where Bond fells 50 other gunmen who all seem to be very poor shots. Which brings me to the plot - what plot ? This was so convoluted that it seems to have been made up as they went along. I had enough after the first hour but wanted to see how it ended - poorly. This film compares very poorly to either Hit-man or Bourne; Sam Mendies seems now to be the director to avoid. I am sure this film will make a fortune but as the saying goes "If million people like a stupid thing - it is still a stupid thing."Bond with and IQ of 2 I went into this movie blank.I had never seen any trailer, or read any of the reviews about it. But I was bored throughout the entire movie.I felt i was watching one of those 60-70's bond with the dated lines and the tiresome old clich√©s.And they are endless. As someone else in her put it,you feel like you're watching Austin powers instead. ************warning spoilers************spoilers*****************spoilers I mean you understand from the very beginning that his new boss is working for the enemy. And when the bad guys always find him wherever he goes,you sort'a know right away it's the tracker MI6 put in his body,that helps the bad guys. I felt I was watching a kid movie,with a plot written by a dilatant. Go watch true lies instead,much better movie,with better action. After watching this I get why Craig is tired of bond,cause this script is really baddull , long, no direction ,mess i love james bond,I've seen all the films, and i can say this is the worst one, dull , meandering script, at times i had no idea what the plot was. lots of confusiion ,SPOILER ALERT: like aeroplanes appearing from no where,daniel craig didn't appear to act at all, just the same bemused face all the way through, im surprised he doesn't want to do any more.there are good stunts, car chases, fights, but lots of boredem, and often i was lost, the side story of oo dept being scrapped was just annoying, often extra would disappear completely, i wouldn't recommend this film to anybody. if james bond ahdnt been in it, id thinkit was a b movie made for TVAn Action Spectacle Showing The Vulnerability Of 007 If there was anything we learnt from 'Skyfall' it's that Sam Mendes can make a damn good Bond film, veering away from the over-the-top, explosive nature of the franchise, and focusing more on Bond's personal life and his vulnerability. Well what can be said? He did it again. 'Spectre' will definitely appeal more to those who were fans of the early films in the franchise, most notably 'You Only Live Twice' whose inspiration brings back one of the finest villains to ever face Bond. Mendes has since seemed to take a new direction on Craig's series of films and led away from the gritty, thriller aspect that 'Casino Royale' and 'Skyfall' had and instead propelled the film as an action spectacle, full of beautifully orchestrated stunts, stunning cinematography and non-stop explosive action. The locations are stunning, the score is exhilarating and the cinematography from Hoyte Van Hoytema is dazzling. Christoph Waltz and Dave Bautista, whoever the casting director was on this film, you deserve a huge pat on the back, this film stars two of the most perfect actors to plays villains ever. The much-loved Austrian Waltz whose Colonel Hans Landa has earned him recognition as a fantastic and plausible villain, and ex-wrestler Bautista proving that he is one person not to screw with. 'Spectre' manages to reflect back upon its predecessors in the franchise with references to prior villains, allies and lovers, further drawing upon a story that was in need of a conclusion, a conclusion all fans just couldn't wait for. But... will 'Spectre' be the conclusion we expected? Or will there be more to follow from Daniel Craig and 007? Obviously you don't have to take my word for it, I'm just a mega- Bond fan, but allow me to shed some light upon it if you are having a hard time deciding whether to see it or not? I went and saw this in IMAX - I was blown away. This is the ultimate British action film and one of the finest instalments!Worst Bond Movie ever... how do they fill 2.5 hours with Nothing! This is truly truly awful... now at the outset I have to say Im a HUGE BOND FAN... I cannot believe how dull this movie was... both Daniel Craig and Sam Mendes both must have 007 Fatigue as they both 'phone this in' I know when writing reviews you have to be careful not to add spoilers.. but guess what, there aren't any.. as nothing happens for 2.5 hours... just lots of overly long scenes of people talking or walking down hallways or driving in the desert... God only knows what they spent the $250 million on.. maybe a really good catering truck... Id like to go into depth of how dull this is, but Im too sleepy... . Where do I line up to get those 2.5 hours of my life back... the only thing I can say is that this movie makes Quantum of Solace look REALLY good....Mendez and Craig new milestone Worst Bond Movie Ever !!! Avoid it !! James Bond or Agent 007 has been since it beginning in books and specially in movies the standard male fantasy. He can seduce any women, practice every sport and win, drink as much as he wished and never get drunk, live all the fashion. drive the best cars (preferable Aston Martin) or any other vehicle (like jets, Helicopters, boats) and fight and kill any enemy without regret. The Regan era; and sadly most of his followers; consider the emblematic British spy as a piece of crap and decided to moralize it; both Timothy Dalton movies kisses required an AIDS test. Luckily Pierce Brosnan's Bond was somewhat a back to the origins. He smiled and made jokes;, seduced women, drink and kill when necessary; but some Hollywood asshole and a few absurd critics; decided it was becoming a parody and wanted for Jason Bourne style. A killer without personality looking for vengeance.  Those critics; obviously did not know or even care to understand that Bond's movies were meant for entertainment and never to be taken seriously. It gave us the people who lived and suffered the Cold War; some hope that WW III will not happen. But; the people who control movie industry decided to think for the people and very little care about public want.  So they created this monster. Daniel Craig's Bond is basically a tortured person looking for vengeance. Humor is gone; and it is hard to believe a person without any kind of charisma could seduce anybody or even have any friend. His previous three movies; had at least a decent action scenes that compensated somehow for the lack of fun in the full movie; but this time Mendez and Craig decided to ruin everything for everybody. The peak of the movie is the short sequence before the titles. It is somewhat original (at least the helicopter part); but nothing after that comes even closer to be entertaining. To make matters worse; Tom Cruise's MI-Rogue Nation; has basically the same script. In fact Cruise's self righteous movie has infinite more humor and ten times more action than this absurd drama. Mendez who did a good thing with Javier Barden in the previous movie; waste in this one group of outstanding actors never letting do anything interesting. Christoph Waltz has little change to become an interesting villain and whenever he is able to show his charisma; something stupid happens (who has the stupid idea of making them foster brothers ?). Monica Bellucci is there for no reason. L√©a Seydoux could have been replaced for a cardboard; since her chances to act are minimal. Ralph Fiennes looks bored in his short screen time; obviously because his character is not interesting at all. As I stated before; in terms of action; aside from the first scene; there is not much more.  There are a car and plane chase that is interesting. a car chase that is too simple and too dark to enjoy, a few clich√©d fights with Dave Bautista and others, a few shootings and an explosion at the end that is simple cheap. None of the action pieces makes a lot of sense and do not take more than half hour in total; so the other two hours of the movie are basically bad acting (Craig with this stone face), terrible dialog (everywhere) and a few postal shots of a train in the desert. It is obvious the movie was troubled when start and director; after making history on create the most successful Bond ever; both want to quit. Why they accepted, other than contractual obligations and a paycheck, are beyond my knowledge; but does not justify this disaster. We the public do not deserve this type of insult. In brief; a very bad movie that you should avoid and let the producers know this is not the kind of cinema we are willing to see.A dull pointless movie. I was finding it incredibly hard to stay awake through this movie. Even the action scenes were quite lacklustre. I think it had nothing to do with the big budget special effects but more to do with the emotionless performance of Daniel Craig's James Bond. Whenever anything exciting happened he acted like he didn't even care. He may do this every day but I can't believe it would ever get old or boring. In between the action scenes there were intense periods of nothingness. It's not surprising really as there was no real plot. I just cannot watch a mindless film about fighting, explosions and getting laid when there's no passion. Speaking of passion the "bond girls" were a big disappointment and had no connection with Bond. It was not believable and super awkward. I know when I've just faced a life or death situation that's exactly the point when I can't resist hooking up with some random. It's such an old concept and it might be time for the Bond series to be put to bed.A thrilling spectacle that ties together the Bond of old with the new. Whether you like Daniel Craig as Bond or not, you can't deny he has been an integral part of the series' highest points. Casino Royale is one of the greatest action thrillers ever, let alone Bond movie, and Skyfall is right up there with Goldeneye as a quintessential Bond adventure. Following the magnificent Skyfall, Spectre had some huge shoes to fill, and for the most part, it delivers exactly what you'd expect. An attention-grabbing, tense opening fight scene, a lovely title sequence (whether the song is good is debatable), and an elaborate sinister plot surrounding James Bond that puts him up against his inner demons more than ever. Does it surpass Casino Royale or Skyfall? Definitely not, but as far as reintroducing the villainous organization SPECTRE into Bond canon after 40+ years, the film does more than a serviceable job, giving us a stylish action-adventure to boot. SPECTRE is revealed to have been affiliated with some of Bond's biggest threats - Mr. White, Le Chiffre, Raoul Silva - all under the control of one puppeteer, the head of SPECTRE and James' archnemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. It isn't much of a spoiler, as speculation was rampant ever since the first trailer (and hell, when the name of the movie was released). What's important is its execution, and Spectre leaves breadcrumbs for you to follow all the way through the belly of the beast. Not only is Bond under SPECTRE's crosshairs, but MI6 itself is experiencing a merger led by Max Denbeigh (Andrew Scott) who wants to eliminate the 00 division and focus solely on global intelligence. It's apparent early on that Blofeld has eyes everywhere, and while he works primarily in the shadows (Christoph Waltz only having 20 or so minutes of screen time), he poses a looming threat to Bond because of his sheer cunning and a past secret that unravels itself when the two finally meet. Many parts of the film feel like a throwback to classic Bond. The icy environments, the car chase and gadgetry, the use of a massive threatening henchman, a train fight that is heavily reminiscent of From Russia With Love, and of course the modern birthing of Bond's greatest adversary. The acting all around is fantastic, with Craig continuing to impress as the suave womanizing secret agent. Thomas Newman turns in another wonderful musical score. But perhaps the most impressive feature is Sam Mendes' directing. The shots in this movie are absolutely gorgeous - the action scenes are incredible to watch and easy to follow, the landscapes are fresh and vibrant, and even the simplest of scenes - Bond and Blofeld walking up to each other for the first time - are quietly introspective yet palpably tense. Tension lingers throughout every moment of Spectre even when not much is happening, and the suspense is high enough to hold your interest for the full 2-and-a-half hours. Spectre is not perfect. Much of what happens narratively is predictable, a few lines don't go over too well in context, and you eventually find something out about Blofeld that is pretty ridiculous taking previous Bond canon into account. Also, given Waltz's reputation for knocking villainous roles out of the park, he's noticeably underused here. But these flaws don't tarnish the pure entertainment value to be had. What you want in a James Bond movie is over-the-top action surrounding the world's greatest spy who's up against unbeatable odds yet still comes out on top thanks to his charisma and general badassery, and this is precisely what Spectre delivers. Daniel Craig may or may not return as Bond, and if he doesn't, this movie serves as a perfect send-off. But as the series constantly reminds us, "James Bond will return...," and Spectre is just another welcome chapter in the immense story of everybody's favorite super spy.Not a masterpiece - but an entertaining love letter to the classic Bond films peppered with a healthy dose of irony First off, let me get something out of the way here: I like to be entertained. Entertainment, as we all know, comes in different shapes and sizes; it can be smart, profound, intellectually stimulating and so forth ‚Äì or it can just be escapist fun. Now what kind of entertainment you expect from a James Bond film is up to you; as for me, I go with fun. Regrettably, the last three 007 instalments fell a bit short in that department (at least for my taste), and since I expected this new film to be more of the same, I didn't exactly get my hopes up.  Well, I can only say I was pleasantly surprised (although judging from most reviews here, I seem to be in the minority). Instead of further exploring the somewhat dark, dramatic route the previous three films took - which, I must admit, worked very well in Casino Royale - Spectre unexpectedly goes in the exact opposite direction. Sam Mendes and John Logan apparently came to the conclusion that it was time to bring back one of the most crucial ingredients for Bond's success with audiences over the years: the fun. Don't get me wrong; it's not suddenly ALL fun and games for Her Majesty's finest spy (and Craig still portrays him as a character driven by inner rage) - but the new film is a virtual celebration of the whole James Bond universe, from past to present, including the less grounded and over-the-top elements from the older films. In fact, after a stand-out intro sequence in classic fashion, the spy with a license to kill takes us on a ride which - tonally - feels like travelling back in time to the glory days of such classics as You Only Live Twice, Goldfinger or From Russia With Love (and it's a ride back in time in more senses than one). This is supposed to be a spoiler-free review, so I won't go into any of the story details, but what unfolds after the introduction plays like a combination of the more grounded, serious Bond we've come to associate with Daniel Craig's films, and the more self-aware spy-romps of the Roger Moore era. It's a mix that doesn't always work and tone and pacing can be a bit uneven at times (especially during the third act), but Spectre largely succeeds in paying homage to many of the classic Bond films while still delivering the gritty action people come to expect from the newer instalments and staying true to the character Craig has so successfully made his own. And despite all the references and callbacks to classic 007 adventures, Spectre still manages to continue the storyline of the three previous films. So while his second entry in the world's longest living franchise is far from a perfect film, I believe Sam Mendes achieves exactly what he wants: he intentionally embraces the old Bond formula, but he also plays with it, twists it and introduces new story elements.  So my verdict: Spectre is a love letter to the classic Bond films, and while it might not be the masterpiece many people seem to have expected, there is a lot to enjoy here. It's a solid, almost classic Bond film with insane action, great set-pieces and a fantastic cast; upon first viewing, I'd rate it 7 stars out of 10. Rare Film Gems For Cinephiles: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Specter brought back the roots of James Bond As a die hard fan of James Bond, I found this film to be simply nothing more than a classic. For any original James Bond fan, you will simply enjoy how the producers and Sam Mendes re-emerged the roots of James Bond. The roots of Spectre, Blofield and just the pure elements of James Bond that we all miss even from the gun barrel introduction. This film deserves higher ratings in my view. I don't want to spoil the film , but I am finally glad the writers brought back the roots of James Bond. A true fan nothing more nothing less. I don't know what else to expect from a James bond film and Spectre does just what I originally expected in a James Bond film. It opens a whole new extension to have many more films to come. The cast does a superb in their roles and many salutes to Christopher Waltz in his enemy role.A Treat for Veteran Fans Spectre may be receiving mixed reviews within the community, but I believe that this is simply credited to the fact that Spectre differs from the other Craig Bond films like Casino Royale and Skyfall. This latest installment, in my own opinion, tips the hat to the old Bond-style of action that we loved in most of the earlier films. Granted it is not as brash as say Goldfinger, with character names such as Pussy Galore. But it doesn't exactly fit into the box of Daniel Craig's films either. This movie tells a story. It isn't just nice suits, and cars with beautiful woman surrounded by flying bullets in front of the canvas of a massive explosion (even if this film does boast the record for the largest stunt explosion in movie history). No, this movie gives us some nice character development. With a nod to the many years of Bond that has preceded Craig. It was a nice feeling to think that as a Bond fan across the the entire Franchise, that I was privy to some knowledge and little Easter eggs that maybe some of the newly converted fans (those that have joined the agency only since Craig assumed the 00-status) may not have caught on too. The only downside I could see anyone pointing out with this film is maybe the length of the film. This film could be reviewed as a rather long one, especially to those who might lose interest trying to involve themselves in a story that started back in the days of Connery. But if you are a fan of the entire franchise spanning across all 24 films, maybe even some of Flemming's original novel, then Spectre is a must see.It was..... some fourth form of 'bad' Dialogues are no where near the standard of a Bond movie. Dave Bautista, I truly don't understand the need of his role in the whole movie. A Psycho who has a .50 cal Double Barrel Pistol is unable to handle a girl. WOW. The ending... It's ruthlessly, awfully, childishly produced. The way the 'Literal King of Villains' is taken down is an insult to Christopher Waltz acting carrier, and to the Bond movies villains too... (I can cry while thinking about it). Waltz has been under utilized. The person who can be the king of villains in acting has just been given like 12 minute part. Where the hell Sam Mendes's thinking coming from... certainly not from his head. And I think, we should start expecting the same level of production from Barbara, as there are no more original bond novels left. All they can do more is to worsen it only. Casino Royale was the last original true in bond spirit movie... Rest, Bond may RIP... P.S. My heart is broken for what Sam did to Waltz carrier in this movie...Steer clear of this turkey I have just watched the new Bond offering - please please will someone put this franchise out of its misery as it is well past its sell by date. Everyone knows that when you see a Bond film much is formulaic but in this case it is just plain old tired. The plot is pedestrian, the acting (such as it is) is dire and the directing - well Mendes needs to run a mile away from the next one and stick to what he's good at. Daniel Craig has done some good work in his career but I'm sure this has to be his worst and I trust he won't be doing the next one. The whole film is such a crushing bore I would rather watch paint dry than even think about watching it again. Please don't waste two and a half hours of your life and steer clear of this turkey."The dead are alive": Spectre is a gift for Bond fans and a great action thriller with a surprising amount of complex and contrived heart. This review will be mostly spoiler free because despite all the problems that the production and the writing suffered this movie is a self conscious sleight of hands between all the things you think you know about the plot mixed with dark and funny surprises that pave their way through around the final half. And that's an incredible triumph over all the odds that must be experienced in bare bones. It's a terrific Bond film (more Bondish than Skyfall in a gloriously preposterous way)that has the equals in production values, score (Thomas Newman mixing Skyfall cues with new ones fits well), direction, performances and the brave narrative decisions taken in its script. But let me say this in advice: it may not exactly reach the same smart and complex, deeper and meaningful way achieved in the very personal Skyfall. The priceless opening sequence: Masterful. Eye popping. Five minutes (or so) in one tracking shot. Never seen before in the franchise. Maybe the best prologue EVER. This is how you start a movie in a truly rip- roaring fashion. Opening credits: It's a special affair to take part. Sam Smith tune has a little to compare with the epic scoop from Adele, but as a slow burning ballad is terrific for the movie (and very gorgeously designed for it, culminating in a very special opening titles). Is about a man who is an assassin but at the same a time a human being with his flaws (more or less in a way like Dench's M wants for Bond at their first face to face in Casino Royale) and his uncertain demise to find someone pure and up to him¬Ö The rest of the movie (If I'd reveal anything, I would deserve a ban from all the users of this site): it takes a little of time at some parts and it probably would affect in direct comparison to its predecessor. But this movie is able to live up the plot of Skyfall by deeper extravaganza and funnier build up even if it tries to rehash elements rather than add other news (wait a while in order really meet the villain, spy games in MI6 office, Bond has to operate in the shadows again¬Ö). Taking its basis as a somewhat follow up (it starts as an extended epilogue indeed with a special message from someone of the past brought back from dead "for a few moments") it develops its own big story with style, patching the whole Craig's era so far and even paying homage to certain iconic moments of his run (there's a cracking torture scene this time too that may push the rating a bit too far) and the franchise overall (the fight in the train, a cat, iconic action sequence in the snow). Just when you think that the script is falling in a familiar territory, the film suddenly subverts your expectations using human drama (very effective for Bond and Oberhauser) instead the action or the fatigue. And the reveals make these characters even more likable and interesting. This smells like the truly 50th anniversary but 3 years later due to finding itself very encouraged to include references of the whole 007 story than the personal previous outing: It 's a thrilling and tragic Bond film, with best of Connery/Moore (and Lazenby) roots (gadgets included) but without becoming too campy or an absurd parody of itself. The performances (Fiennes, Whishaw, Harris, the twisted Andrew Scott, Monica Bellucci in her little amount of screen time "without mercy" and obviously the Bond "new" main interest: L√©a Seydoux) are top notch as we could expect from Sam Mendes (even better in the direction). But Christoph Waltz (as insanely brilliant as we were looking for even if falls short to be as resonant as Silva and being closer to a more billed Le Chiffre), Dave Bautista (perfect, brutal, ruthless and iconic) and Daniel Craig (he nails it: operatic complex, dark, emotional and riveting-best Bond EVER) are the three best things that could ever happen to the movie in performances terms. From its orgasmic start in Mexico City to his hard hitting conclusion in London, Spectre is a gift for newcomers and classics Bond fans and a great action thriller with a heart. I don't know if it's the best Craig's Bond movie (Casino Royale is still a modern classic and Skyfall maybe fell in a better context and expectations in comparison with this one), but is a perfect entertaining and that was the same exciting affair happened to the two ones mentioned. While its deep psychological punch may not being so surprising nor original this time and the effectively reliable political urgency that made Skyfall so unique is left a little underweight with the M vs. C plot, Sam Mendes and the whole team can breathe relaxed. They have wrapped up their story in a new whole level and in a spectacular victory fashion by succeeding presenting a riveting story in terms of pure emotion and action. And if this is the real farewell to Daniel Craig's run he couldn't really ask for any better final outing, as well to thank to the producers and writers to have gifted him the greatest Bond era of all. He really leaves the tux (and the broken soul inside it) on a beautiful high. I'm even afraid if he agrees to come back (with almost the same team or another) even being my favorite Bond¬Ö Because to surpass this is going to be a hell of a difficulty.A Return to Classic Fun Bond Finally we get to have some fun in the Daniel Craig era. Skyfall was good but underwhelming. This brings back the punches of classic Bond and has outstanding performances from Craig, Seydoux, and Waltz. Not to mention Harris (who is becoming crucial and wonderful in her character development), Fiennes, Winshaw, and Kinnear. Also Bellucci and Bautista serve their roles very well. Waltz was the funnest to watch and I always pegged him for this role of Bond villain since I first saw Inglorious Basterds and boy, he did not disappoint. He eats up his scenes and eschews the sadistic egomaniac with charm, style, and class. The scenery and shooting were breathtaking especially the shots in the Austrian Alps and the Train sequence was a great nod to the ghosts of Bonds past (From Russia with Love and The Spy Who Loved Me). Let's hope for many more.Craig's Best Bond Movie Just came out of the theater and I'm literally blowing away! As a moviegoer and movie lover looking for a good entertaining is simply irresistible not to like this movie even just a little. But if your genre is the action or you are a Bond fan-boy (but a real fan-boy, the one who knows that Bond is a dark killer with a great sense f humor as well a troubled human being and not just a fantasy and silly spy in silly missions with a handful of gadgets) then SPECTRE will be a total feast for you. Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig give us another triumph after the polemic "Skyfall" and this time both have managed to get a perfect balance between that intimate psychology from the previous outing and the nostalgia from a classic Bond movie (with quality, not just passable) that hadn't had hit the theater in a very while. By that way we found ourselves in a very Bond centric movie (perhaps the only one in the whole franchise in which Craig is the absolute protagonist without being overshadowed even by the handsome villain) that explores and expands the character beyond the limits from the last third of Skyfall and a truly genuine adventure full of suspense and crazy twists to maintain the attention. Across many places (Rome, Tangiers, Austria and coming back to London for a classic suspenseful climax) we found Bond getting started in a personal mission out from the MI6 (although later he will enlist some of his confidence partners with him) that drives him from a enigmatic widow (Monica Bellucci steals the scene alongside Craig) to a beautiful and looking innocent Madeleine Swann (L√©a Seydoux) until coming face to face to Franz Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz doing himself stills being fitted for the role and gives chills in his scenes with Craig). The story is bigger than Skyfall, Quantum and Casino Royale all together. And that's funny because this movie is really connected to all of them (another thing that makes me love Daniel Craig's Bond era). And marrying the credible word (political games, drones included) with the preposterous touch of any of the classic movies of Bond (Oberhauser, his hidden base, his plan) as well giving the Bond past a lot more of light and an effective closure by the end makes SPECTRE to succeed over any negative expectation and to give the audience the most entertaining outing coming from Craig and probably his best Bond yet (anyone knows if he's returning for another one even at another studio?). It's clearly a movie for those of you who are truly fans of Craig's unique run, but for all the haters too (because that lack of Bondish elements are there and most notably than ever). The humor is back (a drunken conversation with a rat makes the funniest and most hilarious moment) even at times that you couldn't imagine (the torture scene is intense, much better than the classic one in Casino Royale, but handed with dark laughs at some parts). The action is crazy and shot with class (the one shot that opens the movie is the most beautifully complex the franchise has given us so far) and the script goes along the way without going down at any moment or being lazy. It tries hard to touch a lot of plots into a big one to the final part of the film and that implies to focus on some parts more than others. But all the movie wants to be seen and experienced is explored and is a hell of a ride. SPECTRE is the most enjoyable Daniel Craig Bond film (and probably his farewell-with-a-bang), and the best Bond movie in recent memory. I did not exactly know what to expect for this installment after being put to sleep after the breathtaking Skyfall (so all the hype surrounding it) but not such a bold movie like this. If he (Craig) really leaves after this one, he will achieve something that Connery, Moore &amp; Brosnan failed to do: say goodbye to the character on a stunning high. My personal ranking of Daniel Craig as James Bond: SPECTRE (1¬∫) / Skyfall - Casino Royale (2¬∫, both deserve it) / Quantum of Solace (3¬∫).my name is boring, blandjames boring Seriously, i think i slept through half of this movie only to be waken up by the janitor 2 and half hours later after the movie ended, seriously, this movie is boring, first of, the opening is just, HERE'S AN OCTUPUS, AND ANOTHER ONE, AND ANOTHER ONE AND ANOTHER ONE, with some bland ass music to go with, also the james bond girl in this movie is awful, like , she isn't even a character, she is a sex toy that james bond plays with boring/boring- FOR GOD SAKES THIS MOVIE IS BORINGEasily The Worst Among Craig's Bonds This is easily the worst among Craig's Bond movies up till now. There is absolutely nothing to look forward to in this one. Craig could not sign off with a bang in his supposedly last Bond flick, maybe that's the reason he has declared to be back with yet another one with the studios, as he himself admitted he just does not go want to go off with a whimper. It had to do with a super-weak script and a very very ordinary Bond girl for company. I kept waiting for this new Bond girl, as this has always been something to look out for in Bond flicks and it is only halfway into the movie did I realise, oh, is this Lea Seydoux who will be giving Bond company for the whole movie, come on, 50+ Monica Bellucci would have been a far more attractive prospect there. The only saving grace was probably the villain Christopher Waltz. He is damn good as he always is, can never forget him in the opening scene of Inglorious Basterds. Action scenes were cliche and this movie expectedly got average reviews. 6/10.The best Craig Bond movie Anyone who rated this as less than a 7/8 is a moron. It's embarrassing at times to read the clever idiots opinion. This is very clearly and quite possibly Craig's best movie bar Layercake and one of the best Bond outings, fullstop. The beauty of the Bond movie is the homage it pays to all the previous films, the fight scene on the train point in case. Craig smoulders as usual, but this time it is play delicately and with the smoothness a 00 agent should portray. Yes it's another Bond escapade of the usual expectation, yet this time they got it well above par. Craigs previous attempts have been suspect, but not this time. Please ignore the below par reviews, because it easily deserves more than this, anyone who has a big pathetic chip on their shoulder and a keyboard at hand should know better, you are a poor show. Even the worst miserable git would give this an easy 6.. Good movie. End of.A sensory splendor and emotionally impactful story, let down by ambiguous scripting This might not be the best Daniel Craig Bond, but it is a great film none-the-less, a visual and auditory feast, which is let down by its script, which could have brought further clarity to what is an emotionally impactful story.  Firstly, the film is technically and artistically stunning showpiece. It continues the Bond globe-trotting experience. Each location is worthy of acclaim. From the opening Day-of-the-Dead sequence in Mexico City, to the closing credits, Spectre is striking. I'm not just talking about the static scenery either. The action is well-choreographed, suspenseful. and, given Bond's penchant for against-the-odds survival, the set-piece moments finely toe the line between 007 and over-the-top outrageous. Even in it's most frenetic, the action is visceral and not reliant on obvious cgi, so 'believability' ultimately wins out. Similarly, the music elicits a awesome and suspenseful chord. There is a constant undercurrent that builds the films tone of looming, pervasive background threat.  On that note, the villain of this film is a throwback to Bond of old but represents a greater universal fear, anxiety brought on by all-seeing-eye of the information age. MI6 too is under attack, by threat of irrelevance, by way of technological progress, and some key architects of this progress. Bond's character is shaped by this impending threat, and the villain looming in the background. HIs tragic existence as a 00 agent is brought into light here.  Bond wrestles with the demon of profound loss, his loved ones jeopardized by the life he chose to lead as an agent. As we come to learn, the film's villain is somewhat like a puppeteer, pulling the strings behind Bond's life and loss. At first glance, this does a disservice to Bond's story, alleviating his guilt by giving him a clear scapegoat for his pent up grief. But, as we come to learn, this connection is not arbitrary, but crucial to Bond's upbringing. As in Skyfall, we are given just a glimpse into Bond's past, of a time when he more human than agent. If throughout the film Bond appears traditionally disconnected, stoic, and dangerous, defined by his desire for cheap thrills of women, drink, and violence, at the expense of those he cares for, that guise in more transparent than ever, and in the cracks in his facade, we glimpse the humanity he wrestles with.  For despite his roguish actions, Bond's fondness for Money-Penny, Q, and M, as well as his reverence for country and honor, are on display as well. He brings the crew into his world by bestowing upon them trust. He allows them to help him, a rarity for a man who built his life and career upon distrust in the world and others. Though this display of trust, Bond reveals his true colors. These MI6 relationships are the backbone of the movie, heightened by excellent work from Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, and Ralph Fiennes.  Ultimately, despite all that I enjoy about this film. I can't help but feel the the script relies too heavily on cliche and ambiguity. I ask: Would it have better served this film to make the storytelling a bit more transparent to the viewer through richer dialogue and character motivations? Spectre's deeper themes may rely too heavily on visual language and extended metaphor to usurp the one dimensional traditional Bond tropes on display . On the other hand, this film is a sensory experience, and perhaps the ambiguity of the scripting and superficial gloss serves to reinforce the themes at play. As one must look beyond Bond's obvious actions to understand the man inside, the viewer must search beyond the film's veneer to uncover the emotional resonance.I am your best chance of staying alive This is a sequel to SKYFALL. Bond battles "the author of all his pain" as his secret past is revealed. An international organization plans on uniting all the top intelligence agencies in order to combat terrorism. However their goals are not benign nor are their methods honorable. Bond has his hands tied by his own agency as he operates in a semi-rogue fashion. The film gives us plenty of over the top action, Bond girls, Bond lines, Bond car and the Bond drink. I don't recall the casino. It shows the evolution of a man. It also shows us why men like Bond are obsolete in the modern world of intelligence gathering and drones....or does it? Perhaps it is me, but the film seems to changed to have more action than drama.worst colorgrading How boring it is i ll not repeat. Technically that movie is lack of quality. All movie is yellow color, JB face color changes every picture and again yellow face like everything . Movie quality is like from 80's . Who made this s.. colorgrading he should quit this job and find something else."SPECTRE is one of the better Bond films and certainly the most complete one of the Daniel Craig era" As far as movie franchises go, nothing and no one can touch James Bond. 50+ years and 24 films so far have ensured 007's status as the seemingly immortal superpower of British cinema. If we needed further evidence of this: 2012's SKYFALL became the highest grossing James Bond film ever. In addition, it currently sits in 13th place on the list of highest grossing movies of all time. In short, SPECTRE has a lot to live up to. But if anyone's up to the task, it's Bond, James Bond. The film starts very strongly; an opening sequence that must be regarded as one of the best in the Bond's history. A single tracking shot following Daniel Craig's 007 to his intended target, eventually culminating in a fight onboard a moving helicopter is absolutely thrilling. By the time we've faded into the fantastically realised opening credits, complete with Sam Smith's haunting vocals, the stage has been well and truly set for something quite special. From this point the film makes the most of its bladder-challenging 148 minute running time, taking Bond and company from London to Rome, Tangier and snowy Austria. Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography ensures each new location is presented as something resembling an excerpt from a well-produced tourism video. This really is Bond as we've grown to know him over the past 50+ years: he travels, he fights and he's always got time for a quick shag. Daniel Craig has taken his time settling into the role of Bond. CASINO ROYALE was largely devoid of the wisecracking one-liners and suaveness that the previous entries had in bucket loads. As the Craig-era films have progressed, there's been a gradual reintroduction of the familiar character traits, to the point where SPECTRE really feels like Bond is now his old self again, or should that be new self? Another part of the gradual reintroduction of the familiars also came with the first appearances of Moneypenny (Harris) and Q (Whishaw) as well as the man who would become M (Fiennes) in SKYFALL. With the band together at last, Bond has come full circle, and SPECTRE revels in its moments of the fun Bond has with his colleagues, particularly Q. Any good Bond film of course, needs its Bond villain. The casting of Christoph Waltz as the far too mysterious Franz Oberhauser seems like inspired casting. Waltz has a natural flair for the sinister and as previous Bond's have shown; it's not always the more physically astute villains that are the most dangerous. It is a shame therefore that Oberhauser never quite comes across as the villain he could have been. He falls into that easy to step into sandpit of being villainous for the sake of it, a self-explained back-story into the reasoning's behind his villainous ways feels a little underwritten. Providing the perfect contrast to Oberhausen's small stature is his chief henchman Mr. Hinx (Bautista). While his name may sound like something you might name your cat, it's clear from his introductory scene, in which he showcases a particularly nasty way of offing a potential rival, this is one of Bond's nastiest foes yet. A later fight sequence between Hinx and Bond on a train is also very hard-hitting, even for a Bond film. Try as they might, one thing the Bond writers haven't quite mastered yet is the 21st century Bond girl. Previous instances show that an effort has been made to make the new-era Bond girl strong and not always necessarily in need of a man to save them... only to eventually need saving from Bond by the time the climatic events are taking place. SPECTRE's main girl Madeliene Swann (Seydoux) falls nicely into this category. An area where SPECTRE really excels is in some of the smart script work. The MI6 building still stands with the damage inflicted during the events of SKYFALL; a visual metaphor for the state of the British secret service and its perceived perception. This is where Andrew Scott's Max Denbigh (or as Bond affectionately nicknames him: C) comes in. He's a member of the British government intent on bringing down the 00 program as he perceives it to be 'prehistoric'. He is insistent that a global communication of privacy-invading surveillance is necessary to combat the potential threats of this world. He's also a bit of a snarky git. His interactions with M provide some of the film's best bits of dialogue, and also provide this film with its biggest laugh-out-loud moment towards the film's climax SPECTRE feels very much like a culmination of what has come before in the Daniel Craig-era of Bond. There are many references to the previous films and even a big reveal of a major plot thread that ties all the films together. There are also a few nice knowing nods to previous Bonds (hello, pussy) just to keep the die-hards happy. There are a few familiar Bond fallings that do threaten to hamper the fun at times, but there is enough here to ensure that SPECTRE is one of the better Bond films and certainly the most complete one of the Daniel Craig era.The second weakest of the Craig Bonds Although 'Casino Royale' is often considered the best Daniel Craig Bond film, my personal favourite is actually 'Skyfall'. That said, 'Casino Royale', after liking it well enough, fared much better on re-watch. 'Quantum of Solace' however was a major disappointment, and for me deserves its distinction as one of the worst of the series. While the James Bond series has had its highs and lows, most of the films have been very enjoyable. At least three or four of Sean Connery's Bond films are among the best of the series (my personal favourite of the lot being 'Goldfinger'), with the only big misfire being 'Diamonds are Forever', despite one of the series' greatest theme songs. 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' is also very good'. Roger Moore's films are mostly entertaining enough, though for me the only great one was 'The Spy Who Loved Me', with 'A View to a Kill' and 'Octopussy' (an unpopular opinion though) being two of the series' weakest. Wasn't crazy about Timothy Dalton's two entries, 'The Living Daylights' is the better of the two but is only decent. Pierce Brosnan's are not very popular with some Bond fans, for this viewer they're not bad; loved 'Goldeneye' and 'The World is Not Enough', liked 'Tomorrow Never Dies' and while 'Die Another Day' has enormous problems (especially Madonna's theme song being in the top 5 worst Bond themes, some cringe-worthy puns, over-silliness in the second half and an overload of CGI that was also pretty awful), I don't consider it that irredeemably bad, because it started off strongly and most of the performances were good, especially from Brosnan, Dench, Youn, Cleese and Pike, the only real sore spot being Madonna's cameo. Starting with what is good about 'Spectre' it is mostly very stylishly made with great use of atmospheric and beautiful locations. Some of the action sequences are exciting, particularly the train sequence and the supercar chase through Rome. The Mexico City pre-credits sequence is also pretty epic. Sam Mendes' direction has its moments, with evidence of style, elegance and thrills. There are also some good performances. Daniel Craig is as charismatic and debonair as ever, handling the dramatic and action moments well, though there was a slight sense of him starting to get bored of the role (nowhere near as bad as Connery in 'Diamonds are Forever' though). Christoph Waltz is very good- if also rather underused- as the main villain, a role that suits him to the ground, playing him with smarmy, sinister relish. Ralph Fiennes is enjoyably starchy, David Bautista conveys some menace as assassin Hinx and Ben Whishaw brings genuine spark to Q. However, for me, and other viewers too, 'Spectre' does suffer from some major problems. It particularly suffers from a confused tone, with a mix of violent action, humour with in the in-jokes and spy clich√©s, thriller and romance. While there are moments like some fun to spot references, neither component come off consistently or even that successfully. A good deal of the action is overblown and cartoonish rather than exciting (only the Rome chase and train sequence are memorable), with some the violence gratuitous. The humour is misplaced and border on parody that would have been more at home in something like 'Austin Powers'. The thriller elements do lack suspense and tension, due to parts that feel too recycled which gave it a real over-familiarity. Lastly, the romance is not interesting or developed at all, and has no natural or obvious chemistry. L√©a Seydoux is a rather vapid Bond girl with very little to her, while Monica Bellucci is pretty much wasted in a too-brief appearance. Hinx is for personal tastes rather underwritten, but David Bautista does do what he can and as said conveys some menace. Andrew Scott's C is an obnoxious character and played every bit as obnoxiously. The film is far too long by half an hour, drags in the second half, ends ridiculously and anti-climactically and contains a muddled script with clumsy over-congratulatory in-jokes and hackneyed, dreary dialogue and feels very overblown in places. Mendes shows a gift for visual style and drama but forgets the suspense and tension unfortunately, while the editing (though not as bad as 'Quantum of Solace') is enough to make one confused and seasick. Thomas Newman's score is somewhat repetitive, and Sam Smith's theme song- like most- did absolutely nothing for me and one of the most undeserved Oscar wins in recent years, for me it is certainly the most undeserved in the category that there's been too and one of my least favourite Bond themes. It's ballad-like feel is at odds with the style of the rest of the film and feels like there are more than one climax that never happens when it's meant to. Smith's singing does not fit the song either, it's a song that sounds like it requires a more powerful voice and more emotional connection, the falsetto (a sound and technique that in all honesty I've never liked) was completely out of place as well and made Smith sound like a wimp. All in all, not as awful as it has been made out, and it is a better film than 'Quantum of Solace' but disappointing (especially with 'Skyfall' having been so good) and Craig's second weakest Bond. 5/10 Bethany CoxA Bond film in the classic mould Following on from the success of SKYFALL, the latest James Bond flick sees both Daniel Craig and Sam Mendes returning to the franchise for a film which seems strangely old-fashioned, perhaps deliberately harking back to the classic days of Bond. SPECTRE isn't a perfect film by any sense, and the problems lie with the script. Some of the scenes are lazy, like the way Bond readily escapes from entrapment or doesn't seem to suffer ill effects after undergoing some - shall we say intense - experiences. It's also overlong, at two and a half hours, and with judicious pruning it could have been snappier and pacier. At the same time, it's a resolutely entertaining picture, simple and yet one which has enough momentum in it to keep you watching throughout. Craig gives a subdued turn as the slick and professional British agent, allowing others to shine; Christoph Waltz is a delight, as ever, while Lea Seydoux is the best of the Bond girls since Eva Green starred in CASINO ROYALE. I'm always pleased to see Monica Bellucci up on the screen, whilst Dave Bautista's henchman is in the classic mould. SPECTRE has an enjoyable, globetrotting feel to it, and I particularly liked the way that supporting regulars like M, Q, and Tanner all had a greater part to play here. The way the story links up to previous films is cleverly achieved, and the action sequences, although familiar and done before, are well handled, with good effects work. SPECTRE also retains a surprisingly vicious edge despite the 12 certificate. As a fan who's seen all of the Bond movies out there, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed this one too.cool but not great James Bond (Daniel Craig) followed the previous M's instruction to kill Marco Sciarra. He only shows the message to Moneypenny (Naomie Harris). This leads to an embarrassing Mexico City incident for the new M (Ralph Fiennes) who suspends Bond. M is organizing a merger with MI-5 and C (Andrew Scott) is creating surveillance system "Nine Eyes" looking to shut down "00". Bond steals a car from Q (Ben Whishaw) to attend Sciarra's funeral where he meets his wife Lucia (Monica Bellucci). Using the stolen Sciarra ring, Bond infiltrates a Spectre meeting headed by Blofeld (Christoph Waltz). Dr. Madeline Swann (L√©a Seydoux) is the daughter of a murdered Spectre agent and key to bringing down the organization. With the return of Spectre, I was hoping for a great villain to take his place among the greats of Bond villains. Waltz barely gets up in his first scene and takes forever to return. He's a missed opportunity for a supervillain. Andrew Scott is the sleazy weasel but he's not that guy. This movie is exceedingly cool and filled with sharp action. It's missing something. It's missing greatness. It's missing the great memorable thing. The movie is sometimes a little slow with long expositions. The audience don't really need it. They already know who the bad guys are. They just need Bond to catch up and find them. This is a fine Bond movie but one that may be forgotten among the rest.Solid and enjoyable even if it could have used more character and spark to make it more than 'a Bond movie' With all the hype around this film, it was hard to come to it as just another Bond film and not the 'event' that the release of a new one has become. However, it is best to come to it as such, because essentially this is what it is ‚Äì another Bond film. Drawing a lot from the series already, and recreating very famous organizations and characters, the plot sees a continuation of the road of the previous films, with a message from beyond the grave sending Bond in pursuit of something he is not quite sure of. In doing so the film essentially delivers a lot of elements that we have come to expect from this recent run of films, and from Bonds generally. The pre-credits sequence is not quite as thrilling as it was billed, but is still a solidly enjoyable series of stunts run together (although I suspect the technical achievement of the helicopter sequence is probably more impressive than just watching it). From this point onwards the film runs a familiar course, which is not a bad thing, but too often the film seems to forget to thrill as it should. No doubt it is robustly constructed, and the quality and crafting is evident in almost every regard, but this is not always a good thing. Bond himself feels a little bit on the rails, and pulled along by the plot. Of course an element of this is that this is precisely what the plot of the film is, but at the same time I didn't get much 'person' from him compared to previous films, and his later connections with Swann didn't remedy that. Likewise too many other characters do what they say on the tin ‚Äì and it was only really Whishaw's Q that had some spark to him. Craig himself is strong as a presence, and this does bring out the feeling that he could easily have delivered more given the chance. Seydoux is a throw-back Bond girl, needing rescuing and not having a great deal of character. Waltz is a great villain because he is very good at this sort of character ‚Äì so watchable in the last few films he has done, here they give him space and dialogue to be an imposing presence, and he does it well. The rest of the cast are very much supporting and doing so in defined roles ‚Äì which is fine but seems a shame with so many big names. Spectre is still a solidly enjoyable film; it doesn't live up to the hype, or the pressure put on it by Skyfall, but it is still a solid Bond. It does all the things you expect it to do, albeit with a rather workmanlike feeling that will make you wish it had been delivered with just a bit more spark and energy to it at key moments.Bond vs. surveillance "Spectre" is the newest entry to the long-running and successful James Bond franchise. It is Daniel Craig's 4th turn as the world's most famous agent and the second time for Sam Mendes as director. The movie takes place basically right after the end of "Skyfall" and there are several references back to this 3rd Daniel Craig Bond film, but also to the two films before that, mostly about Vesper Lynd, but also about LeChiffre. Judi Dench has a brief scene as M again and we find out what happened to Mr. White. But now that I mentioned M, let's elaborate a bit on that. Ralph Fiennes is back in the role and he is a very different M than all the ones before him. He actually keeps firing and fighting, something you totally wouldn't expect if you knew these characters from the old movies sitting behind their desk from 8 to 5. Then again, Fiennes' M has some kind of military background if I remember "Skyfall" correctly. The female main role is played by French actress L√©a Seydoux and well. what can I say about her. I think she is a good actress and has stunning looks and I totally can see Bond falling for her. She looks breathtaking in this film, almost as good as in "La belle et la b√™te". The acting is above-par for Bond girls usually and she is doing a fine job with her character. Still, there are incongruences. She decides to leave Bond as she cannot live with another assassin, but quickly changes her mind, which destroys a strong farewell scene. And in the end, Bond chooses her and decides not to kill Blofeld and he says to Q that he is gone. Second time, Craig's Bond is deeply in love after Vesper Lynd and I wonder how they will elaborate on that story line. I hope she won't get killed early in the next Bond film, but I guess they somehow have to come up with a story to get her out of the picture for Bond to return to MI6. It will be quite a challenge to make this one credible and not too similar to Lynd's. If I hadn't known that Craig will return, this actually could have been a very nice ending to his turn as James Bond with Blofeld finally not being able to take Bond's most precious. I briefly mentioned Blofeld above and he is played by Christoph Waltz. I must say I like him as an actor, but by now, he feels very similar with his mannerisms in totally different characters he plays. His characters always have their very own brand of humour and it would actually be nice to see him as a completely serious character at some point. I found his Blofeld not as interesting as Mikkelsen's LeChiffre or Bardem's Silva, which is quite a pity as they tried so hard to make him more memorable with him being the head of Spectre of course and also with the whole brother story. Waltz' "cuckoo" was even a bit cringeworthy during their talk. The scene with bond tied up in the chair and Blofeld acting like some psychopath scientist was really creepy, almost a touch of "Marathon Man". And of course of Connery's Goldfinger almost losing his balls to Auric's laser in this classic movie back then. Lets talk a bit about the henchmen: Wrestling legend Dave Bautista plays a character who does not really add something great to the story and does not even make sense. He comes into the room, kills apparently a high-profile aide of Blofeld and is still appreciated. I guess this was intended to show what a cold-blooded killer he is. But wasn't he intended to perform the stadium attack in Mexico City. This was completely forgotten for the rest of the film. Still, he was fun and his final fight with Bond (and Swann) and this one was a nice addition to the long history of memorable train fight sequences in Bond films. Generally, he had nice presence. Calling him a modern Jaws would be too much honor, but he was fine overall and they did great in letting him be quiet. That emphasized his cold-blooded ruthless character. "Sherlock" fans will appreciate the presence of Andrew Scott here. However, I must say that I did not find him too memorable. There is no denying he is a talented actor, but everything he did here he already did on "Sherlock" and not worse. Monica Bellucci was okay in her scene and shows us that Bond also has a weakness for older women. Ben Whishaw I remember not liking too much in previous films, but he was fine here as well. I am not yet too sure about the theme song this time, but it's probably not among my favorites. All in all, this was a good movie and I highly recommend going to a theater to see it on a big screen, not on a small computer screen. Then again , I am probably biased because of how big a fan of the franchise I am. I think it's worse than "Casino Royale" and "Skyfall", but better than "Quantum of Solace". One reason may be that the two I liked more have legendary locations, the ones in the title and this one and "Quantum of Solace" do not. As a whole, this was not a great Bond film unfortunately, but a pretty good one with some nice inclusions and references to older films (Blofeld's scar). I certainly recommend the watch, but I still hope that the next Bond film (with or without Mendes) will be truly great again.Entertaining and Amusing When the viewer watches any 007 franchise, he or she knows what is going to see: an entertaining full of action adventure, with beautiful women, car chase, conspiracy, great villains, predictable story and a brainless screenplay. "Spectre" is no exception and provides an additional amusing situation, with the weirdo Daniel Craig seducing the gorgeous L√©a Seydoux and Monica Bellucci without any chemistry. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "007 Contra Spectre" ("007 against Spectre")Quality craftsmanship; Kevin McClory's credit missing I salute the craftsmanship of "Spectre", certainly a quality production ($245,000,000 buys a lot of value on screen, not counting product placement $) and have enjoyed it - I've been going to Bond movies since catching "Dr. No" back in my hometown of Cleveland in 1963. I was surprised to see no Kevin McClory credit, but perhaps I should know better. Not really a case of vendetta or getting even -you can read briefly about the S.P.E.C.T.R.E and Blofeld litigation in the notes for the film on IMDb. I interviewed McClory 30 years ago in my capacity as a Variety newspaper reporter in NY, as he was fighting Eon regarding the rights to such material. He had worked with Ian Fleming on screenplays and claimed creation rights to some Bond material (he ultimately produced 2 Bond films). So no credit at all, after the rights were finally cleared 30 years later? Seems vindictive to me, but like all legalisms, there may have been a good reason, akin to those good old "gag orders" we read about all the time, or nondisclosure agreements when cases are finally settled. Under the supervision of the heirs to the Broccoli fortune and franchise, director Sam Mendes has done a commendable job though where being a traffic cop ends and creativity begins is unknown on a project of this scale. It's easier to blame the director for a fiasco (similarly budgeted and to me even more highly anticipated "The Golden Compass" from the great Philip Pullman's novels, also starring Daniel Craig, for example). But the clockwork precision of "Spectre" is worth examining. Mendes works with a classic tension &amp; release formula, well-adapted to the Bond genre. The sadism that Ian Fleming popularized in pop culture (building on the perhaps unfortunate inroads made earlier by Mickey Spillane with his Mike Hammer novels) remains, particularly in the stock Blofeld scene of a committee of bad guys sitting around an out-sized conference table, so that film's lead goon can gorily kill one by gouging his eyes out. Bond himself is tough and rugged in Craig's interpretation, without meting out as much unmotivated violence as his licence permits. The travelogue nature of the franchise, established early on with exotic globe-hopping settings, is maintained here, even throwing the viewer a bone every once in a while with a panoramic shot worthy of "Lawrence of Arabia". Problem of course, is that unlike a David Lean film the material is paper-thin, not adding up to much thematically despite the attempts of the screenwriters to inject elements (villain Waltz and hero Craig as sort of step-brothers) into the mix. But the meticulous nature of the build-up to each segment's derring-do payoff is admirable, and shows a Hitchcockian expertise at using the film medium to manipulate the audience. I prefer more subtlety, but I certainly recall my youth when being manipulated by the thousands of movies I sat through was pleasurable in an escapist way. Again as an adolescent I was drawn to the sexiness of the Bond pictures, Ursula Andress being such a wonderful starting point, but it seems that is a Fleming element that has been squeezed out of the current formula, likely to maximize returns. Sad fact is that in a world drowning in pornography, no one need turn to James Bond for skin (other than the obligatory suggestiveness of the opening credits' sequence, here very well done by Dan Kleinman), so where a shooting script might have listed "Insert sex scene here" we merely get an ellipsis when Bond is ready to get down with all- time great sex symbol Monica Bellucci, or even the leading lady Lea Seydoux. As a fan of storyline pornography I'm well aware of the difficulty of maintaining any sort of pacing AND including a lengthy sex scene in a movie, but Mendes's solution of eliminating the sex scenes altogether is quite disappointing. He does gift us with a few seconds of Judi Dench's "M" character from beyond the grave. One last footnote - though Bond is quintessentially British it is worth reminding folks that technically the productions are American, since (I refer you to Alexander Walker's excellent industry book "Hollywood, England" for details) all the British studios and production houses turned down the original Bond projects, with the honchos at United Artists funding and giving the green light, making "Dr. No", with UA and its successor companies like MGM (though now Sony through Columbia is distributing the pictures), produced by Broccoli and Saltzman from a UK base. The backing was always from Hollywood.Waltz Makes It Worthwhile A cryptic message from Bond (Daniel Craig)'s past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organization. While M (Ralph Fiennes) battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind SPECTRE. Each Bond film really needs to be viewed on its own merits, because trying to determine the continuity is confusing. This time within the series' continuity, the version of Spectre that appeared in "Diamonds Are Forever" was written out of the timeline with the 2006 reboot of the franchise in "Casino Royale", making its appearance in "Spectre" its first in the new timeline. So just pretend you never heard of Blofeld or Spectre, although you probably have. The continuity is also strange with the change of casting on M and Q, but it is a good change. The younger, fresher Q is a good attempt to move the series into the 21st century. The idea of blood that can be tracked makes sense, but probably would have sounded ludicrous in earlier entries. The action scenes are also much better filmed than "Quantum of Solace", making this a strong follow-up. What does the future hold for James Bond? As of now (September 2017), there is no firm date or title as far as I know. Seems like it might be time to bring him back...Spectre Skyfall became the highest grossing film in the UK, beating the record of Avatar, so there was great anticipation for the next in the film series for the famous spy created by Ian Fleming, from returning Skyfall director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition). The name SPECTRE will be familiar to those who know the books and the film series, it was originally an acronym (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), it is now just simply the name of the organisation, but elements seen previously remain. Basically the previous M (Dame Judi Dench, in a short cameo) unofficially ordered James Bond 007 (Daniel Craig) on a mission to Mexico, there he kills two men planning to blow up a stadium, criminal Marco Sciarra (Alessandro Cremona) survives after the building he is in collapses, Bond chases him and they fight in a mid flight and out-of-control helicopter, before throwing Sciarra and the pilot out Bond stole Sciarra's octopus ring. Returning to London, the new M (Ralph Fiennes) takes Bond off field duty indefinitely, M is currently in the midst of a power struggle against the head of the recently merged MI5 and MI6 Joint Intelligence Service, Max Denbigh, codenamed "C" (Sherlock's Andrew Scott), who wants to close down the double-0 section. Bond goes against orders, travelling to Rome to attend the funeral of Sciarra, he visits his widow Lucia (Irreversible's Monica Bellucci), he seduces her and she tells him about a criminal organisation her husband was a part of and where they are meeting that evening. The head of the table (Christoph Waltz) mentions the events in Mexico, also mentioning Bond by name, turning to face him when doing so, Bond escapes and is pursued in car chase, him in his new gadget filled Aston Martin DB10 and organisation assassin Mr. Hinx (Dave Bautista) through Rome. Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) informs him of a lead heard in Mexico and the meeting leads to former Quantum member Mr. White (Jesper Christensen), revealed to be a subsidiary of the organisation, Moneypenny also checks for Bond the name Franz Oberhauser. Bond finds White in the snowy mountains of Austria, he is dying of thallium poisoning, White tells Bond to find his daughter, Madeleine Swann (Blue Is the Warmest Colour's L√©a Seydoux) who will take him to L'Americain, which will lead to the organisation, White then commits suicide. Bond finds Swann before she is snatched by Hinx, he chases the kidnappers in a plane and causes the three cars to crash, Bond and Swann escape, Hinx survives the crash. Bond and Swann meet with Q (Ben Whishaw) who reveals Sciarra's ring contains digital files linking to Oberhauser, the leader of the organisation, and previous enemies such as Le Chiffe and Raoul Silva, Swann informs them that the name of the organisation is Spectre, and that L'Americain is a hotel in Morocco. At the hotel the couple stay in the room Swann's father used to stay in every year, Bond discovers a secret room built by White, full of videotapes, charts and photographs, as well as coordinates for where to go next. On the train going to the nearest point they are attacked by Hinx, Bond manages to throw him off the train, at their destination they are picked up and taken to a secluded facility in the desert, where they are met by Oberhauser, who reveals himself as the son of the man who looked after the younger Bond when he was orphaned. While torturing Bond, and a white Persian cat seen roaming about, Oberhauser reveals that C is part of Spectre, he is feeding all intelligence data straight to the organisation, Oberhauser also reveals that he faked his death twenty years ago and goes by a new name, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, but Bond manages to escape, causes an explosion that injures his enemy, and destroys the facility. Back in London, Bond and Swann meet M, Bill Tanner (Rory Kinnear), Q and Moneypenny, they plan to stop C and the launch of Nine Eyes, the intelligence co-operation agreement between nine countries, in fact a takeover by Spectre, Bond gets kidnapped in the process, but Nine Eyes is stopped before launch, and in a struggle with M, C falls to his death. Bond is taken to the former MI6 building, derelict since the attack by Silva, he disables his captors, and meets Blofeld, now with a large scar across his right eye and face, he tells that the building is rigged to explode and he has three minutes to save Swann, hidden in the building. Bond finds her within the time and they escape in a boat onto the Thames, Blofeld gets away in a helicopter, but Bond fires on it and causes it to crash on Westminster Bridge, Bond aims his gun at Blofeld, but decides to let M arrest him, and Bond leaves with Swann in his repaired Aston Martin DB5. Also starring Stephanie Sigman as Estrella and Alessandro Bressanello as Priest. Craig remains cool and determined, Seydoux is a good choice as the Bond girl with guts, Bellucci (the oldest Bond woman) gets only minutes on screen, Waltz relishes smirking as the villain everyone expected to appear (because of the title), and the supporting cast of Fiennes, Scott, Harris and Whishaw are well placed too. I did question the critics giving the film three stars (instead my assumed four) out of five, but perhaps when I properly examine it, it does have small clich√©s, but no matter, the story flows well and is easy to follow, the locations look great, and the action and chase sequences as always are high- octane and exciting, an entertaining spy adventure. It won the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Original Song for "Writing's on the Wall" by Sam Smith, the first Bond song to reach number one in the UK charts. Very good!the James Bond franchise should have ended decades ago Back when Sean Connery played James Bond, the movies were all about him being a suave dude who bedded a bunch of hot babes. He left the role because the movies were getting too tacky. By the time that Pierce Brosnan rolled around, the movies were nonstop gimmicks. When 2006's "Casino Royale" got released, a bunch of reviews called it the best Bond movie in years and said that it had brought the franchise back to its roots. I eventually saw the movie. Sure enough, just more gimmicks. The 1967 "Casino Royale" is the good one. And so, "Spectre" is still more gimmicks, and mark my words: Daniel Craig is NO Sean Connery. I'll admit that L√©a Seydoux is a real babe, but that doesn't cut it. I have no plans to ever see "Quantum of Solace" or "Skyfall". I don't care how many people praise them. This franchise wore out its welcome mat decades ago. Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Revolutionary Road) should be ashamed of himself. Avoid it!at times Spectre is a lot of fun. other times its just... over-elaborate, even for 007 The opening sequence of Spectre will surely be a reason many people will want to get a copy of the movie after its theatrical run once it's on DVD and online, or even to just tune in if people know it'll be on TV. In one of those super-long (maybe too long?) tracking shots, Bond, in a skeleton mask during the Day of the Dead festival in Mexico City, goes into a building (with a girl by his side at first), then as it looks like there's about to be some lust he breaks off to get to his actual target: some sinister figures in a building next-door. Then it goes into one of those BIG action set pieces, mostly involving a helicopter that Bond has a BIG fight in, and has to do BIG maneuvers to make sure that he doesn't take out civilians. It's one of those sequences that the public goes to 007 movies for, and I'm sure Mendes knows this. One is almost tempted to say he, so to speak, blows his wad there, but this isn't to say Spectre, the 24th Bond film, is poor by any means. Just... flawed, to say the least. This is the movie that actually, without spoiling too much, ties together the Daniel Craig Bonds that we've had so far, with the villains and the love interest in Casino Royale, Vespar Lynd, in the mix. There's really two plots which eventually converge: 007 tracking down through Rome and Austria (and eventually Tangiers) what significance a ring with an octopus insignia has and who is connected to it - semi (not really) spoiler, it means everything - and then as the new M (Ralph Fiennes) has to contend with MI6 being folded into MI5, and a new surveillance program taking shape. Oh, and MI6 may not really be what it is any more, and a whole new government program to be the "new" spy organization takes shape. If this latter part sounds at all familiar, it should be if you've been to the movies just this year; I could've sworn I saw this very similar storyline for Mission Impossible Rogue Nation, which also dealt with the "new" taking over the "old" and the spies we know and love having to go rogue. That doesn't happen right away in Spectre, but it's certainly in the air. The other thing that will seem familiar is... well, a lot of things, mostly if you're a Bond fan by any stretch (casual watchers may miss things, not unlike people who went to, I dunno, Star Trek Into Darkness and only, maybe, knew about Khan). The real "sectret" part has to do with a Figure in the Shadows (that old, treasured clich√©) who is played by Christoph Waltz. What does he have to do with 007? Do they know each other? All in good time, if you see the movies, you'll find out. But, again, it won't be any big surprise if you've seen other movies, like Thunderball as the primary example. Once again Mendes has visual flair and capable, stylish filmmaking (and a new DP in Hoyte who is really remarkable, barely a shade less than Deakins for Skyfall), and Craig is game to play this character the best he can. But for all of the build up of the first two acts, it felt like the third let itself down, or let me down or both. It's not that it doesn't build to something elaborate - on the contrary, it's something SO elaborate it's over-elaborate, in both how this entire Spectre organization functions and the actions that Waltz's character takes from one scene to the next as he finally takes charge as a villain. The trouble is too, as much build up as he gets and as much as Waltz soaks up playing this guy, there's not enough of him. Or, maybe there is enough, but what he does is things that we've seen Bond villains do before - or, to the point that we've seen certain elements that have been *parodied* in other films. All that's missing are fish with laser beams attached to their heads. This isn't all to say the movie is bad in any way. Spectre will deliver for fans of the franchise and just those people wanting some escape with the Martini-gun-toting-super-sex-being that is this hero. The filmmakers clearly love this world, in making characters like M and Q matter more than they might've in the past which is all well and good (Fiennes and Whishaw do well when they can), Monica Bellucci shows up and is great to see as the oldest (but, sadly, briefest) of Bond women, and the ending feels almost like the entire end to the franchise itself (not that it would be, it'd be like saying that there are no other organizations to monitor surveillance in the world oh nevermind). I may even watch it again on TV some time, but as it is plot gaps and/or set-piece over-compensation got the better of this movie.All the thrills one hopes for in a Bond Film As this, the forth of the Daniel Craig era Bond films opens we find Bond in Mexico City on the Day of the Dead. The camera tracks a man in a skeleton costume as he, and the woman he is with, walk through the crowd and into a hotel; the man removes his mask to reveal that he is in fact Bond. He excuses himself and goes for a rooftop walk. He then watches two men talking in the building opposite before opening fire¬Ö moments later the building explodes! The target, Marco Sciarra, escapes with Bond in pursuit; he catches up with him just as he scrambles aboard a helicopter and a fight to the death ensues over the crowded Zocolo Square. After the credits Bond is back in London where M reprimands him for his unofficial operation in Mexico before telling him that their department is to be amalgamated into MI5 under the leadership of a man Bond insists on calling 'C'. C believes that the OO section is obsolete; the future of intelligence will involve intercepting communications and drones¬Ö to this end he intends to create 'Nine Eyes' a group of nine nations that will share all such data. Bond is told to stay in London but inevitable doesn't. We learn that the previous M had sent a posthumous message to Bond telling him to kill Sciarra then go to his funeral. Here, in Rome, he meets the dead man's wife and learns that he was part of a secret criminal organisation. Over the course of his investigation he learns that this organisation is known as SPECTRE and it has somehow been behind the events in the previous three films. He also learns that more than one person he assumed was dead is in fact alive; including the head of SPECTRE Franz Oberhauser; somebody he knew as a child but now calls himself Ernst Stavro Blofeld! As with all Bond films there is a Bond Girl and this one is Madeleine Swann, the daughter of SPECTRE member Mr. White who is being targeted for assassination by the group. At two and a half hours in length this is one of the longer Bond films but at no time did I find myself wondering how much longer it would be going on. The viewer is immediately gripped in the opening scene, which appears to be one long tracking shot. We then get an explosion, chase and finally a fight in a helicopter¬Ö all before the opening credits! From then on we get a number of great set-pieces including car chases, Bond rescuing Madeleine from would-be abductors as he chases their cars in a plane and numerous fights and shootouts. While the action is great there is also a solid story that nicely links back to the previous three films and (re) introduces the most famous of Bond villains in a way that gives him some back story. The cast does a fine job; Daniel Craig is on top form as Bond, a role he has made his own; while we instinctively know he will prevail there are moments where he makes us believe his character is in real and imminent danger. Christoph Waltz is suitable villainous as Blofeld, Andrew Scott is delightfully unpleasant as C and L√©a Seydoux makes a fine Bond Girl as Madeleine Swann. Talking of Bond Girls it was nice to see Monica Bellucci as Sciarra's widow¬Ö showing that you don't have to be young to be sexy. Dave Bautista was also rather fun as the thuggish assassin Mr. Hinx; his stature and lack of time for small talk reminded me of the character Jaws from the Roger Moore era but without the campness¬Ö he even got a brilliant send-off that was clearly a nod to the film 'Jaws'! Amid the action there are some scenes that may disturb some viewers; including an eye-gouging and Bond being tortured. This is balanced by plenty of humour though; most notably Bond's car that doesn't have all the weaponry loaded as he expected. There has been talk of this being Craig's last Bond film, while I hope that is not the case, the conclusion would make a fitting conclusion to his time as Bond. Overall a really fine entry to the Bond series; up there with the best.too long at the fair, 007 Time to retire this franchise. Big budget boredom - 007 is like Ol' Man River - he just keeps rolling along, but in the case of 007, this franchise has had it. My advice: After the first truly electrifying 13 minutes, turn this off and keep your happy memories.  In this one, Bond goes rogue after receiving a message from the beyond, in a way. He infiltrates a secret meeting and learns about the evil group SPECTRE. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, there's a new M (Ralph Fiennes) and a merger with MI5 and a decision to kill the Double O program. Might be a good idea, in fact. Madeleine Swan (Lea Seydoux), the daughter of an old enemy, may have the clue to finishing off SPECTRE.  A good cast includes, besides Craig, Fiennes, and Seydoux, Christopher Waltz as the head of SPECTRE and Sherlock's Moriarity on PBS, Andrew Scott, one of the best of the new crop of British actors. But all that doesn't help the script. That great budget and no one can write an exciting story. Car chases, sex with women Bond met 2 minutes ago, cartoon villains, torture - it's all there in small enough doses to make the 2-1/2 hours go by like the original Birth of a Nation.  I've seen Craig on stage twice - he's wasted here. About as exciting as flipping channels with a remote.Craig's list ... ... is coming to an end. Obviously every so often a new Bond will emerge and I think Daniel Craig is almost done with his Bond cycle. I think there is another planned, but after the really good Skyfall, this falls a bit behind in many terms. Than again, it was almost impossible to capture that lightning again. Too many things happened in the previous one, many linked and appreciating the past Bonds. As you can see from my rating, I still dig the movie, it's just that it has it's flaws. It kind of ticks all the right boxes (great opening sequence), good villain, some really good action set pieces and a tension that holds up until the end. Some still have an issue with Craig portraying Bond, but then again, when Idris Elba was suggested, many disagreed with that too (I think he'd be a great Bond, but that's a whole different story). Depending on your taste, you'll either like this or notSpectre is perhaps the best of the Daniel Craig James Bond movies yet! Besides this being the fourth consecutive Daniel Craig James Bond film, it's also the fourth me and my movie theatre-working friend had seen together. While he doesn't consider himself as much of a Bond fan as yours truly, he did really enjoy this one as did I. It had many familiar moments I remember from the previous entries yet there was also plenty that was new like the expanded roles of this current series' versions of both Q and Moneypenny in their helping of Mr. Bond on his mission. It also marked the return of the organization of SPECTRE and the main head of that, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, played here by Christoph Waltz though he's not initially ID'd as such. There are two Bond women here, Monica Bellucci and Lea Seydoux, that provide just enough heat to make one like them immediately and also care for them when their backgrounds are revealed. And Craig seems more comfortable in the role than ever now! Great action scenes abound, as always! So on that note, both of us highly recommend Spectre.It's time to shake up the franchise and add some FUN! 007 is back, hunting for the head of sinister criminal organisation SPECTRE, which plans to use an international intelligence network to further its nefarious activities. Spectre opens in fine form with a thrilling pre-credits action sequence that sees James Bond (Daniel Craig) narrowly escaping death when a building collapses around his ears before leaping on board a helicopter to do battle with a baddie above the crowded streets of Mexico City; then Sam Smith begins his godawful caterwauling, and the film never recovers. This latest instalment in the long running British spy series is another overly sombre adventure that once again lacks the excitement and thrills that I remember from the Bond films of my childhood. People love to scoff at the Roger Moore movies, but at least they were hugely enjoyable slabs of blockbuster entertainment, full of exotic locations and colourful characters; in contrast, Sam Mendes' movies are drab and largely boring. I don't blame Craig‚Äîhe actually makes for a great Bond‚Äîit's the overall tone, overly elaborate plots, and the film-makers' absolute refusal to have any fun that are to blame.What else there is there to do. 007? Sam Mendes returns to direct SPECTRE, and if SKYFALL was not enough...the thrill meter will sway back and forth with this one. Blue-eyed Daniel Craig returns to prove doubters that he is a genuine 007. Being dismissed by his superiors, a rouge Bond will only prove to excel as he swaggers and saunters with that half-smile in this his supposedly swansong in his James Bond tenure. Slick editing,gorgeous visuals,some haunting moods and maybe a bit too much nostalgia. Enthralling action scenes with 007 annihilating villains, no matter the gender. And probably one of the most grandiose and absorbing opening sequences taking place in Mexico during the Day of The Dead celebration. A crippled chopper and a crumbling building top chase only primes the pump for the viewer's captivation. The not so secret agent bounces from one eye-popping locale to the next to make shift work of his assignment. Christoph Waltz as Blofeld and Dave Bautista playing Hinx are formidable old-school villains. The British Aston Martin driving stud, Bond, will rely on assistance from M (Ralph Fiennes), Q (Ben Whipshaw), Moneypenny (Naomi Harris) and Lea Seydoux as the winsome widow, Madeleine. Also featured are: Monica Bellucci, Andrew Scott, Jesper Christensen, Alessandro Cremona and Rory Kinnear. Is there any doubt of the James Bond 007 franchise continuing?Irritating Mix Of Old And New . Possibly The Weakest Craig Bond Film I'm not much of a Bond fan but the great thing about Craig era Bond is that they're Bond films for people who don't like Bond films . None of this killing a bad guy then turning to camera making a wisecrack . None of this climatic fight sequence on a mode of transport with laughable back projection . With Craig's Bond if he says he's in Mexico the production team make sure the audience know he's in Mexico and not in a Shepperton film studio . If Bond gets hit in the genitals he'd feel it the same as 3.5 billion men . If a woman who he cares about gets killed he gets angst ridden about it . In other words we - the audience - can relate to this . It'd be a step too far to say Craig's Bond is now part of realist cinema but I for one feel this direction has saved a tired and dying franchise . With SPECTRE the series has taken a rather clumsy step backward  !!!! SPOILERS !!!!  It's not all bad . Sam Mendes keeps up the riveting work seen with the brilliant SKYFALL . The film opens with a continues shot where the camera gives the impression it's all done in one take . A female character leaves her house to stand beside a pool where two assassins follow her and again it's a great example of a tracking shot and you do get the impression the technical staff are after those Oscars next year . The film also contains gritty violence such as a Spectre agent being executed in a graphic manner . If you loved the art-house and deadpan tone of the previous three films then it's still sustained . Such a pity it's never sustained enough and we have to endure a few bits of nonsense we'd thought we'd never see again By this I mean we're back to the gadgets era of Connery , Moore and Brosnan . A car with an ejector seat and flame throwers ! Oh dear . Didn't like this much back in the day and don't like it now . In many ways it's even worse now because it jars with the serious tone of much of the film . Another annoying aspect is that Bond is able to endure much physical violence such as a fight on a train and brain drilling and yet seems to physically recover instantly . A million miles away from the Bond seen in CASINO ROYALE  This film's major failing is however contained in the title -SPECTRE . You've seen the trailers with Christoph Waltz telling Bond that he's been the cause of his pain etc but none of the motivation or continuity is ever satisfactorily explained . Spectre ties in with Quantum but why ? and how ? It does give a hint as to its philosophy when a character mentions "weakness" and decries "Democracy" which might indicate the organisation is a literally fascist cult but again this goes totally unexplored There's no reason for this organisation to be called Spectre except to reference earlier Bond films and use nostalgia as a marketing tool . It also has a plot twist of sorts where Waltz character reveals his true identity but again this seems like cynical fan servicing . He never seems like the character he is supposed to and is more in line with Elliot Carver from TNL  I found myself slightly disappointed by this film .SKY FALL had a lot to live up to and had been looking forward to this ever since the trailers came out . To be fair I didn't find myself pining for the Moore and Brosnan movies but SPECTRE feels like a retrograde step where gadgets and set pieces take precedence over plotting and character motivation . If SPECTRE breaks box office records it will be because of the previous Craig films and not because of its own meritsSpectre James Bond (Daniel Craig) has finally made his way to the terrorist organization called Spectre, a uniform group with its members from all over the world, led by Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) who has a personal connection to the 007 agent. After an unsanctioned trip to Mexico City to stop a member of Spectre from using a bomb that would have been set off in a stadium full of people, which is accidentally exploded in a building containing terrorists, James Bond must answer for doing so without authorization from M (Ralph Fiennes), suspended from duty. However, Bond isn't mindful of such a penalty as time off, and instead follows orders from his former boss (Judi Dench) who had sent him a recording prior to her death...this is what initiated Bond's mission to Mexico City, which was only a start to what lied ahead. MoneyPenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) reluctantly align themselves with Bond although their division in the British MI6 is rumored (and eventually are notified) to be shut down by a dangerous idealist, "C" (Max Denbigh, played by Andrew Scott), on the verge of forming an alliance with global powers in an effort to set up a spy network supposedly to "protect us all across the world". Max's agenda, however, could very well be sinister if implanted. Meanwhile, Blofeld has special plans for Bond who is trying to locate and eventually protect the daughter of a former member of Spectre, named Madeleine Snow (L√©a Seydoux). Bond wants to find Blofeld and Blofeld has envisioned the opportunity to meet him, and "Spectre" brings them together. As you might expect, eventually their meeting would be rather explosive. The Mexico City sequence opens "Spectre" with an absolute bang, as a building crumbles and collapses which winds up being eerily reminiscent to 9-11, and seeing Bond nearly perishing as his own building is took out by the domino effect is directed so magnificently, I can just hear the oooos and aahhs. Director Mendes' camera follows Bond in what seemed like an extended uninterrupted shot during the Day of the Dead in Mexico City as the locals are all in costume, and 007 walks into a hotel with an attractive woman on his shoulder, in a room that had a window that leads to a ledge he walks directly to a spot which is a direct bead to a room containing the Spectre member he is targeting for termination. This whole opening set piece ends with Bond and his quarry moving through a crowd in the city during the celebration until both are fighting in a chopper over the crowd! The battle between Craig and former pro-wrestler Batista in a train (after the latter leads a car chase after Bond during a high speed affair in Rome which itself is a thrill ride) with Seydoux getting involved, and the headquarters of Blofeld going up in flames thanks to a watch that packs a punch (Q provided to Bond prior to fleeing to Rome despite orders from M to stay in London), as it appears Bond's gig is up (he's bolted to a chair as Blofeld plans to use small drills to torture Bond through commands into a computer), are highlights. Also featured is Bond chasing after Batista and some of Blofeld's henchmen who kidnap Seydoux from her clinic in Austria by way of a plane (they in SUVs) and Bond needing to rescue Snow from the set-to-be-demolished MI6 building in London before it detonates (thanks to Blofeld who suffers a nasty scar on the side of his face, ruining his eye). Waltz, no surprise, knocks it out of the park as Blofeld, the ultimate nemesis of Bond, sociopathic and stone cold when it comes to doing whatever is necessary against 007 and to gain global power. The way Blofeld reminds Bond of how he has killed all those he loves over and over truly emphasizes his cold blooded nature. Waltz is a good casting choice for the villain, confident and smooth, but his Blofeld's obsession with bond ultimately is his downfall. Batista has the right brutish body type perfect for a bruising heel used to give Bond a hard time¬Önot needing to talk, he has this intimidating presence that is important to the role he is cast. Fiennes getting to play hero at the end when facing off with Scott is a treat, as well. Scott is one of those who manipulated his way into a prominent position, using that power as an intentional nuisance to M and his team.The Sceptre And The Rows ... ... and rows of Multiplex seats filled with the popcorn brigade watching this worldwide, How bad is it? Let me count the ways; first off it takes six writers to come up with The Spy Who Went Into The Cold or, to put it another way, to rip off John Le Carre inasmuch as this could just as easily have featured Daniel Craig as Alec Leams, seemingly on the outs with his Masters but in reality under cover on a secret 'mission' and working with the clandestine blessing of 'M'. As if that weren't enough they have no respect for the audience; example 1: Bond and Dr. Swan are in the middle of East Jesus in just the clothes they stand up in, next moment they'b both managed to change and only a little later in what is essentially the same sequence Bond appears in a tuxedo and Swan in an evening dress and a little later STILL, they have acquired luggage. example 2: Swan is kidnapped from under Bond's nose in the middle of a city; the kidnappers make off in three cars and within minutes are being pursued by Bond NOW PILOTING A PLANE. Where did it come from? Where did it take off from in such an urban setting. No doubt the popcorn brigade won't allow reality to spoil their enjoyment.Just follow the movie logic This film tells the story of James Bond trying to stop an underground terrorist organisation from taking over the world's secret intelligence service. "Spectre" opens with an intense scene in Mexico City, where buildings get blown apart and dangerous fights happen in a helicopter. After that, the story is a bit slow but still engages my interest. I recall that "Casino Royale" was so quick paced, scenes were so short that it was like an attention deficit fest. In "Spectre", the director takes time to tell and build the story. However, the story is not so strong, as the villain is a diffuse organisation that is so mysterious, that viewers are often left in the dark. There is a funny and memorable scene that shows James Bond taking a watch from Q, and this scene is used in the watch commercial before the film, which is a nice touch! After watching the whole film, I think "Spectre" is a good film but there are too many illogical moments that makes you wonder how did that just happen. To enjoy it, just follow the movie logic, and don't question anything in the film!This Bond Delivers More Than it Disappoints¬ÖA Bit Underrated The 24th James Bond Film and Daniel Craig's 4th outing as 007 has plenty of Thrills and Spills but is also not without its Shortcomings.  The Pre-Title Scenes are Full of Flurry and Fury and Impress with some Stunning Camera Work, Visuals and Effects. The Title Sequence is a Washed Out, One Color Yawner, even when the Octopus tries to Upstage and Surprise. The Song...Well those High-Notes are Painful and One Imagines the Singer in a Bond Torture Device forced to the Limits of a Human Vocal Performance. It's Painful. The most Disappointing Thing is the Underwhelming Appearance of the SPECTRE Organization and Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) in particular. The Titular Global Crime Syndicate (whose acronym is never explained) seems Underfunded and generally Boring and Bland. Although it does make sense that in 2015 Their attempt to Take Over the World is Focused on the Surveillance of "Everyone". A Topical Warning. The Action and Chase Scenes, Along with the Hand-to-Hand Unleash the Adrenaline. The Bond Girls are Nothing to get too Excited about though, unless You want Your Bond Girl to be more of a Brilliant, somewhat Plain Home-Spun. The Musical Score can be a bit Repetitive but it can Race the Heart at times. Overall, a Good Entry in the Series. Entertaining as Expected. But one Last Thought on the whole Craig Series. There may be too much Emphasis on the "Personal Bond". It has come to the point of "No More Please", after all, Bond is Better as a Fictional Super-Spy and there really is No Need to Know so much about His Life Outside the Agency. It is Doubly Unnecessary to Make Stuff Up, Biographically, that Isn't from the Ian Fleming Stories.Not As Good As "Skyfall" But Better Than "Casino Royale" The 24th entry in the James Bond film franchise, Oscar-winning "American Beauty" director Sam Mendes's "Spectre," tops "Casino Royale" (2006) and "Quantum of Solace" (2008), but it doesn't surpass "Skyfall" (2012). Ultimately, despite a variety of problems, this globe-trotting 007 outing boasts enough good stuff to offset the bad. If picturesque settings, robust performances, sumptuous production values, and a lavish $250 million plus budget constituted the bottom line for a cinematic blockbuster, "Spectre" would rank as the best ever Bond. Unfortunately, several factors undermine "Spectre,"including Sam Smith's mellow theme song, sophomoric scripting, lackluster villains, and a sluggish 148 minute running time. The above-average but formulaic screenplay by "Gladiator's" John Logan, regular Bond scribes Neal Purvis &amp; Robert Wade, and "Edge of Tomorrow's" Jez Butterworth generates occasional spontaneity. The scenes depicting a brawl aboard a helicopter and later on an aircraft crashing into a convoy of vehicles amount to exciting milestones for the series. The car chase through Rome is thoroughly routine, and the fistfight above the train is more noisy than dangerous. Furthermore, the basic plot recalls the Tom Cruise espionage epic "Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation" where the CIA sought to disband the IMF. One of Bond's secondary opponents dreams and schemes about dismantling the double-O section, putting our protagonist out to pasture, and relying on a global satellite surveillance network to thwart terrorism. Despite these drawbacks and letdowns, "Spectre" benefits from an incomparable supporting cast. Ralph Fiennes distinguishes himself as Bond's new boss, M, while Ben Whishaw as Bond's quartermaster extraordinaire, Q, has more time to display his skills. Former wrestler David Bautista acquits himself admirably as Blofeld's chief thug, while Jesper Christensen is a hold-over from "Casino Royale" and "Quantum of Solace." If you're a Bond fan, you'll appreciate the homages to "From Russia with Love," "You Only Live Twice," "On Her Majesty's Secret Service," "The Spy Who Loved Me," "For Your Eyes Only," and "License to Kill." Naturally, Daniel Craig returns as pugnacious 007, and he guns down a score of hooligans, beds a couple of babes, and swaps blows with the biggest hulk of a henchman since Roger Moore's Bond grappled with Richard Kiel's humongous Jaws.  "Spectre" unfolds in Mexico City during the annual Day of the Dead festivities. James Bond has been shadowing Marco Sciarra (Alessandro Cremona of "Mal√®na"), and he discovers Sciarra and his cronies plan to explode a bomb in a crowded nearby stadium. Mind you, the new M (Ralph Fiennes of "Skyfall") didn't send Bond to pursue this dastard. Instead, 007 received a posthumous video from the former M (Judi Dench of "GoldenEye") about Sciarra. In the event of her death, M instructs Bond to kill Sciarra and attend his funeral. Bond tails Sciarra to Mexico City and eavesdrops on a conversation before Sciarra's conspirators spot him. A harrowing shoot-out ensues. One of Bond's bullets ignites the bomb, and the explosion collapses half a city block, with 007 narrowly escaping death. Predictably, M is furious about the international incident that Bond has precipitated. Of course, Bond says little about his reasons for killing Sciarra. Later, Bond sneaks off to Rome against orders to confabulate with Sciarra's widow Lucia (Monica Bellucci of "Shoot'em Up"), and he gate crashes a gangster summit. He runs afoul of the nefarious Mr. Hinx (David Bautista of "Guardians of the Galaxy") who pursues him. Simultaneously, M tangles with the new head of the Joint Intelligence Service, smarmy Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott of the BBC's "Sherlock"), who has merged MI5 and MI6. Denbigh wants to scrap the double-0 section and replace it with a Babel-like global satellite surveillance system codenamed "Nine Eyes." Although Denbigh has the ear of the Home Secretary, something about the mysterious conglomeration of private backers who financed his project bothers M. Meantime, Bond races off to rescue another damsel, Madeleine Swann (L√©a Seydoux of "Blue Is the Warmest Color"), who identifies the criminal organization that Bond has been investigating as 'Spectre.'  If you haven't seen Daniel Craig's earlier James Bond escapades, you may be baffled by some of the events and characters. Not only does "Spectre" bring a sense of closure to Craig's previous Bonds, but it also reunites our redoubtable hero with his career-long nemesis‚ÄîErnst Stavro Blofeld. For the record, James Bond has been contending with Blofeld as far back as the original Sean Connery 007 epics in the 1960s. Although we didn't see Blofeld in "Dr. No," we caught glimpses of him with his white cat in "From Russia with Love" and "Thunderball." Finally, Blofeld appeared in plain sight in "You Only Live Twice," "On Her Majesty's Secret Service," "Diamonds Are Forever," and "Never Say Never Again." We got a glimpse of him again in "For Your Eyes Only," but "Spectre" represents the first time since "Never Say Never Again" that Blofeld has stepped into the limelight. Oscar-winning character actor Christoph Waltz of "Inglourious Basterds" comes out of the shadows and confronts Bond late in the third quarter of "Spectre." Waltz makes a terrific villain, but Mendes and his scripters have short-changed him on screen time. Blofeld's final infamy sends Bond scrambling frantically in search of the plucky heroine at the old MI 6 building poised to be blown to smithereens. This ticking time bomb scene recalls the finale of the Sylvester Stallone movie "Expendables 3." Sadly, unlike a traditional James Bond movie, "Spectre" furnishes 007 with few ingenious gadgets. He is reduced to wearing a wristwatch that comes with an alarm clock bomb. Most of Blofeld's staff consists of executives or clerical staff, and Blofeld's gunmen are terrible shots. It is only when the end credits roll that we learn the name of Blofeld's chief henchman that David Bautista portrays. Mr. Hinx should have lasted longer than he does. Indeed, he should have shown up for the finale in the MI 6 building, so he could prevent Bond from escaping with Madeleine Swann.  Altogether, "Spectre" lacks sufficient spectacle to overshadow "Skyfall."Craig continues to prosper as James Bond (in possibly his swan song turn as 007 if rumor has it) and does so with a bang SPECTRE (2015) ***1/2 Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ralph Fiennes, Monica Bellucci, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Dave Bautista, Andrew Scott, Jasper Christensen, Alessandro Cremona, Stephanie Sigman (cameo: Judi Densch) Craig continues to prosper as James Bond (in possibly his swan song turn as 007 if rumor has it) and does so with a bang: out to avenge the recently departed M as well as confront the nefarious leader of the titular conspiracy group hellbent on sabotaging international security at any cost. Waltz is slimily evil as the notorious Blofeld and a continuing supporting crew for Bond including aces-up-his-sleeve Fiennes as the new M, spunky and sexy Harris as Moneypenny and crafty Whishaw as Q. Bautista's near mute turn as a brute echoing Robert Shaw's blond Russian thug of "From Russia With Love" and Richard Kiel's Jaws from Roger Moore's pair of flicks is indeed formidable and chilling. While there is little believable chemistry between Craig and new Bond gal Seydoux there is the little-used but always welcome sultry Bellucci to spice things up. Director Sam Mendes returns to the franchise pulling out all the stops including a one-take non-cut opening salvo pre-credit trek thru Mexico City's Day of the Dead ceremony with Bond tracking an assassin that involves a crumbling hotel and one helluva vertigo inducing chopper sequence. Fast, fun and fierce and by all means make sure to see it in a big-screen/IMAX venue just to invision an 80 foot high Bellucci :DNot Skyfall but Still Electrifying. Spectre (2015): Dir: Sam Mendes / Cast: Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ralph Finnes, Monica Bellucci: Sam Mendes scores again although not quite up to the level of his previous Bond outing Skyfall. This one regards the organization called Spectre that is responsible for terrible events but also has ties with agent 007 James Bond himself when he learns that the mastermind is related to him. Daniel Craig once again portrays Bond who is terminated by M when he undergoes a mission in Mexico on his own that results in an opening action scene that has him narrowly avoiding a collapsing building. Christolph Waltz plays the villain whose father helped raise Bond, and due to jealousy he killed his parents. This is one of Bond's most vicious enemies as he uses a machine to torture him that involves drilling needles into the skin. Lea Seydoux plays Dr. Madeleine Swann whom Bond swore to protect after her father commits suicide. Her father gave information to Bond beforehand that involved his former union with Spectre. Swann is a psychologist whom Bond will obviously fall for and race the clock in hopes of saving. Ralph Finnes as Bond's superior M realizes his mistake in terminating Bond and attempts to correct corruption within his own ranks. Monica Bellucci plays the sexy widow of an assassin whom Bond had brought down in the film's opening. With over the top yet blazing action sequences, this outing employs entertainment at its highest with an ending that could followup a sequel idea. In the meantime Bond gets the girl and the nifty sports car. Score: 8 / 10Poor plot. It seems like an Austin Powers movie Really poor plot!!! Just like an Austin Powers movie: 1) Bond discovers the villain is his brother  2) This bad guy decides to kick the table Bond is siting to announce his arrival, rather than just kill him. That becomes a huge fight in which Bond wins, of course.  3) The villain (his brother) decides to drill Bond's head just for fun rather than kill him.  4) The villain decides to detonate a building with Bond inside, what gives him 3 minutes to run, instead of putting a bullet in his head.  5) And, of course, he is always shagging the lady's before, during and after action.Leaves a lot to be desired My 6 out of 10 rating is solely due to the entertaining action and location shots- but even that felt short of what you'd expect. How could they spend so much money on a movie and come up with something so... lacking? The main issues arise from the lack of plot development, there wasn't a good flow and it felt disjointed at times, they never fully explored themes/back stories/relationships with any of the characters/implications of what was happening, it all seemed too condensed and contrived to work. I was willing to overlook the laughable script because it's only Bond, right? so a camp script is meant to be allowed.  Most of the time I forgot there was any plot line, I don't think there has been an effectively stylised (Daniel Craig's) 'Bond' film since Casino Royale, the ingredients of that film worked, perhaps Martin Campbell actually had a vision that he implemented flawlessly, whereas one could easily peg this as Sam Mendes' worst piece of work, almost as if they gave him too much money to care.  Give it a miss in the cinemas, (unless you are up for an action and there's nothing else decent on) I'd wait for it to come on sky movies, they don't deserve a penny more than they've already made!Superb Entertainment I'm not a lifelong James Bond fan by any means and didn't come to the franchise until Daniel Craig took over the title role. I've enjoyed all four of the Craig interpretations since. From the opening titles of Spectre with its creepy tentacle sex to the spectacular Day of the Dead in Mexico City, to the final scenes in London, this movie was just pure entertainment. It's not deep. It's not something I'm going to over-analyse. Craig is great: funny (if you like the British curled lip type of humour), fit as hell, vicious, credible. The action is almost non-stop. There a very strong retro feel to the movie: Bond's suits are incredibly 1960s, the interior of the villain's lair filled with G-Plan and Ercol if I'm not mistaken. The final shot of the whole movie is a nod to the franchise's iconic history. Personally I hope Craig does stay for another film. He is Bond for me. Great job.Best James Bond Film Yet I know not many agree that this is the best Bond film but I think it is. I was very excited for this film from the moment I heard the title, I couldn't wait to see SPECTRE make a return. It is a perfect blend of ideas from old films with new ides. I loved how it linked all of the other Daniel Craig films together. It definitely made for an intriguing plot. Hearing how SPECTRE and Blofeld influenced everything that happened kept me glued to the screen. It made SPECTRE seem very powerful and threatening. I think Christoph Waltz put in an amazing performance as Ernst Stavro Blofeld. I thought he was menacing and mysterious. The torture scene he was involved in was incredibly tense and scary and worked very well. He was well backed up by his henchman (Dave Bautista) who was very much based on other famous henchman from previous Bond films. This film provides a satisfying end to the Daniel Craig era but does leave one more film as an option if he wants to do another. For the record I'd love to see one more with Craig going against Waltz. Overall I think this is a great film with some great action scenes, a great Bond villain and a great story line. Any long time James Bond fan should love the references to old films but that doesn't mean it can't appeal to new fans. I would recommend this film to anyone but it shouldn't be watched without watching Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall first.One of the Best Bond Movie Ever! I am a huge fan of James Bond movies. I loved this movie and truly enjoyed a lot. The movie is full of suspense action, drama and excellent stunts. This Bond movie is one of the best bond movie of all time and Director Sam Mendes did another masterpiece in his carrier.  Daniel Craig action sequences are astonished and he did a great job in his carrier. Lea Seydoux looks gorgeous and Christoph Waltz Villain Role is impressive. All the characters did their part very well ( Ralph Fiennes, Dave Bautista, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Monica Bellucci etc...) This movie is nicely connected all the previous Craig's Bond movies.The locations of the movie is visually superb and outstanding. The movie start to end is marvelous.  Finally the movie is worth watching movie for James Bond fans and others also...A Masterpiece A lot of people were worried about Spectre, and a lot of people disliked it.  After seeing it, I must say it has to be added to the classics along with Goldfinger, From Russia with Love, Octopussy, etc. Everything that James Bond is about and everything that a James Bond movie can be about: intrigue, gadgets, women, explosions, fights are in this incredible picture.  It is an absolute must see of our generation. Christoph Waltz again delivers on an incredible level and Daniel Craig is at his best James Bond. The leading ladies we find in Monica Bellucci and Lea Seydoux are all we could ask for in James Bond Girls.  The clich√©s that people worry about seeing in every other movie are perfectly added to Spectre and do not overpower the incredible plot.  There is a reason James Bond has had 24 movies to date and Spectre gives plenty of reasons to keep on having many more, hopefully directed by Sam Mendes and with music by Tom Newman.An excellent Bond movie I will explain to You why I liked this movie so much. Actually, except Casino Royale, I never cared about the restart of the franchise. But I can tell You one thing - Craig is the best Bond. Now, when this movie returned to the Formula of the Franchise, it is 10 out of 10, because everything is here: the Bond villain is now the classic one, the secondary villain like Jaws or Oddjob, the girls, the cars, the unbelievable explosions and shooting in an unimaginable way. But it is also a Craig movie. He is continuing his journey - the story, that begun in Casino is now at some point that we could call a great ending. But something tells me this is not an end... It's only a stop for a while...Just to make us take a breath...A Top Notch Addition to the Daniel Craig 007 Films I have been a huge fan of Daniel Craig's portrayal of James Bond since 2006's "Casino Royale", but I also noticed that that film's immediate sequel, "Quantum of Solace", was a bit of a letdown after the former movie's strong performance. With the third film, "Skyfall", having reclaimed a great reputation for the franchise, I went into this fourth installment of the Craig movies with a bit of trepidation. Would "Spectre" live up to "Casino" and "Skyfall", or will the franchise be doomed to see-saw back and forth so that every even-numbered movie in the series is a letdown? To my great pleasure, I can now report that "Spectre" is a wonderful 007 movie! In fact, that's so much the case that I've done a rare thing and rated this movie as a perfect 10/10 stars. I do that for very few films, and definitely not for very many sequels. But I've chosen to do so for "Spectre" because as much as I was fearful about the film and as much as my fear made me view it with a critical eye, I really couldn't find much not to like.  This was a classic Bond film in that it followed the series' formula for scripts quite well. Unlike "Skyfall", there wasn't a lot of back story or the introduction of elements of Bond's youth. And unlike "QoS", the script's story was well paced and told well. I felt like it all came together to produce a fantastic addition to the 007 movies. If I had any lone minor criticism, it might simply be that unlike the 007 movies of the past, the Daniel Craig films do all share a common chronology, and so there are certainly hints of the three previous movies that pop up in "Spectre". As such, if you've not seen the other movies lately, you may want to go back and re-watch the three previous films if you want to get the most out of your entertainment dollar. Otherwise you may be a bit lost over things like the recent death of Judi Dench's "M", the mention of past villains, etc. Still, this is simply to note that the film is in fact a sequel, not a standalone movie. It doesn't make it a bad film in the slightest, which is why I've maintained its perfect score. But it is worth noting that it wouldn't hurt to watch the other movies first. Finally, I'd just add that Dave Bautista makes for an awesome Bond villain. The same can be said for Christoph Waltz, although that's only particularly true at the end of the movie. I don't know enough about the earliest 007 films to know if Waltz's character was meant to pay homage to Connery-era Bond villain, or if he was meant to actually be a reenactment of such a character, but he reminded me of some villain that I've seen in passing from that era even though I haven't watched those films. But again, it's a great movie with a great cast and great characters! So, 10/10!A mind blowing movie. I have always used the impressive database on IMDb, but after seeing Spectre I had to sign up just to try and put into words what I think about this movie. I am not putting the spoilers as you may not have seen this. Better then Casino Royale and 100 times better then Quantum of Solace, it is perhaps not better then Skyfall, but it is equally as good. The beginning of the movie is incredible, scenes like that don't belong in average movies, only blockbusters. As a life long fan of the James Bond movies this is an excellent addition. It may be the last one for Daniel Craig, it felt like, but I hope for more. Star of the show is Q, he stole the scenes he appeared in. The best Bond villain for a long time.The Best Bond Movie of all time Watched Spectre Starring Daniel Craig(Cowboys &amp; Aliens) as James Bond/007, Ralph Fiennes(The Grand Budapest Hotel) as M Bond's New Boss , Dave Bautista(Guardians Of The Galaxy) as Mr.Hinx Oberhuasers Muscle ,Ben Winshaw(Paddington ) as Q Bond's Armorer an Assistant, Rory Kinnear(Quantum Of Solace) as Bill Tanner, Lea Seydoux(Mission:Impossible- Ghost Protocol) as Madeleine Swann my favorite Bond Girl. Naomie Harris(Pirates Of The Caribbean) as Eve MoneyPenny,Monica Bellucci(The Matrix Reloaded) as Luica Sicarra and Christoph Waltz(Inglorious Basterds,Django Unchained) as Franz Oberhauser/Ernst Blofield The films Main Villain. also the film is high octane thriller and it shows Why Global Surveillance is Wrong it also Linked The Previous 4 Bond Films Le Chiffre,Dominic Greene,Mr.White And Silva were all Part Of Spectre also I enjoyed That The Film Had Humor and wasn't Super Serious also amazing Production design from Dennis Gassner(Waterworld), Costumes Design by Jany Temime(Children Of Men),Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema(Interstellar),Score By Thomas Newman(Serenity), Screenplay By John Logan(Gladiator), Neal Purvis(Quantum Of Solace), Jez Butterworth(Live.Die.Repeat:Edge Of Tomorrow) and Direction from Sam Mendes(Skyfall ) 10/10Holey crap Craig, hopefully for the last time, once again yawns his way through a non existing scenario as he gets send once again on an errand to save the world. Sporting some beautiful locales, explosions and hand to hand combat scenes, what the film was actually about, was lost in the noise of people scratching their heads as they watched it. Familiar faces come and go as the nonsensical script lines fly across the 7.1 spectrum in a lame attempt to obscure the fact that apparently no one in the cutting room had an inkling as to the intended sequence of the individual scenes.  Even compared to your run of the mill action thriller time-waster, Spectre Skyfalls short on every aspect one could think of when reviewing a film. A film with Connery and Moore watching a freshly painted wall dry, while they talk about their glory days portraying Bond, would have easily been more entertaining.Unmemorable, rubbish, unoriginal, Craig's talent wasted Sam Mendes needs to stop directing Bond films. He doesn't understand the essence of the Bond franchise. But for some magical reason, Skyfall received many positive reviews that it didn't deserve and made the producer a lot of money that it once again didn't deserve. Mendes perceives and portrays Bond as an avant-garde grade character. Marc Foster did something similar by cutting Bond's credit line in Quantum of Solace which I found to be ludicrous and sappy. Let's be real here and they need to stop hiring these artsy film directors like Foster and Mendes who are more interested in perusing their own artistic expression than the true interpretation of the Bond franchise. Mendes' beautiful cinematography overshadowed all the mishaps and clich√© plots (presumably copycats of other spy movies) in Skyfall. This time Mendes decides to mix up little of everything from previous James Bond movies, creating one spectacular mediocrity. This explains its long length and inconsistency. Mr. Hinx and Oberhauser are not Bond grade villains. Bellucci is just too old (thanks to feminism) and Seydoux is just too average (thanks to MI:5) to be in the Bond franchise. This won't be your Martin Campbell's Casino Royale which I highly praise, this will be Sam Mendes' wannabe-die another day... mehh.Please no more Craig as Bond James Bond ha ha what a joke, John Bland is more appropriate and that's being generous. What a struggle it was to watch this tedious self indulgent drivel, I only held on with the expectation that there must be some substance, depth, engagement or humour on its way, but no just more repetition of the same (help). And D. Craig's Bond wanting to be more emancipated and playing the strong silent (dull and boring) type was exhausting, which you will be if you manage to stay the distance, exhausted, drained and needing a big drink, any drink will do as long as its not vodka martini (don't tell Ian Fleming). The promotion was better.The worst bond film ever created I suppose that if I have to point out one single good element in the whole film that would be Ms Bellucci.  Other than that, the inability of the film to grasp the viewers attention, the lack of spice and emotion and the absence of a good soundtrack, has made me regret viewing this motion picture.  The plot was not consistent, very slow, not enough action not enough gadgets not enough cars and no love scenes.  Perhaps, a little research would have helped the makers of this production understand better the legacy of Bond. Shame.Dire Total waste of time. Shoddy acting, terrible script. Why make a turkey like this?
More of the same This is the Mission Impossible format: Intro. Tom Cruise in the middle of a mission in some far away country fighting bad guys while doing unbelievable physical feats. 2. Tom Cruise receives a new mission he always accepts, 3. He then gets attacked by bad guys or framed by the organization who wants to destroy the world, 4. He meets hot interracial girl who always tries to kill him but he ends falling in love for her, 5. He sets up a team to find out the bad guy and usually to get what bad guy needs, 6. He trespasses some impossible place were humans cannot access and finds a way to get what the bad guy wants. 6. He finds bad guy with what he needs and never gives it to him and gets tortured in exchange(he can also get tortured at the beginning mission too). 7. He beats bad guy. 8. Team is happy and end of story. Facts Tom Cruise never dies and never gets badly injured. He always disables self destructing devices at the last millisecond. He is a genius who can crack any code, memorize anything and figure out any puzzle. He never rides motorcycles with a helmet. At least once in every MI movie he disguises as the bad guy or semi-bad guy.Christopher McQuarrie makes this the best entry in the series yet! Having seen the previous four 'Mission Impossible' films, I have to admit that none of them impressed me to the degree that I had hoped. I guess my expectations for action thrillers centering on secret agents were set too high because I saw the 'Bourne' trilogy and Daniel Craig's James Bond films first. The first three 'MI' films all seemed a little too slow, cheesy or convoluted on my first viewing. The fourth one was pretty good, even if the story does feel a little forgettable So, where does that bring me for the fifth entry of the franchise? My expectations were set at average around this time, despite all the good word-of-mouth I've been hearing. However, it wouldn't have mattered if my expectations were set around the same level for the latest 'Bourne' or James Bond film (very high) ‚Äì 'MI:5' blew everything I'd expected from it and then some!  Where to begin? The film possible contains the biggest, and possibly best, story out if all the other installments. It is fascinatingly complex and dynamic ‚Äì moving from country to country, dealing with characters who have questionable allegiances ‚Äì all on top of Ethan Hunt trying to outrun the CIA while trying to get to the bottom of what the Syndicate really wants. It may seem like a lot, but the script is really well structured and paced. Even though the film does take a few liberties with how some of its characters will ultimately act in the end, the plot isn't nearly as predictable as one would make it out to be. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie also manages to squeeze in some surprisingly silly moments at the most random of moments. The action scenes in this film are also some of the best in this franchise. Soon after showing Ethan Hunt take off on the side of an airbus, the film kicks it into overdrive and delivers an adrenaline rush packed with REALLY well done car chases, okay hand-to-hand combat scenes (they're kind of choppy), and ONE very suspenseful, pulse-pounding scene involving multiple snipers. McQuarrie's direction over the editing of these sequences is incredibly nuanced ‚Äì so much so that I found myself repeatedly leaning over the edge of my seat with excitement. People who weren't fans of the cheese factor (forced romances, convenient gadgets, and the overuse of face masks) of the previous films would be glad to know that it's been done away with in this film. And for people fearing that this is a film that takes itself too seriously, let me be one of the first to say: it doesn't. One may draw parallels between the events that have happened in this film to some of the recent events in our world, but I see it as a clever way for the franchise to keep up with our times. 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' is without a doubt one of the most exciting films I've had the pleasure of experiencing this year. It completely took me by surprise with how well-done it was, and should just about take anyone else to the same conclusion.Thank You! A Must See! All I can say is Thank You!!! This is what I want to see when I go to the movies looking to enjoy a good summer blockbuster!!! Man, talk about a fun ride. It was humorous, exciting, thrilling, suspenseful, and well worth the price of admission. Tom Cruise really gets it when it comes to entertaining your average moviegoer and he doesn't disappoint. But the truth is, no one disappoints in this summer flick. All parties brought their 'A' game and played their part perfectly. The female lead (Rebecca Ferguson) really held her own alongside Ethan Hunt and the crew and hopefully we'll see her in future installments, if there is more. Based on this current installment, there should definitely be more. MI:1 is a classic in my eyes and I've watched it countless times, but I must say, Rogue Nation...well, it's a lot more fun and I do feel it is a better film overall. I will be watching this one again and again. And don't wait for it to come to video...this is a movie you must see in theaters for the full experience. Also, let me just say the stunt sequences are thrilling...thrilling I say!! Very limited CGI in this film, which made the action scenes even more exciting and dare I say it again...thrilling! Lots of gasp worthy moments. I won't give away any spoilers as that would ruin the exciting action sequences and fun twists. This is enjoyable from beginning to end. So just go see it!!!Seen it all before I'm a fan of Tom Cruise and really like the last movie in the franchise but I couldn't get over the feeling that I'd seen it all before. Every hair raising stunt, every corner Ethan Hunt is backed into you just know he's going to win. The movie itself was good but for me it seemed a little stale. The action sequences were huge and impressive but it just seems that Hunt is indestructible. He can ride one of the fastest super-bikes in the world and crash without a helmet and the guy doesn't even get a gravel rash! I know other people are loving it so don't let my lack of enthusiasm put you off going to the cinema to see it. It's certainly worth the ticked price.Decent but not one of the best MI movies This is another decent addition to the Mission Impossible series but it wasn't one of the best. It's missing the two most important ingredients: 1. Interesting characters, especially bad guys (think Vanessa Redgrave in MI or Philip Seymour Hoffman in MI3). I hate to say it but Tom Cruise is easily the best actor in Rogue Nation. 2. Thrilling set-pieces (the break-in scene from MI, or the skyscraper scene from Ghost Protocol). Rogue Nation's underwater security hack just didn't quite cut it for me. Aside from that, it is a perfectly good spy/action flick. The fights are good. Ethan Hunt and Lane (the bad guy) keep outwitting each other in a pretty decent plot. But it didn't grip me like some of the other MI movies have.This franchise just keeps getting better and better! You would think that after five films this would have become a tired premise, but the way that it takes on the spy genre as both an intelligent espionage thriller as well as a big-budget blockbuster makes it even better than the new James Bond films.  It's exciting, slick, cool and fun, but this series, most of all in this film, has got an amazingly inexhaustible energy to it that makes it so brilliant. Let's start, then, with the main attraction of this film: the action. Simply, it's stunning. There are five separate big action sequences here, each lasting around ten minutes more or less, and they are all high-octane thrill-rides that never let up and make this such an entertaining film. Tom Cruise proves once again that he's a blockbuster star like no other, giving his all in the action here, whether it's attaching himself to a plane, jumping in a chasm of water or riding a superbike through the desert (in what was, in my opinion, the greatest, most exhilarating car chase ever). On that note, actually, the incredible bike chase is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the great action, but credit has to go to director Christopher McQuarrie for excellently turning this into a good-looking and intense action thriller, using great camera work (avoiding shaky cam) to make it so brilliantly entertaining. Away from the stunts, this film has still got a very good plot to it. There are few blockbusters that couple great action and intelligent storytelling nowadays, but this really bucks that trend, because it's absolutely enthralling to follow from start to finish. There are betrayals and deceptions galore in this spy thriller, as well as a genuinely exciting climax, which is so unpredictable that it makes you forget about the generic plots of the less successful films and be properly engrossed in the current story. Finally, this is also a very nice film to look at, thanks both to McQuarrie's direction, as well as the beautiful sets and landscapes that this is set in all over the world.  From the mesmerising desert of Morocco to the foggy alleys of London, this is a global journey that goes even further than the previous films, and comes out with a stunning result, the best of the series in my opinion! www.themadmovieman.comHighly Entertaining After another operation breaking the protocol, CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) decides to shutdown the IMF. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is trying to prove the existence of the evil organization The Syndicate but he captured by his agents. However he succeeds to escape with the help of mysterious Syndicate agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). Trapped in London, Ethan requests support from William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) that tells him that can not do anything to help him since the IMF does not exist anymore. The lonely Ethan decides to follow his only lead, the rogue Syndicate agent Lane (Sean Harris). A couple of months later, Ethan summons his friend and former colleague Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) to go to Austria to help him since he believes the Syndicate will try to assassin the Austrian Chancellor during the opera Turandot. Ethan saves the Chancellor from three snipers but he is killed by a bomb in his car. One of the snipers is Ilsa that gives a lead of Lane's scheme to Ethan. Who is the agent Ilsa Faust? Will Ethan be capable to prove that the Syndicate does exist?  "Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation" is a highly entertaining action film. The fast-paced development of the plot does not give time to think and the viewer sees a very enjoyable film. The unknown Rebecca Ferguson has a beautiful face and performs a key character that will be on the next movie of this franchise. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "Miss√£o: Imposs√≠vel - Na√ß√£o Secreta" ("Mission: Impossible - Secret Nation")Mission ACCOMPOLISHED! Me and a friend again had the opportunity to see an early screening of the movie 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation'. One word. Excellent. Everything about that movie was just perfect! It had the right amount of every element that would make a movie simply brilliant! This sequel for me, was definitely the best Mission movie yet. And at the same time it recalls so many details from the first mission impossible movie. And most of all the action. WOW. Every action scene in this movie was breath taking and there will be moments when you would just want to get up and start clapping. They did a good amount of the stunts without CGI and that will make you appreciate the action even more. Oh and if you thought that plane scene in the trailer was crazy, then you are in for a treat! When it comes to acting, Tom Cruise easily convinces us that he is a top notch agent of IMF(Impossible Mission Force). This time every member of the team has something to give in comparison to Ghost Protocol. Kudos to Simon Pegg for his impeccable timing for humor. And the villain was perfect! They made the villain perfect for the IMF and the ending of this movie is so satisfying. One of the few movies where the ending just pleases you so much. On the whole, Don't miss this movie!! Seriously.. Don't! It is a movie mean't to be watched by everyone!This Is What An Action Film Should Be I saw this film on an IMAX screen and I'm glad I did. Although IMAX cameras were not used in the filming, I think the larger screen creates a more immersive experience and the sound was spectacular. But this film would be great in any format. "Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation" is one of the best action films I have ever seen. The story is clever and action packed. The photography is amazing and the music is fantastic. Much has been made of the stunt work, especially that done by Tom Cruise himself. It did not disappoint. And the action and chase sequences are as exciting as any I have seen. We can thank the writing for the well-defined and engaging characters. Some Bond films have villains that are rather cartoonish, but in MI:RN the danger feels real, helping to drive the suspense. The female lead, Rebecca Ferguson, deserves special mention. Her portrayal of Ilsa Faust is a wonderful blend of intelligence, beauty and strength and definitely one of the best in any action film. I can only hope she shows up in the next installment. some of the credit goes to the writers who created the character. In all, this film offers everything you want in an action film and deserves a "10" for its place in the genre.Quite predictable, pretty unrealistic and still very enjoyable. Quite predictable, pretty unrealistic and still very enjoyable. That being said, this movie is everything you can expect it to be. Quick and interesting action and even if you can predict what's gonna happen next (sometimes precisely to a second) you still will enjoy seeing how they made it happen. As for acting: Rebecca Ferguson's lovely, Simon Pegg'g good, Ving Rhames Jeremy Renner and Simon McBurney are adequate for their characters, and Tom Cruise... well he's the way he is, if you love him you'll love him here and if he annoys you... ;) All in all it's an action movie and if that's what you expect than you surely won't be disappointed.Entertaining without being over the top! TL;DR: Visually stunning, action filled and down to earth action sequences (no over the top BS). Storyline with nice twists and pretty good for an action movie, though watching Ghost Protocol helps getting to know the IMF crew (there's no introduction this time around). **spoiler-free** Rogue Nation, like the latest movies in the franchise and others in the spy/action genre, starts with a small crew, with little support, against huge odds, having to deal with challenges that seem impossible (no pun intended).  What makes Rogue Nation better than most is that it makes it all plausible without super-human characters, crazy gizmos (except one that I shaw not mention, but it is not overused like in M:I II), and brilliantly made down-to-earth action sequences. The latest 007 movies are following the same ideals, but M:I has made a solid choice of supporting actors (specially Simon Pegg) that add a subtle layer of comedy and improvisation, which helps a lot into building some suspense in the audience - it feels like as if they are as clueless as we are of what is going to happen. Another great aspect that sets this moving apart are the terrific action sequences which are paired with outstanding sound effects and music score (without spoiling, there is an entire action sequence that plays with this very aspect). Was lucky enough to watch a pre-screening on IMAX, and strongly recommend watching it on IMAX or a theater with a good audio setup.  The storyline, while not hard to follow, benefits from having watched at least Ghost Protocol, since key characters are back and lack some introduction, and the story somewhat picks from what took place in the last instance. Much like Ghost Protocol, the storyline packs some interesting twists and doesn't seem obvious - even though we all know that the good guys win, Rogue Nation adds some shady characters which are not as black and white, making for some interesting development. Overall a highly entertaining movie, packed with stunning action sequences and a storyline that is well thought-out and manages to keep the audience hooked until the end. A solid addition to the franchise that keeps one-upping itself on every new release.Most Explosive MI, Yet. Even two hours won't be enough for "Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation'" to be able to unravel all its exhilaratingly high-octane action and drama. This fifth installment in the franchise surges with death-defying action proceedings, riveting and pulsing with the relentlessness and explosiveness of its spiking adrenaline, to deliver the franchise's most thrilling outing, yet. That relentlessness is true and screaming right at the opening sequence of the film, where IMF agent, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), is seen dangling from the door of an airbus, already adrift in the air as it ascends even further to the skies. That's the first of too many, and you wouldn't care less of the logic behind such impossible knockout stunt demonstrations, because once the momentum crashes past the speedometer's limit, there's no other choice left but to get consumed by the electrifying influx of near-impossible action setpieces. This doesn't mean there's barely any sense to take in, in fact you would be awed to realize that in spite of its speed and strength-defying physicalities, characterizations are still working along the explosive chaos, and the behavior of the characters, and the emotional aspect of the narrative, still follows acceptable reasoning. The whole of 'Rogue Nation' can be seen as Hunt's team desperate attempt to keep IMF running, and save it, and the world it intends to protect, from extinction. This time, the major figure of terror, is the mysterious organization, 'The Syndicate', headed by the despicably steel-fisted Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) . Ethan is joined by co-IMF agent, William Brandt (Jeremmy Renner), and suspicious British agent, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). The comic effort comes mostly from Hunt's sidekick, Benji (Simon Pegg), and Brandt, who spends most of the time running and chasing after the shadow-terrorist group, The Syndicate. Much of the movie's strength emanates from its seemingly unstoppable delivery of edge-of-your-seat action, but you can't ignore the grandeur of its camera shots and the palatable efforts of its lead characters and supports. There's much to say about how inconsistent and illogical some of the narrative choices that the screenwritersn took are, but they get overshadowed by the more relevant, and on this case, more effectively utilized, high-tension action extravaganza. One can inevitably notice how Cruise has aged through the franchise's almost two-decade history. He's more tired-looking here, but you can't question his commitment to the franchise. In 'Rogue Nation', he's definitely back, running after, and wrestling against, the equally desperate claws of 'The Syndicate'. He hops across the world to trump the enemy, and in every city, he inevitably gets himself involved in deadly strangulations. At such moments, cinematography is top notch, and the breathtaking panorama becomes an exquisite backdrop for the ever-imminent rumbles. This is where this installment is strongest and most engaging, a strength that should warrant a sixth outing.Superb experience &amp; 2nd best movie in the franchise Almost a masterpiece. It contains everything you love about the movies. Suspense, mystery, drama, intelligent action &amp; plot. I did not expect the experience I got. A start to finish thrill ride which also contained intelligent characters &amp; plot. Christopher McQuarrie has crafted a superb movie which moves at a fast pace but also slows down when it has to for some intelligent character interaction. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances &amp; is in almost the entire movie. The rest of the cast are all great. Rebecca Ferguson is a strong character &amp; female equivalent of Ethan Hunt. Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner &amp; Alec Baldwin all give great performances &amp; have about the same screen time. The villains lead by Sean Harris are effective &amp; chilling &amp; also a little mysterious. Music is superb with many subtle bursts of the MI theme. The film does not contain hardly any CGI its nearly all practical real stunt FX. Overall it just works from start to finish &amp; Christopher McQuarrie has created a superb film experience which does not fail to entertain &amp; deserves repeat viewings to enjoy the experience again &amp; again. This mission should you chose to accept it is to enjoy the movie &amp; watch it at least once more at the cinema the way its intended to be seen on a massive screen with loud sound.Don't believe the hype, the worst sequel by far Saw it in the theater yesterday, couldn't wait for it to finish. Became very boring half way through, the plot is just childish and lacks any credibility or seriousness. I know this should be a no-brain summer flick, but M:I films always go for the shocks and suspense. It was non-existent here, the lack of any seriousness meant that nothing really moved me. Even the high-profile figure being assassinated didn't really mean anything because it seems that the whole world forgot about it the second after it happened.  The first film had a somewhat complicated plot, a few really breathtaking scenes and Tom Cruise young enough to deliver a fresh performance. The second film had a really silly plot, but the no- CGI motorcycle chase scene and Limp Bizkit soundtrack at least created some legacy. The third installment had a forgettable plot, but a really convincing bad guy played by the late Mr. Hoffman. The fourth film was silly enough, but the Burj Khalifa stunts made by Tom Cruise really stood out. This sequel has none of that. It relies purely on CGI and no plot development, it seems like characters jump from place to place without any motive or any explanation. I am aware of the fact that this lazy approach sells tickets these days, but in order to have a mission impossible really be a mission impossible it needs to have a context where it really seems serious and impossible. People who watched the first sequel remember that the Langley heist was introduced to the audience, planning was made and execution was slow, but exciting. This director could not deliver any of that.  I hope they stop now, I guess in the next sequel they could go into space or make Tom Cruise might fight a tiger in a cage. Even if he does it will be a CGI tiger, or a CGI Tom Cruise. In a CGI cage, with CGI blood. Big disappointment, really.liars on IMDb I went last night 8/7. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because chase credit card has a buy one get one free movie ticket on Fridays. Why everyone is raving about this bore shows people are paid to write reviews. How can anyone say 10 out of 10. MI 1 was and still is the best one of the franchise. The airplane scene? Big frigging deal why is that everyone's high point. It was 2 hours and 10 mins too long should of been a 1 hour 25 min movie. Was so drawn out. There was laughable scenes when cruise gets out of the car that had just flipped 10 times at 100mph. When he crashed the motorcycle with no helmet at 120mph he gets up with no damage like the terminator after being shot 20 times.  Save your money unless you get a buy one get one movie pass like I did. My chick and I walked out 1hr and 35 mins in. We couldn't take it anymore. The audience actually laughed a few times during this. Why? There was no comedy in this. A monotone bore. The first hour not 1 action scene after the stupid plane one in the beginning. I went out to a rock concert after that was more entertaining than this drivel. Some others walked out as well. The only good thing was the sour cream and chive popcorn and the fact the theater sells alcohol to numb the pain of this movie. San Andreas was better. On that note I'm off to play Xbox 360. It's more entertaining than this lame flickHere we go again... again I remember when I first saw this film in theaters and the lights dimmed the first thought that ran through my head was "Here we go again" as I released an involuntary sigh of apathy. Somewhere along the line, before seeing this latest installment, I had decided to re-watch the original four films and realized that the character of Ethan Hunt really has no defining characteristics beyond just basically being Tom Cruise. This bothered me for some reason. Jason Bourne was a fully fleshed out character and even the new Bond films had added newer elements to give a traditionally stereotypical character more depth and complexity, but Ethan Hunt is just...bland. He has no personality. What seemed even stranger to me was the fact that Mission Impossible was supposed to revolve around a team, yet Tom Cruise is seemingly always the only one who ever does anything. So basically these films boil down to watching Tom Cruise perform his own stunts, which I will admit are extremely impressive, especially in this latest escapade. However the plots of all five films are basically nonsense to try and connect each elaborate stunt to the next. Then I realized that all 5 films have remarkably similar story lines as well. Tom Cruise has a mission, something goes wrong, he goes rouge, needs to find some kind of MacGuffin, the villain is some kind of terrorist arms dealer, insert random forgettable love interest here, big stunts, the end. that being said, the film's action scenes are amazing, and really make you question the sanity of Cruise, who needlessly continues to insist on doing all of his stunts. Basically it's another Tom Cruise Hollywood blockbuster, which at the end of the day made me finally realize, "Why was I ever expecting anything else in the first place?"Best MI yet. Mission impossible Rouge Nation is directed by Christopher McQuarrie and stars Tom Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson, Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg. Most of the time when a series gets to its fifth movie, they ether have to reboot it some way or its just very bad but the mission impossible is not doing that, it is improving and getting better and better. Rouge nation might be the best MI movie yet, what makes it so great is that it takes parts of the other movies and puts them together. Rouge Nation adds more humor, more gadgets, more suspense, more everything. The acting was fantastic by everyone. Tom Cruise was amazing and the fact that he does all his stunts, just makes him one of the best action stars today. Simon Pegg stands out a lot in this one, they gave him more screen time, which is great because the chemistry between Cruise and Pegg is also great. The action was incredible and you could tell the actors were very doing it. Overall Rouge Nation was amazing and improved in everything. The action and acting was fantastic. Definitely needs to be seen in IMAX.Mission mediocrity - Ho hum; seen it all before. I don't understand why people seem so enamoured by this. It's like a made for TV James Bond on a bad day. Ethan Hunt isn't interesting. IMF isn't interesting. The first half was okay, but it soon degenerated into mediocrity. Too many characters, too many locations; no central focus or essential core. It wasn't really about anything. And the end; what a cop out. The writers just had to find a way to finish it; it felt rushed. I was bored with this film; it really wasn't great. And like MI:3 the music sucked; just noise pollution. Were any of the Mission Impossible movies ever that good? I don't think so. Just another movie to soon be forgotten about. Watch James Bond instead. Mission mediocrity.A Waste of Time and Money Saw the movie last Saturday, we both fell asleep during parts of the film. The length was too long and the dialog nearly incomprehensible. A terrible end to what was a good set of sequels. The opening scene was too staged and no clearly defined plot. Was that goof ball trying to open the doors did he not know Russian and on a mission inside of Russia! Unbelievable to say the least and not suspenseful or exciting in any form. The dialog between actors was so stilted as to be boring which causes us to nod off more than once during the film. MI in the past were not only exciting but kept you in suspense until nearly the very end, none of that this time around.Your mission should you choose to accept it... is try and not to fall asleep! Went to see it last night, after looking forward to it, but unfortunately I have to say that it is probably one of the worst MI films to date! The film virtually has no storyline that you can follow or make any sense from, relies on ludicrous stunts and action sequences and seem to full of more technobabble than an ST:TNG episode! Acting, whatever there was, was wooden and one dimensional. Even Tom Cruise/Ethan Hunt's bright shiny teeth couldn't save this film, you would have thought all he to do was smile and the villains would have been stunned, job done! Simon Pegg tried pull of a straight role, but seemed to look blank as confused as much as the audience. The film's main villain, was typically one dimensional, all he needed was a cloak and evil laugh then he was set. Unfortunately I cannot delete the film from my memory as easy they did with the stolen data. Also looks like we have another MI film to look forward to, looks like Tom Cruise is trying to beat Hugh Jackman's &amp; Robert Downey Jnr's record for playing the same character in film series, unlike them he has to rely sacrificing a decent storyline to do it. Just another excuse to get as much blood out of the stone while they can.How is MI5 not rated a zero? This is the first review I have ever done on IMDb...not because I don't like watching films..in fact, I adore films. Rather, I normally don't review just because I put a premium on my time, and don't want to spend time repeating what others may have already said about a given film; until today, that is. In my inaugural review, I was very motivated (I mean incensed) to write this review now having come back for the cinema, freshly infuriated in the realization that I can't get 2.5 hours of my life back after watching MI-5. I read glowing reviews before going to the film, to which I am now wondering if I saw the same film others who reviewed this film as "highly enjoyable". I am beyond puzzled how this film got good reviews, unless it is from reviewers who get easily bamboozled by special effects to forgive the need for a plot, or work for the makers of the film, or who are not of this earth. The planet to which these people who did liked this poor excuse for a "film" I do not know. Yes, I knew it would be an action film, and yes I knew one has to suspend disbelief to enjoy a film like this, but despite these prerequisites being in place in my mind going into the theater, this film content was so vacant and vapid it boggles my mind that I sat through its entirety and didn't walk out mid-film. The plot was not in the slightest way possible to follow, and the reviewers shouldn't confuse plot complexity (which a good story can have)with the nonsensical incongruity of this film. Tom Cruise--who was truly outstanding in Jerry Mcquire,the Firm, Vanilla Sky and Eyes Wide Shut-- was hardly that as an international spy. Mr Baldwin--another outstanding actor and wonderful in the Royal Tannenbaums and Blue Jasmine--but his role in this film was completely under-utilized. The other actors were alright, but its just that the plot and its presentation was just insulting to any intelligence. Endless product placements for BMW, and then when the locale of different places were indicated when they showed in an areal pan shot its a bit much to say show the US Congress and Washington Monument, combined with the need to type in the upper right corner..."Washington D.C.", just to make it look official and inform us that we are in Washington D.C. just in case one didn't know..I can't remember if the pan shot of Big Ben was accompanied by the words "London, England". If you are looking for a similar action/conspiracy spy film with slick international intrigue with believable characters, I highly recommend "The International" out a few years back. In sum, please, save your time, stay at home and watch paint dry for a more redeeming experience.Action Overkill, holed up plot, mediocre script...all in all felt like they should have given it more time. When it comes to entertainment, Tom Cruise is the one guy you can count on. His last release, Edge of Tomorrow, is a spectacular example of intelligent entertainment, with not a dull or lifeless moment in it. The last MI was the best action flick of the year. The reason it worked so well was that none of the action was forced and everything seemed to be in a flow.  Not so much in this one. Even the most publicized stunt, with Cruise hanging on the airplane in mid-air seemed too hurried and poorly executed. The plot seemed repeated and predictable.IMF in trouble, Ethan is the lone wolf..the one man army, throw a sexy female agent and a villain who talks funny, too many Beemers, multiple intelligence agencies with secrets of their own, and there you have it ! The only thing constant in the film was its flaws. Hunt running down a narrow pathway while a guy shoots him from behind with a machine gun from point blank range and ...guess what. Misses! The same with the bike chase scene. Too forced and too clich√©d. The casting was pretty much the same. New women, same guys, a villain so big that he controls major international happenings and disasters, can start wars with his actions, yet personally goes to murder a movie store clerk cum IMF sub agent while exposing himself to the 'living manifestation of destiny' ( cant believe that was an actual piece of dialog, uttered by the wasted Alec Baldwin). The only standout was Simon Pegg as Benji ' when the cuss am i gonna get to wear a mask' Dunn. The action in some scenes was mindblowing. The underwater scene was done well. Rest all ranged from mediocre to rubbish. McQuarrie and Cruise have had some fruitful collaborations in the past. Edge of tomorrow, Valkyrie, Jack Reacher all good movies. MI5 is the odd one out i guess.  Hope they come up with something new next time, not like this recycled James Bond wannabe mediocre-fest.Familiar Franchise Fare, but Flashily Ordinary Rogue Nation delivers set piece action and thrills to satisfy most of the intended audience, but basically they are rather hackneyed and fourth rate. They do not make up for the acres of empty space at the heart of the movie's plot and characterisation. Let alone the script and direction which are utterly predictable and gone through strictly by numbers. A just about good enough film that does not try too hard. After all, predictability is the key to a franchise success, or a dreadful bore to the uncommitted and unenthusiastic - there really is only an hour's TV episode material here. True, it carries it all off with gloss and panache, but then the Chinese backers would want to be sure on a return for their investment! Tom Cruise (looking older) gives his all-American, polished, believable performance we come to expect in his action genre films, while the support cast do their thing like moving wallpaper. Rebecca Ferguson flaunting her slightly heavy thighs at almost every opportunity is an interesting choice as the femme fatale (good or bad?), but Swedish/UK cool does not add a lot to a very clich√©d role. Sean Harris (unrecognisable) tries to method act the chief villain and still manages to make no impression. Just like Philip Seymour Hoffman in an earlier MI, you have to chew a bit of scenery rather than stay cold at a very great distance! Can we have a franchise-free (particularly comic-based ones) and Matt Damon not lost in space year of movies, please, and get back to some straightforward, effects-free entertainment that Hollywood used to do so well!?An awesome experience! My most anticipated movie of this year and luckily enough, I had the pleasure... the utmost pleasure of watching it at an advance screening! Loving Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol so much that I'd given it a near perfect rating, I was skeptical and expecting at least a bit of a letdown as I simply couldn't see how they'd top that. Also, I had only limited myself to 2 trailers as I already felt I knew far too much, which only increased my anxiety. Still, I couldn't help but have expectations; my excitement level had peaked before even going into the cinema! And the movie surpassed my expectations; just blew me away... multiple times. The best elements from all the previous four films are adapted and have been vastly improved upon. Sean Harris is the antagonist and he does a fantastic job of it. Cruel, mysterious, calculating, manipulating, menacing... just evil to the point that Hunt is at the end of his wits, feeling helpless. His luck seems to be running out... his skills, his way of operating, all his usual tricks and methods - they've all been exhausted and you are actually scared for him! The way this movie is presented to us, the audience, we aren't just viewing it; it's made to feel just as much of an experience. That's how the whole film is and I am in awe of the ingenuity. Just when you think you've got it all figured out - how the scene and then the movie are gonna play out, it twists &amp; turns and throws you off. And then, in the back of your mind, whilst taking in all of this unexpected awesomeness, you're off again... trying to figure out where that shot and the entire film is headed. It just takes you on an exhilarating ride. For the most part, the movie feels so perfectly realistic even with all the crazy awesomeness going on. And I love how unpredictable it was. In regards to the characters in general - actions taken by them, the pieces of dialogue they speak with everything occurring in the background and taking into consideration everything that has happened so far¬Ö you find yourself being uncertain what their motivations and intentions are, what they're thinking, what they are going to do next, what's going to happen, what's the plan, etcetera etcetera ‚Äì every character; not just the new ones but even the previously established ones. That is how exceptional the performances are, in tune with the direction of the story... the entire cast has their A game on! Also, there's a lot of humour, scattered all over the movie and that makes the movie more fun. There is development, too, with most of the characters - especially Hunt. The action in the movie is just insane... they went all out! From stunts to fight sequences and chases - absolutely sensational; it's like you're feeling every hit and every move. The whole scene where Tom Cruise actually clings onto the door of a plane while it's taking off - my heart was racing so fast. It was very well shot and the fact that he actually performed the insane stunt adds to the feeling; CGI just cannot compare. This intensity and excitement is constant throughout the movie, on some level. Also, Tom Cruise is riding a motorcycle once again and it is sweeeeeeeeeeeet! There's a scene of him running, as well, as usual. The cinematography is just spectacular and quite literally breathtaking throughout the film. Be it action sequences, landscape, anything... there's amazing wide-angle shots, there's POV shots that feel like you're really there, the whole lot. The movie looks and feels so great. The gadgets and gear in this movie are unreal! I don't mean they are unrealistic; they are believable in a very plausible-in-the-future way, creative and incredible.  There's more than a few things going on in the movie, yet none of it feels forced or unnecessary and it all works together very well. It runs at a tense, thrilling and suspenseful pace - in an enjoyable way. Not a single moment is wasted; every scene on the screen is essential and every shot is impeccably acted, directed and delivered. I could go on &amp; on about how every little aspect of the film was awesome, but to conclude, I loved it all. Also, TOM CRUISE IS A GODDAMN LEGEND!Boring I really enjoy MI series, however this one felt like it was missing all the things that make it interesting. I miss the comedic scenes, the suspense that is mixed with humour, the interesting gadgets that help get you into an impossible place also the interaction between the team members also absent. In the end I felt I could have watched the British woman all day, and had no interest in anything else, the rest was irksome. Do NOT waste your money to buy or go to the cinema just wait until its on TV and the adverts/commercials will give you more suspense!! Bottom line: Its the worst in the series!An ActionFest Flick - Shame The Story Wasn't As Good As The Stunts... This is an all-out actionfest. Right from the opening you've got Cruise (Ethan Hunt) holding onto the side of an aeroplane as it takes off - Bloody Nutter! This in most films would be the top stunt; this, of course, is MI so it's just your opening salvo of insaneness. It's the story which kinda lets it down. These have now become secondary to the stunts, which I have to say are superb - and not too much CGI (except for the tech stuff, that is). Here you have a secret organisation called The Syndicate (nope they don't rig the lottery). But as "syndicate" describes a group working towards an aim, then the name is wrong as it turns out to be one man controlling his own mercenary army. I think there would have been great scope had it actually been a syndicate with many heads like the hydra. There are a couple of holes in the story though they are minor... except for the ending... just how did the bad guy NOT think the scenario would turn out this way. Bit of a let down as he'd been ahead of Hunt and his team all through the film. In fact, the way Lane (Sean Harris) manipulates people is pretty awesome and is a good plot builder and twist creator. It's this element that keeps the story interesting. But in the end, Hunt has to overcome... it's just a shame that the ending wasn't as twist orientated as the rest of the story. I cannot fault the direction or the pace of the film, as McQuarrie, gives the audience an atmospheric and excitement filled rollercoaster ride of a movie. He is great at filming the fight scenes and chases as well as the drama set-up acting scenes. For example the car and bike chase between Hunt and Ilsa Faust (Ferguson). When Hunt's car crashes he slows down the action to build tension... and then to build to a comical end to that scene, before revving up the torque to near maximum for the rest of the chase. In fact, it's Rebecca Ferguson (Faust) that adds Kudos to the cast. She gives a fantastic performance as a strong-minded and deadly woman who happens to be beautiful and sexy to boot. She even has an air of secrecy and mystery to her. You are never too sure about her or her motives. This in some way is told by the story but a lot of it comes from Ferguson's portrayal of Faust. This is one actress to watch. She and her character really made this film for me. It's nice to have a new strong character as we've gotten used to the others. And to be honest when I see Cruise, Penn, Rhames, Renner and Baldwin I actually see them and not their characters as throughout the years they've become partially stereotyped. Which is a shame as it's this that lets the film down slightly. At least in MI III, the writers tried to give Ethan Hunt a deeper character, one with issues and problems - shame they didn't progress down that line. I would happily recommend this to all lovers of Mission Impossible and action films alike. There's not much you have to do as a viewer except sit back and enjoy... hopefully you'll make it to the edge of your seat a couple of times.Laughable and unapologetic Was this film laughable? Oh, yes. But while every recent comic book and spy movie desperately wants to be dark/serious (Hi, DC comics!) or meta (Hello, Deadpool!), the MI movies are a rare franchise: they are unapologetic. They are silly and ridiculous and excessive. No apologies. While Bond gets gritty, MI gets - well - fun. And suddenly we all remember that predictably comic thrill rides are worth the price of admission. Eventually, the Tom Cruise run will become the Jeremy Renner run. But the franchise will live. It just needs to remember that masks and twists are not a bad formula.Has Now Surpassed Bond In Terms Of Rollicking Action Fun I'm not usually the type that gets all too excited about action/adventure romp, but for the past, oh, 20 years of my life I've always been excited for the next James Bond movie to come out. My one indulgence in the genre. In recent years, however, that franchise has gone a bit stale, allowing the Mission Impossible franchise, including this "Rogue Nation" installment, to take the crown of best action movie. For a basic plot summary, "Rogue Nation" sees the IMF being shut down by the CIA Director (Alec Baldwin) right as they are on the verge of taking down the shadowy Syndicate, a network of crime baddies run by the mysterious Lane (Sean Harris). Now more off the books than ever before, the IMF team of Hunt (Tom Cruise), Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Luther (Ving Rhames) must track down Lane before they are out of time and resources. Lending a helping hand (or is it?) is British double-agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who seems to be playing all sides at once. Obviously, any "Mission Impossible" movie (especially those still under the helm of JJ Abrams' Bad Robot productions) is going to be judged on how riveting and pulse-pounding the action scenes are. "Rogue Nation" doesn't fail in that category one bit! From the opening scene of the film, which sees Tom Cruise perform one of the craziest stunts I've ever seen in a movie, the action scenes will blow you to the back of your chair. They are slick, have a great backing soundtrack, but also don't go on forever and ever. It never feels like the film is just a few extended action scenes cobbled together. Each action montage has a purpose. Along those lines, "Rogue Nation" manages to good from "okay action romp" to "really entertaining flick" due to the fact that it's able to weave an actual story into the proceedings. Not only that, but it's a story that will legitimately have you intrigued and guessing as to how everything will turn out. This is where the franchise really separates itself from the recent Bond efforts. Those films haven't had a great story since "Casino Royale", and before that it was "Goldeneye". That's two in about 20 years. Every since Bad Robot took the helm of the MI series, the three films have gotten progressively better. One final quick note about the MI/Bond comparison: These movies are far better at using female protagonists as well. Whereas the concept of "Bond Girls" is now at odds with the culture at large (unlike the franchise's heyday in the 60s and 70s), the MI films are able to utilize a sexy female lead who, at the same time, isn't just eye candy waiting to be bedded by the hero. So, despite the fact that Bond movies might still have more name recognition and gravitas behind them, the MI flicks have slowly crept up and taken their place as kind of the action/adventure romp. "Rogue Nation" is slick, smart, funny, a spectacle to watch, and even has a story that will keep you engaged. Hey, isn't that what the Bond franchise used to be able to do?An Excellent Addition To The Mission: Impossible franchise Tom Cruise returns to the role of IMF agent Ethan Hunt in this exciting, wonderful new installment. There are plenty of intense set pieces, including the opening plane scene and the wonderfully choreographed opera scene. The characters in this movie are okay, and Rebecca Ferguson delivers plenty of excitement and anticipation as Ilsa Faust, the mysterious new femme fatale whose motivations are never clear to the audience. The movie's main antagonist, however, is horrible and underdeveloped, and his motivations are never exactly clear. Why does he want to destroy the IMF? Is it because of the money? However, don't let this bloke spoil your enjoyment of the movie. My personal favourite set piece is the opera scene, which is ruined considerably by a twist at the end of the same scene. Nevertheless, this film is a wonderful addition to an already wonderful franchise.Must watch :) OK, guys, something's wrong with me. I am amazed by MI movie. Me who hates action movies and Tom Cruise... I could watch it again straight away. Cruise is bit older and much less irritating than usual, the rest of the crew is awesome, action scenes are adrenaline feast but the movie itself is not action movie any more. It's more of a spy thriller, and good one too. Movie starts fast and rushes faster and faster till the perfect ending. I could not find any weak spots in this sequel and it definitely is the best one so far. I gave it 9/10 only because 10/10 is reserved for the best movies of all times, classics of cinematography that will never grow old, and I could not go that far to put MI in same box with them. Although, if they continue to make every new MI better than previous I am afraid it might reach perfect 10 soon enough.  9/10Twists &amp; turns galore The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is that the overall emotional concept is a bit scattered. It's such a big team that the central character's personal stakes are not all that riveting. It's sort of a romantic tease for things to possibly come for Ethan though, so the fun factor overrides any lack of emotional angst. The theme is very interesting &amp; very clear, though words are seldom used to convey it: loyalty can be fickle. Such a theme lends to great twists &amp; turns. EVERY single character (except one minor bad guy) flipflops at least once in their loyalties (or seems to). It's a very complex roller-coaster that provides a really fun, knucklebiting ride as betrayals are followed by victories which are then undone by more betrayals, etc.  After several viewing it never gets boring. This is how an action film should be. Well done. Definitely my favorite in an ever improving series, which is rare. The biggest dud in the series is the first film, which in its time was a wonderful breakthrough &amp; still very watchable despite a very slower pacing. The trademark alternative realities given in flashforwards &amp; flashbacks continue to stand out as a fun element that keeps the mind engaged. Not sure how they'll top this one without getting formulaic.Its about time actions went back to being action films I could write a ten page report on this movie so keeping under a 1,000 words is super difficult for me. Thank you for getting back to what action movies are suppose to be. Car chase, fine women, violence, guns, and moves that make you go "wow that was original". This film set its own expectations for fight scenes. And it took Tom Cruise to do it. This man has been acting for well over 30 years. And still brings it in films. As I've said in other movie reviews I updated my blu ray collection and picked the 5 set of movies in a box set. I had to watch this one first. I've seen all the other ones except mission impossible one. And I was a huge fan of mission impossible two. I know some people might view this never have seen any mission impossibles wondering if this good. Don't ask your friends, just watch the movie. You also have to like action movies. If you like what everybody else likes and non original ideas based around comics you already have heard about or simply cartoons that you knew were coming out, this movie is not for you. If you are thinking you are going to see top gun or risky business (which by the way are my favorite, i own both on blu ray as well) then this isn't for you. Tom Cruise is a great actor and his sarcasm is easily a throw back to the james bond days. All characters in this movie were great actors. What more can I say about alec bladwin. Hes authority character he has done is so underrated in the filming industry its really sad. He played an authority character in The Departed and that was a 5 star movie. He just has a knack for drama and acting. Which he was the only person who added drama to this movie. And it was needed for making the plot come together. You can't really teach that. That was all alec baldwin.  As original as some things were, they were not original on the idea. Seriously this is your typical spy movie, james bond and jason bourne have made a killing on that. Have a target you are looking for, bring back all the people who help the spy out as the same characters you know and love, throw in a woman you can't tell at first if she is working with the enemy but turns out to double cross the bad guy. And yes I have seen the whole working for the other good guys think plenty of times too. Its nothing new. The car scenes as well were nothing new. You can tell BMW was part of this film, every car made you wish you had it. And yes some of the engine sounds were made up by a voice over of some kind. But if you have the 5.1 surround that comes with the disc you wont complain. And unlike those first bond movies, I can hear bullets whizzing by at 5.1 surround sound. I'm not expert of bullets whizzing around so Ill just except that as a good quality sound. And unlike other action movies. They lose you in the movie. Right to where you get to climax you just fall off. Like a date that just isn't going well anymore. You just want to get dropped off and go home or drop the person off and go home.  To many of these female characters don't play the part. I don't know if its the director telling them stick to their script or what. But they sound so stiff and simply predictable. This woman did not. She sounds sexy, gorgeous and she knows how to handle herself. Exactly how I expect a female agent to act. I think katie holmes was in the 3rd one. I almost passed out from boredom of her character.  I was going to list everything I liked about this movie in this review cause their were a lot but one of my favorite things was that it was set in a foreign place. Not sure how a lot of movies got away from that. It just has a certain feel to it. I enjoy the spy's who have a damn visa or create themselves one even if they are rogue. How the heck are you going to convince me you are trained killer or simply a covert specialist when you can't even get across your own border? And the end of the day this was a great movie. There was some things to take away from the movie. The bad guy didn't bring the film down. But I could have put john travolta in their and got much better results with a lot better lines. The girl was was definitely great. The part where she is in her bikini bottom was wonderful. Reminded you of the old bond movies where you were waiting for that character to show up like that. Its a must watch movie and honestly probably the best action movie I've seen in a while.I really liked "Rogue Nation". Tom Cruise still knows how to get down like them youngsters! Welcome back to the wonderland where impossible things happen nine times out of ten, and human bodies don't break down as they use to in the real world, even if one happens to crash with a superbike! Yes, it's the fifth "Mission: Impossible", aiming for the same throne as "Fast and Furious" and 007 series, among many others.  This is the genre colloquially known as "competence p*rn", which means usually drama or action movies full of skillful and powerful people doing tricky stuff which you should not try at home. And watching them do their thang, all confident and sh*t, is a big part of the viewing pleasure. "M:I" is all about action and big setpieces, starting strong with the airplane-infiltration and never letting us down later either. Quality job all around. As usual, action relies heavily on orchestrated movement, so, don't expect much realism. I would say that "Rogue Nation" doesn't try to be as massive action movie as two of the previous ones, or most of the "Fast and Furious", or 007 with Daniel Craig. But the result works well, everything is in its right place and there's always enough entertainment. The plot and the characters are really thin, to make room for the big set-pieces. So there's not much to remember afterwards to call it a real classic. After all, there are so many epic action movies these days, even fairy-tales go this way now.  But I really liked "Rogue Nation". Tom Cruise still knows how to get down like them youngsters!This is where Cruise belongs Tom Cruise currently has two movie series of which he is the star. There's the 'Mission: Impossible' series and there's the 'Jack Reacher' series. In the 'Jack Reacher' series he's about the only thing holding the whole show back. He's completely unsuited to the role and has destroyed a terrific character created by Lee Child in the books. However, in 'Mission: Impossible' it's quite the opposite. He's perfect for the lead role of 'Ethan Hunt' and plays him excellently. The suave, cocky, arrogant and intelligent character he's perfect for. The tough, large, physical, blunt and hulking one, not so much. 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' is another fine addition to the series. Much like the 'James Bond' series, I find you have to keep your brain switched on the entire movie, otherwise you're likely to become completely lost to the plot and just what exactly they're trying to achieve in each scene. I did find this one was well explained throughout and therefore easier just to sit back and enjoy the action, which is a major plus. I liked the villain enough (nothing to stand-out, but he did the trick) and the support cast did their thing around Cruise adequately. Ultimately though, it was his show and did what he usually does in this series and carried things. There's still plenty of life left in this series I feel.I know I'm supposed to hate this kind of a movie ...and often, I do. But I have to say I've enjoyed the Mission: Impossible films - first, the music and whole setup of the secretary disavowing etc. brings me back to my days watching the series. Secondly, these films are nonstop action with no let up. Third, you can pack your troubles away and just be entertained. What I hate is the fact that this is all Hollywood can do now - these CGI blockbusters with explosions, car chases, bungee jumps and the like - while it's left to independent filmmakers to give us stories with real people, real relationships, and real drama. After a review of the IMF missions, the IMF is disbanded and absorbed into the CIA.  Ethan Hunt goes rogue to stop a shadow syndicate from its path of destruction, and gets help from his old team: Willam Brandt, Benji Dunn, and Luther Stickell (Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames). He has to second-guess everything his nemesis, Solomon Lane, (Sean Harris) will do, asking himself, did he mean me to find this, am I supposed to react this way...in order to beat Lane at his own game.  In the mix is a double agent (Rebecca Ferguson) who, while trying to help Hunt, is answering to the syndicate. This is a perfect type of film for Tom Cruise. I've never thought much of his acting and have always preferred him in an action setting or playing someone like a hit man that requires him to be cold and calculating.  The IMF team was great, with Simon Pegg in the showiest role, and Sean Harris as Lane was one of the most frightening characters with the deadest eyes I've ever seen. Best for me was seeing the Vienna Staatsoper again during a performance of "Turandot" - the scenes there were particularly exciting, the music was beautiful, and it was great to see the opera house again.  This film is very well made, suspenseful, and exciting. Highly recommended.Hopefully There Will Be More Missions To Come! One thing I can say about these "Mission: Impossible" films, there's never a bad one. One or two might not be as good as the others but there's never a bad one, but "Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation", I would say, is the better out of the bunch. As one IMDb user put it, "This is what an action film should be." The fight scenes were fantastic, the chase scenes were flawless, even the part with the cargo jet, if you would consider that a chase scene, and the story-line and plot were good too. I read one review that said, "Seen it all before", which that might be the case a little but it's a "Mission: Impossible" film. They're agents dealing with the bad guys who are trying to take them out. Still this "Mission Impossible" film, so far, is the best and I'm waiting for the next one to come out.Just another great impossible mission. Loved every moment of this movie! Best actors, best plot, and so glad to see Jeremy Renner, and Simon Pegg.. They kept all the great actors for this movie and I am more than happy about it. Pegg is just a great actor, and Renner is one of my favorites! Hope to see him in more movies, including more Mission Impossibles. Never, ever ever kill off Ving Rhames, Jeremy Renners, or Simon Pegg.. obviously don't kill off Tom Cruise!!  I own every Mission Impossible movie, and HOPE to keep buying more! THANK YOU for making yet another badass Mission Impossible... You rock! I rate 10/10 and cannot wait for yet another Imossible Mission!!!An incredibly exciting mission! Part five in the Mission Impossible trilogy is a fast-paced and incredibly exciting mission. Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt of the IMF (Impossible Mission Force), who join forces with hi-tech friend Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and British spy Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) to take down the Syndicate, an International rogue organization - all the while trying to elude the CIA, who wants the IMF disbanded. This is a no-nonsense action thriller from start to finish, providing you with edge-of-your-seat entertainment; Hunt trying to expose those behind the Syndicate while he himself tries to be one step ahead of the CIA is double the suspense!  The stunts were amazing, especially Hunt's impossible mission of switching the computer identity cards in the underwater sequence, and his high-speed motorcycle case. Top kudos on the special effects and stunt teams for their remarkable work on this movie, especially their complete non-reliance on CGI!  The acting was pretty good - Tom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson make a great crime-fighting duo and had great on-screen chemistry. Ving Rhames and Jeremy Renner were decent, and Simon Pegg's was OK. They did most of the humor in the film which, I thought, was a little forced in certain points of the movie. But overall, it's an exciting action thriller that is pure fun and enjoyment!  Grade A-franchise getting better than ever Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) retrieves stolen nerve weapons in a daring operation. CIA director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) gets the IMF disbanded. William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) is forced to work under him. Hunt is captured by Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) and the murky Syndicate organization. Mysterious Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) helps him escape but is also working for the Syndicate. With the help of Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Hunt works to take down Lane and the Syndicate. This is a franchise that is getting better and better. The story works well. It's pretty simple with prerequisite twists. This is basically the new Bond franchise. Everybody works great in this one. Cruise is terrific and Pegg is funny. Renner has settled into the second banana spot. Rhames could be given more to do. Baldwin is a good addition but the best is Rebecca Ferguson. She kicks and acts too. She plays a compelling character and has great chemistry with Cruise. One can't wait for the next one.Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation flawlessly combines action with story! The Mission Impossible franchise is distinct in the fact that it only seems to improve with time. Ghost Protocol was absolutely amazing, but Rogue Nation manages to out perform its predecessor in every way possible. Whether its the over-the-top stunts, perfectly shot action sequences, or intriguing story lines, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation delivers another amazing action movie for 2016 Major props go to director/screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. McQuarrie was able to compose an extremely compelling story, which isn't customary to the Mission Impossible franchise. Interesting characters coupled with a number of plot twists and some tense dialogue help keep the movie fresh from start to finish. If the amazing story wasn't enough to keep viewers attached, then some awesome action sequences should suffice. In what seems to be a trend in 2016, McQuarrie uses practical stunts that lead to some of the most visually-striking action sequences every constructed. Then of course there is Tom Cruise who once again shows us why his is the undisputed King Of Action. His dedication towards the character of Ethan Hunt, as well as his role as a producer and willingness to perform his own stunts are just the icing on the cake!The most satisfying movie I've seen in a long time I probably saw the first film of the franchise back in the day, but then I never paid attention to what came afterwards. Until a couple weeks ago when I watched Ghost Protocol (which was really great!), and just recently I got to see Rogue Nation. My God, it's even better than the previous one! It is a well directed, suspenseful, great looking, action-packed, exciting action movie. I honestly didn't think that big studios are still able to produce such awesomeness, but thank God I was wrong. I know these words might sound over the top, but I am genuinely enthusiastic about this film, because it was so much fun to watch, and I haven't had an experience like it for a long time! Tom Cruise is amazing, just like the rest of the cast. The plot is okay, there are some good twists, there's good humour and really- really good action sequences. It is not a perfect movie (for example, there's a pretty bad cgi car flip, and when I saw that I was like: I hope the rest of the film will not be like that; and thankfully it wasn't), it will not transform your world (at the end of the day it's an action movie), but it was exactly what you want to see when you sit down for a blockbuster action flick: pure excitement and fun!Mark Twain once said that, "A NIGHT AT THE OPERA . . . " " . . . is a good walk spoiled." In this loose remake of director Alfred Hitchcock's THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH II (1956), the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (episode 24 or so) people quadruple the number gun-wielding assassins Hitchcock had prowling around in an opera hall, and switch the program to Puccini's TURANDOT (which was just used for similar dramatic purposes by another action blockbuster a few months back, but I'm not any better than Twain in keeping my opera cameos straight). Tom Cruise also retraces Jimmy Stewart's footsteps to Morocco from TOO MUCH (though since kidnapped children would raise the suspense stakes far too high for today's squeamish movie audiences, only Cruise's comic relief sidekick gets snatched here). Anyone expecting a big musical hit to emerge from MISSION 24, such as Doris Day singing her young son to Freedom with "Que, Sera, Sera," will be sorely disappointed. So too will the folks dying to know what happens in TURANDOT. (SPOILER ALERT: Ping, Pong, and Pang cannot persuade the Mystery Prince to tell Turandot his name, but after Liu's tortured and kills herself, Turandot decides to live happily-ever-after with the Prince, anyway). But for fans of implausible chases, bad guys who cannot shoot the broad side of a palace, and imaginary Higher Tech, MISSION 24 won't disappoint.The quintessential action film Full disclosure: I have never seen any of the previous Mission Impossible films. Not sure how I have avoided it, but it's true. I do vaguely recall the original TV series. This is the quintessential action film. It has chases, explosions, danger, tension, extreme stunts, an evil conspiratorial cabal led by an implacable foe, everything. It is unsullied by much in the way of romance, no shoehorned-in sex scenes with the obligatory female character, which was excellently portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson, a Swedish actress with whom I was unfamiliar. Cruise was Cruise, a successful, if unlikely action hero. Good work by also by Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames. I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.The Mission Impossible Series:Part 5-Rogue Nation. Walking past a local DVD shop,I was shocked to find that they were selling the limited edition 2 disc Blu-Ray of the latest Mission Impossible title at a cheaper price than everyone else is selling the one disc edition for.Since having greatly enjoyed the 4th film in the series,I felt that it was the perfect time to accept the latest mission. The plot: Learning about an international criminal consortium called the Syndicate,IMF agent Ethan Hunt goes to stop the group from selling nerve gas to terrorists.Destroying the nerve gas,Hunt gets caught by surprise,and knocked out.Waking up,Hunt finds himself being tortured by members of the Syndicate,which includes a rogue British agent called Ilsa Faust.Working undercover,Faust knocks out her fellow gang members and helps Hunt to escape. 6 Months later:  With there being no sign of Hunt for months,CIA head Alan Hunley gets the IMF shut down over the "destructive" methods which it has solved cases with.Remaining undercover,Hunt gets fellow (former) agent Benjam√≠n "Benji" Dunn to attend an opera which the Austrian Chancellor. Arriving at the opera,Hunt and Dunn begin to fear that they are about to see a symphony composed by the Syndicate. View on the film: Reuniting with Cruise after Jack Reacher,co-writer/(along with Drew Pearce) director Christopher McQuarrie &amp; cinematographer Robert Elswit give the globe-trotting locations a stylish elegance,as an assassination attempt at an opera house is lit in icy blue,and a breakneck motorbike chase grinds dusty yellows into the screen.Keeping up with the gripping stunts being (largely) performed by the cast, McQuarrie releases crisp tracking shots,which along with giving the title an urgent atmosphere,also allows the viewer to clearly see every punch and dive delivered. Standing out from the other films in the series,the screenplay by McQuarrie &amp; Pearce make this the first Mission movie to have a strong connection to the previous films,with the writers transferring The Syndicate group from the TV series (where they were the main baddies) to the film universe.Whilst the action gets off to a flying start with a dazzling sequence filmed on the outside of a plane, (which was filmed in real time!)the writers keep the action entwined with the plot,with the Syndicate's activities pushing Hunt and his fellow spies to take drastic measures. Dipping into the espionage origins of Mission Impossible,the writers surprisingly allow the Syndicate to strike some heavy blows,as Hunt (played by a terrific Tom Cruise) meets his match in the icy,femme fatale Ilsa Faust, (played by the alluringly whip-smart Rebecca Ferguson) who gives Hunt his own mission impossible.Don't just leave a guy hanging'. Tom Cruise is back again for the fifth time as undercover agent Ethan Hunt of the Impossible Mission Force. Intense and full of action as Hunt pushes himself to his mental and physical capabilities. This, I think, is the best of the franchise. The CIA, led by an animate chief Hunley (Alec Baldwin), is wanting the IMF to be permanently shutdown. Ethan believes with all his worth that he can bring down the mysterious Syndicate raging to seize global control. Hunt will go rogue in his self-assigned ridiculously dangerous mission to prove the IMF is still needed. Hunt enlists teammates Benji(Simon Pegg), Luther (Ving Rhames) and special agent Brandt (Jeremy Renner) in a world-trotting undercover chore...that doesn't actually stays undercover. One of the best parts of the film is when Hunt gets the aid of a fetching British double-agent Ilsa Faust(Rebecca Ferguson). Rounding out the cast: Jens Hulten, Sean Harris, Simon McBurney and Tom Hollander.5th film. -Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Rogue Nation is a 2015 American action spy film co-written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. It is the fifth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. The film stars Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris, and Alec Baldwin with Cruise, Renner, Pegg, and Rhames reprising their roles from previous films. Rogue Nation is produced by Cruise, J. J. Abrams, and David Ellison of Skydance Productions. In the film, IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is on the run from the CIA, following the IMF's disbandment as he tries to prove the existence of the Syndicate, an international mysterious terrorist consortium. --Critical response: -On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Rogue Nation has a rating of 93% positive reviews, based on 261 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Rogue Nation continues the franchise's thrilling resurgence ‚Äî and proves that Tom Cruise remains an action star without equal." Metacritic gives the film a rating of 75 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a grade of "A-" on an A+ to F scale. --Sequel: -By May 2015, Paramount was developing a sixth Mission: Impossible film, with Cruise, Abrams, Ellison, and Goldberg returning to produce, along with Don Granger and Matt Grimm executive producing, and Elizabeth Raposo overseeing development. Shortly before the release of Rogue Nation, Cruise announced he would return for a sixth film, asserting that it could begin production in 2016. Following Cruise's statement, Paramount also confirmed that a sixth film was in development. By December 2015, McQuarrie announced that he will be returning to direct the sixth film and Ferguson will be reprising her role as Ilsa Faust as well.The 'Mission: Impossible' franchise is aging like wine Maybe it wasn't impossible, but in 2011 it seemed highly likely that the aging Tom Cruise and the "Mission: Impossible" series could keep going after three films spanning 10 years (and all earning merely "decent" marks). Then "Ghost Protocol" hit theaters and made doubters bite their tongues. That being the case, "Rogue Nation" keeps those teeth firmly clamped down. Despite losing the "Ghost Protocol" screenwriters as well as director Brad Bird, "Rogue Nation" doesn't slip under the watch of Oscar winner Christopher McQuarrie ("The Usual Suspects") who directed Cruise in 2012's franchise-starting action thriller "Jack Reacher" and wrote his 2014 star vehicle "Edge of Tomorrow." Needless to say, their marriage is working. McQuarrie's screenplay elevates the thriller and espionage elements of the franchise. The weakest aspect of "Ghost Protocol" was its plot, but "Rogue Nation" keeps the mystery tight and its terrorism-focused conflict is less outrageous than some past "M:I" evil schemes.  In the fifth installment, the IMF finds itself disbanded by an angry CIA honcho (Alec Baldwin) just as Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has uncovered the existence of the Syndicate, a global network of disavowed, missing and presumed dead secret service agents conducting widespread terrorism. Resourceless and with the CIA breathing down their necks, Hunt must secretly coordinate with Benji (Simon Pegg), Luther (Ving Rhames) and Brandt (Jeremy Renner) to find the man behind the Syndicate and stop them. Along the way, Hunt comes across a former British Intelligence agent in deep cover with the Syndicate named Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who is in every way his equal yet whose allegiances make their relationship complicated. Ferguson explodes into Hollywood in this role as a young but mature-looking field agent with acrobatic takedown moves like Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow from the Marvel film universe. Ferguson really shares the spotlight with Cruise instead of playing his arm candy. Whereas "Ghost Protocol" was more about suspense and innovative action (the Burj Khalifa sequence is still among the best of the decade), but "Rogue Nation" takes a more visceral approach. Aside from the "James Bond"-like opening sequence that sees Cruise holding on to an airplane door as it takes off, the stunt work isn't larger- than-life so much as tight, gritty and explosive. Actually, "Rogue Nation" shares a lot of DNA with the modern "Bond" films in terms of action and globe-trotting. Robert Elswit's cinematography in this film and "Ghost Protocol" have really helped the franchise up the visual ante in a way that has dramatically increased its esteem. There are still lots of formulaic tendencies and things that keep the franchise light, but it's more fun than it's ever been. So after 10 years of languishing, the "Mission: Impossible" franchise has earned its way into the echelon of the best active action film franchises, and it better hurry before its 53-year-old action star decides to "take it easy for awhile." ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for moreAnother Mission Accomplished - Rogue Nation Rules I loved MI Rogue Nation. This franchise keeps delivering what the audience wants - Tom Cruise, an unbeatable bad guy, beautiful smart tough women, controversy, car/plane/bike chases, and an impossible mission.  The usual cast of supporting characters are back to support Ethan Hunt who is somewhere in the world doing something to save us. The plane chase scene at the start is like the fuse lit at the beginning of all MI movies. You know then that you are in for action.  The bad guy is this mysterious Syndicate leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). He is the cool bad guy who never seems to get riled, is always one step or more ahead, and has every detail planned with vicious cold- heartedness - the picture of the modern day terrorist. The beautiful spy is Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). She was pretty good, making you wonder throughout which side she really belongs to. Then there is the intrigue about the whole Syndicate - who is the leader? why are they doing these things? The story works really well I think. Can the MI team come back even though they are now (again?) unsanctioned? How can they stop a gang of ex-agents, bad guys, and all around terrible folks? How can they catch up to a guy who is always one step ahead? It's an impossible mission. Tom Cruise delivers another great performance, but you can only wonder how many more of these he has in him - at 53, he's getting a bit old for the physicality these roles require. But hey, what with the Expendables, and the Taken series, and Kevin Costner rejuvenating himself as a spy, you never know.  If you like action movies, go see MI-Rogue Nation. Enjoy.Now that's a movie! I for one am a fan of MI movies so I may be biased. But this was a non stop action thrill ride, filled with great action sequences, plausible story lines and comedy to boot! This movie gets right to it the first scene we are right in the action. What I love about this movie is that, even though it's complicated, it makes sense. The way it unfolds is excellent, and you can follow it. This action movie does not make the mistakes of others. It has no pointless scenes, it does not have impossible tech, does not take itself too seriously and is not sexist as fu(&amp;. I really really really enjoyed that the woman who helped Ethan out was not treated like a physical object and simply 'the love interest'. You know simply a toy for our hero to play with....no. She was an actual human being! Amazing! Sure she is attractive but so is the rest of the cast. I really liked how she was treated equally, very refreshing considering how sexist most movies tend to be. The movie keeps you guessing, NOT confused. There is a BIG difference there. So if you wanna see top of the line special effects and have a whole lot of fun this is the film for you! I highly recommend it! They keep the film current with some nods to the past films. It's just perfect. I like how the movie does not lose itself in the bs trends most movies do. This one will be a classic that you could enjoy for many years to come.I thoroughly enjoyed this epic action movie! 8/10 Review: I really enjoyed this movie! It's full of drama right from the get go and the action scenes are really impressive. I also liked the fact that they all pulled together for this mission and that it wasn't just Tom Cruise being a one man army. Anyway, after there many successful missions, which saved many life's, the IMF are under investigation because of there underarm tactics and the money that they have cost the US government, so Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) shuts down the elite squad which means that they have to tackle crime without there backing. When the IMF come under attack by the syndicate, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) gathers his team to take down the ruthless Lane (Sean Harris) who has killed many innocent people, without remorse. After being saved by IIsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who is working for Lane, he digs into her past, only to find out that she is also an agent, working undercover and they soon join forces to stop Lane from getting an priceless disk which contains information about the syndicate. Whilst battling against Lane's henchmen, Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), help Ethan to protect the disk and to stop Lane from killing more innocent people, while William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) tackles the political side of there operation. After saving many life's and finally taking down Lane and the syndicate, the US government decide to carry on backing the IMF, now that Alan Hunley has seen, first hand, what they are capable of. This fast paced movie has a very detailed storyline with some amazing stunts, especially the outrageous stunt on the plane at the beginning and it was good to see everyone finally pull there weight in the organisation. Alec Baldwin will definitely make a great addition to the team, which means that we might actually see more of Jeremy Renner in the field alongside Tom Cruise. Anyway, like many of the other Mission Impossible movies, Cruise really does give this movie his all and the many twists in the storyline made this a joy to watch. All of the different members of the IMF, bring something unique to the team and the chemistry between each member is felt on screen, especially between Pegg &amp; Cruise. Basically, I really enjoyed it and I can't wait to see another movie from this franchise. Great Watch! Round-Up: Tom Cruise is still doing these death defying stunts at 53 years old and with Top Gun 2 in development alongside Jack Reacher 2 and Mission Impossible 6, he really isn't showing any signs of slowing down. As he produced Rogue Nation, alongside J.J. Abrams, he had a lot of input when it came to the action scenes and the storyline, so he really did put a lot of effort into bringing something original to audiences. I wasn't a big fan of Jack Reacher, Oblivion, Knight &amp; Day and Rock of Ages but I did enjoy Edge Of Tomorrow and the funny Tropic Thunder, were he played a role which is completely out of his comfort zone but it earned him an Golden Globe nomination. For 2015, Rogue Nation came in 11th place in box office earning, which isn't bad because a lot of big movies came out this year. It really is what it says on the tin so if your into your action films with a "goodie vs. baddie" concept, then you will definitely enjoy this movie. Budget: $150million Worldwide Gross: $682.3million I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/thrillers starring Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin, Sean Harris and Simon McBurney. 8/10Of Thinly Disguised Identities. These fracnhises have replaced the weejkkly adventure series on televvision. It doesn't matter who the stars are or what the plot is. Everything and everyone are replaceable. Okay, Connery and Stallone are out, but Damon and Cruise are now in. No more SMERSH but then we have "The Syndicate." If there are any consistent themes, they are advanced technology and the superior combat skills of the protagonist.  Well, I suppose there are other iterated shots at a more molecular level -- an armed man is fighting an unarmed man and there is a shot of the weapon skidding across the floor; one combatant slams his forehead against that of the other and disables him, and to hell with Newton; a shoe stomps on the accelerator cut to a tire burning rubber and raising a cloud of dust. This film as at least one example of each clich√©. It's just added evidence that the fall of civilization is at hand. Here's another I'll throw in for the cognocenti among us. An assassination attempt -- mostly out of Hitchcock's "The Man Who Knew Too Much" -- takes place during an opera. It's "Madam Butterfly." Now guess which aria you're going to hear. At least no one will sleep during the bullets and acrobatics.  The villainous organization here has no particular plan in mind. It's not an underground nest of rich Nazis or rabid drug dealers. It's only purpose, we're told, is to "destroy the system that created it." Right.  You can watch it if you like. Personally, these sequels drain me of energy in the way that Hollywood has been drained of imagination.Another fun M:I movie I'm really glad the franchise is still going. This was yet another action-packed movie from the series. There are some fantastic, creative scenes shot inside the Vienna Opera House, and an awesome underwater scene later on in the movie. Great to see some returning cast members as well.THANKS TOM! This is one of the best 'thrillers' of all time in the true sense of the word, and the best written story in the series. Thanks Tom and company for showing that teamwork can work wonders!The 5th Installment in the Series is a Must See!!! Ethan and team take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF. With the beautiful addition of the talented Mrs. Rebecca Ferguson and the menacing Mr. Sean Harris Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is a thrilling, fast paced and incredible New Installment in the MI Series and one that needs to be seen. Plus that Opening Airplane Scene is Freaking Incredible!!!! (A+)Time for a Rethnk? "Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation" is the fifth instalment in the long-running "Mission: Impossible" series. It shows the obvious influence of the even-longer-running Bond series. All the films in these two franchises involve Our Hero, named either James Bond or Ethan Hunt, travelling around the world with a glamorous female sidekick to various exotic foreign locations, performing various feats of improbable (not to say impossible) derring-do in an attempt to thwart the evil schemes of some dastardly individual or organisation.  "Rogue Nation" fits this template more or less exactly. Hunt, accompanied by his glamorous female sidekick Ilsa Faust, travels to Minsk, Vienna, Havana, Morocco and London, performing various feats of derring-do along the way, in an attempt to thwart the evil schemes of the Syndicate, a mysterious terrorist group. Those schemes include the assassination of various world leaders, including the Austrian Chancellor and the British Prime Minister. As the "Mission Impossible" franchise is an American one, London counts as an exotic foreign location in a way in which it does not in the Bond series.  In some respects "Rogue Nation" parallels recent developments in the Bond cycle. In early Bonds it was generally easy to tell who was on what side- Bond, his MI6 colleagues and the lovely Bond Girl were all on the side of right and justice whereas the villains (Dr No, Blofeld, Goldfinger, etc.) and their henchmen were first into bat for Satan's kingdom. Occasionally, as with Pussy Galore in "Goldfinger", the Bond Girl started off working for the baddies, but inevitably changed sides (aided by Bond's powers of seduction) when she realised just what a bastard her employer really was.  In more recent episodes, however, Bond has had to cope with inter-service rivalry between MI5 and MI6, former British agents going over to the dark side and colleagues who prove untrustworthy. So it proves in "Rogue Nation". Hunt has to do battle not only against the Syndicate but also against the CIA, who want to shut down the IMF whose agents are regarded as unreliable. (In this context "IMF" stands not for "International Monetary Fund" but "Impossible Mission Force"). The head of the Syndicate, Solomon Lane, turns out to be a rogue British agent (just like the characters played by Sean Bean in "Goldeneye" and Javier Bardem in "Skyfall"). And Hunt never knows whom he can trust- not even the lovely Ilsa and his friend colleague Benji Dunn. (Ilsa, despite her German-sounding name, is also an MI6 agent).  One difference between the "Mission: Impossible" series and the Bonds is that, although the series has been going for over twenty years, the main character has been played by the same actor throughout. Tom Cruise was 53 when "Rogue Nation" was made and I understand that he will return in a sixth instalment later this year, making him, at 56, older than either Sean Connery or Roger Moore when they made their final Bonds. In 2015, however, Cruise still looked youthful enough to be plausible as the hero of an action thriller, and I doubt if the intervening three years will have made much difference in this respect when "Mission: Impossible" emerges. Rebecca Ferguson makes a lovely heroine and there is a good cameo from Alec Baldwin as the CIA boss, although Sean Harris as Lane never seems very threatening, more like a provincial bank manager than a rogue spy or international terrorist. As a thriller, in fact, "Rogue Nation" is quite a decent one with some good special effects and well-handled action scenes. It does, however, have two problems, which it shares with a number of recent spy films involving betrayal or double-dealing. The first is that the plot at times becomes so complex it can be difficult to understand. The second is that plots of this nature are starting to become over-familiar; increasing complexity seems to increase, rather than decrease, the feeling of "seen-it-all=before". Perhaps it is time for a rethink of the modern spy genre. 6/10 A goof. The Austrian Chancellor is referred to as a "European head of state". In fact, the Austrian Chancellor, like the British Prime Minister, is Head of Government but not Head of State. The Head of Sate of Austria is the President.Cruise and McQuarrie make a good team. *no spoilers* Let me start with Jack Reacher, that film was good but didn't live up to the book. However McQuarrie made Cruise work in the role by adding a new flavour to his own kinda take on the 'Reacher' books, this is what he has done again with this film. He made this Mission Impossible feel different. It was not only a new kind of take on the previous films, it also felt just as isolated as Ghost Protocol, which in my opinion is a smart move with these films - much like what the Bond films do. It returns to the original things you loved about the original films, but extracts all the cheesy campy 'Cruise-liners' and actually gives the character more of Ethan Hunt an emotional state with more realistic intentions and motives. Almost like someone you can relate to, or wish to be. Cruise once again plays the character more extremely and heightens his predeceasing film by far. This film drags at times within story wise, but the expert on screen chemistry between Pegg and Cruise keeps you distracted, as well as the amazing action and car chase scenes. Overall I would go watch this in cinema to experience the full scale of how big and noisy the action is, and it would be worth pre-ordering on Blu-Ray DVD too.An Absolute Blast! Mind Blowing Stunts and Gadgets! A roller coaster of non-stop excitement! Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) faces a new threat called the Syndicate, a network dedicated to establish a new world order via terrorist attacks. Ethan has another problem - his agency, IMF, is shut down. Now, his team consists of rogue agents with the most impossible mission yet. I'm just going to be frank, this is my first Mission Impossible film and Rogue Nation makes me want to see more. As a movie lover, I get excited when I'm introduced to new film franchises and boy was this an introduction. Having no history with the franchise, it did not damage my extreme enjoyment.  The film itself is an absolute blast. When the credits rolled, I felt as if I'd just come off an amusement park ride. This film has incredible car chases, mind blowing stunts and gadgets that even James Bond would beg for. Every scene is better than the last. Action is not the only thing that fuels this movie. It also has tremendous actors. Some of the feats pulled in this film are absurd and stretch your belief system. Performers like Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg successfully help you buy into these impossible situations. Even the characters they play are aware of the insanity but they treat it like an everyday occurrence because it's their job. Like magicians, there is a charm and elegance from the performer, so you don't catch the strings and mirrors.  Even if you haven't seen other Mission Impossible films, I bet you recognize the iconic music. Many films and TV Shows have satirized it and who can blame them? The theme is grand! Many composers have added their own touch to it like Danny Elfman and even Hans Zimmer. This film's track is composed by Joe Kraemer and is one of the best versions, if not the best. The music starts out with two notes and then grows. As the music got louder, my pulse rose until the title came up and the Mission Impossible theme burst through the speakers. The music really gets you into the mood.  My favorite character is Benji (Simon Pegg). I love the characters that have the gadgets and technology to help our hero. Benji is not only a loyal friend to Ethan, but their history makes the interactions between them funnier and sincere.  My favorite scene is when Cruise is under water switching the security codes. When you hear about actors doing their own stunts, one man comes to mind - Tom Cruise. Cruise is known for his authenticity with stunts. (That's really him hanging on to the outside of the plane - with safety precautions of course) You'd think he's at his limit. Well, according to the director (Christopher McQuarrie), in this scene Cruise held his breath for six minutes. I looked it up! Even McQuarrie thought it was, "too real." While you're watching the scene, you're holding your breath as well.  The moral of the story is, "Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer." Ethan has teamed up with Lisa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), an agent who may or may not be part of the Syndicate. Ethan is unsure if he can trust her, but he knows if he stays with her, the closer he is to stopping the Syndicate. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to ages 10 through 18. There is, of course, violence and language but nothing you wouldn't expect in a PG-13 film. Your mission is to see Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. It is in theaters July 31. Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst dot org.Good Movie! Ethan Hunt did it again! Overall it's a good movie, full with a twisted plot as well as the action that Tom's tradition to do the real stunt by himself. This time is quite insane as he hanging outside a flying airplane! However, I have several "complaints" such as Ethan could use carbon fiber diving equipment to make the job easier hehehe :P And one more "complaint" that I have: Alibaba Picture has invested to this movie, but why not involved Jack Ma to be the villain?! I am sure it would be more interesting isn't it? XD In summary it is worth to watch! :)No Signs That the Series is Slowing Down Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015)  *** 1/2 (out of 4)  Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his group must try and locate the Syndacate and prove that they are real as well as stop their latest mission. I'm not going to spoil too much of the plot to MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION because it's really best that you go into the film with as little knowledge of the plot as possible. Yes, you heard me correct. Even though this is a summer action movie full of spectacular stunts, it also features a plot and a very good one at that. The film starts off with a terrific stunt with Cruise hanging from an airplane and after seeing this you can't help but wonder how the rest of the film is going to top it. It starts off a bit slow after this as we get a subplot dealing with the CIA but the final hour of this movie is one terrific experience after another. There are several reasons this film works so well but we can start off with the obvious, which are the terrific stunts. Most people have seen portions of the airplane during the television spots and the trailers and this here is certainly eye-opening but there's so much terrific stuff that follows. There's a breath-taking sequence that takes place in the water that will have you holding your breathe. There's a terrific bait-and-switch inside a political powerhouse. There's the fantastic chase on motorcycles through winding streets. There's also a beautifully orchestrated sequence inside an opera house, which certainly seems like a wink to Hitchcock and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. Another thing that makes this series stand apart from so many others is the fact that we do get actual stories. Again, I'm not going to ruin all the twists and turns here but you're constantly caught up in it and wondering where the next mystery is going to come from. Then there are the performances with Cruise once again shining in the title role. I still remember watching the first film in the theater and it's hard to believe that all these years later Cruise is still going strong. Jeremy Renner, Alec Baldwin, Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg are all in fine form and Rebecca Ferguson is terrific in her part. MISSION: IMPOSSIBE - ROGUE NATION pretty much packs everything into one film and in the end it's certainly one of the best of the summer and proves that the series shows no signs of slowing down.One must see mission Found the first three films ones that had a lot to like (namely the action, the visuals, good casting on the whole and Philip Seymour Hoffmann's superb villain in the third) but also their faults (plot convolution in the first and third and the characters could have been written better in the second and third). 'Ghost Protocool' to me was a great film and the best of the series since the original, and actually better than it, mainly because the story even though somewhat familiar seemed more focused and far less convoluted. The latest instalment 'Rogue Nation' is on 'Ghost Protocool's' very high level. Sure, there is a little bit of familiarity and the basic structure is somewhat formulaic, but 'Rogue Nation' has enough freshness and so much fast and furious excitement and thrills it doesn't feel like an issue. Visually, 'Rogue Nation' is even slicker and even more stylish than 'Ghost Protocool', perhaps the most audacious of all five films put together. The locations, from sinister drabness to stunningly colourful, are a feast for the eye and the effect dazzle. The music doesn't overbear the action and such at all while making a pulsating impact thanks to the thrillingly authentic sound. With the exception of a few choppy combat scenes, big emphasis on the few, the action is bigger, bolder and more dynamic than any other action scenes seen before in the previous four instalments. Many are breath-taking in their excitement and also nuances. Christopher McQuarrie's directing is some of the best he's ever done, with a great sense of visual style and a real grasp of the storytelling. 'Rogue Nation's' script is sharp, knowingly sophisticated with the humour (not cheesy or out of place) and intrigue superbly balanced. The story is told at a breakneck pace without being rushed and grips one right in and never lets go. There is an appealing light-heartedness, tongue-in-cheek and suspense of superior tension and elegance (as far as the 'Mission Impossible' films go) worthy of Alfred Hitchcock, a big claim and to some hyperbolic but it felt that way to me and it is grand praise indeed. Tom Cruise is very impressive, handling the stunts with effortless and enviable ease and acting with steely charisma. Rebecca Ferguson shows a knack for scene-stealing, with her in ersatz breath-of-fresh-air form. Sean Harris is an intimidatingly menacing villain, one of the best written villains of the series, while Simon Pegg's comic relief in no way jars and is actually very funny and Jeremy Renner's presence is more than welcome. It is a shame however that Ving Rhames, though charismatic, is underused. Overall, a sheer delight and one mission that is a must see. 9/10 Bethany CoxNot bad, but a big step down in quality from the last two ROGUE NATION is the latest MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE and by my count the fifth in the series. Sadly I was hoping it would be as good as the previous instalment in the franchise, GHOST PROTOCOL, and it doesn't come anywhere close to that film's quality; too much of it is filled with unrealistic scenes and humour which really starts to grate after a while. The film has much in common with SPECTRE in that it sees Tom Cruise and his team going after a mysterious organisation set on controlling the world, although the organisation here seems to consist of one guy, master villain Sean Harris, who is incidentally on autopilot throughout. We get the usual template film, featuring massive action chase spectacle sequences, a heist or two, plot twists and betrayals, and lots of sparky dialogue between the lead characters. Superficially the film is entertaining; a movie with tons of action like this would be hard pressed not to entertain. The motorbike chase in Morocco is a highlight, and the early plane stunt is great fun, especially as it was filmed close to home. But the script is below par and makes odd choices, like making Simon Pegg a secondary lead when he's not been around much previously other than playing the token geek. Cruise goes through the motions with aplomb, but Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames have so little to do that you wonder why they bothered showing up. Worst of all is Rebecca Ferguson as one of those irritatingly perfect action women who comes out on top time and time again; she has one stock expression on her face from beginning to end and really got up my nose. ROGUE NATION comes third in my list of favourite MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE films, better than the first two but behind the fourth and third ones.Good flick but disbelief creeps in with the motorcycle chase I've written and sold screenplays, love movies and am very easy to please. I quite enjoyed the new MI film. I can also suspend my disbelief with the best of them. But please ¬Ö I love a good chase scene but they are just too unrealistic. I have owned two of the BMW S1000RR motorcycles featured in the film and there is no way any car is going to keep up with a modern sport bike for even a moment. Come on screenwriters, come up with something new. Make me and Steve McQueen believers again. The film worked well, was well paced and Elsa stole the show. Last quip, at the end, they need our hero alive, and then start shooting at him? Another instance where the writers just ante up a clich√©d shoot-out chase that gets a bit boring if it doesn't support the story.This Was So Much FUN! Well played Alec Baldwin! I had no idea what your mission impossible was until the middle of the movie *LOL*  I haven't had this much fun in 2 hours, in such a LONG time. No matter how predictable the ending - Tom Cruise is always such a delight to watch - what an exhilarating ride. As always it would not be Mission Impossible without the legendary Mission Impossible musical score and now 3-D printed masks. They even threw in a few extra heart-stopping, pulse racing stunt action. The motorcycle chase was even better than the Mini Cooper thrill ride of The Italian Job.  Simon Pegg &amp; Ving Rhames are truly Cruise's Yin n Yang. Rebecca Ferguson was not too shabby as the Red-Headed Assassin/Femme Fatale :*)Mission Impossible ; Watch It , Great action and Spy vs. Spy I've watched all mission impossible movies, and this latest is really WELL DONE. It is very nice and a spy vs. spy story. Nice Locations in London, and Morocco. Actions was fast and thrilling. The sexy actress was really sexy and has good acting and fight skills. I really wanted Ethan hunt to kiss her.. hehehe. I hope director make them Love each other, a least even a Fling. Many new gadgets doing awesome things ,.. script of Ethan Hunt vs. Enemy spy leader was good. Guys, watch this movie and enjoy :). This movie is a Success. Awaiting for Mission Impossible 6.What Going to the Movies Should Be!! After a summer of sci-fi, super heroes, and animation, we were looking forward to Mission Impossible, hoping it would not disappoint. Wow! What a movie it was. Our audience sat spellbound throughout, and applauded at the end. The story line, while complex and containing lots of surprises, was still one that one could follow. The action scenes were spectacular. The car chase was like nothing you have seen, and the motorcycle chase was even more amazing. The locales, from London to Vienna to Casablanca and elsewhere, were very well done. And the acting! Tom was as good as he's ever been. His fellow MI friends, Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames, and especially Simon Pegg, were great. The female lead, Rebecca Ferguson, kept one guessing throughout if she was bad or good. And the bad guys, were they ever bad! The audience left the theater smiling and talking about how much fun it was watching this movie. We wish all movies made us feel this way!By far the best MI Movie to date... Seen it at an IMAX. Great story, great acting, great action. It really was an incredible experience. Movies like this put my faith back into great cinema experiences. I am not going to mention any specifics as you have to see it to believe it. Must watch at the cinema if you can. Best movie this year, by far. There was not a single moment throughout the movie where you can take your eyes off the screen. One final note for those who reviewed it lower than 6 ( especially those 3's and 4's), you guys want to really stop your illegal cam downloads and watch these movies as they were intended to be watched. Being a massive fan of these films, this is the best one yet.The Best Movie of the series and of 2015 (so far) If I'm completely honest there has been a lot of movies in 2015 have been really disappointing but this movie is one of the few that not only met expectations but surpassed them. I have liked every movie in this series (yes even 2) and it's not easy to become the best of a franchise this good but this did it. All of the stunts were amazing starting with the hanging on the side of the cargo plane which was the opening scene of the movie and wasn't even the best scene in the movie. The action was great all the fist fights and the car and motorcycle chases were all so well done and ended up being some of the best I have seen in a long time. All the main characters in the movie had amazing chemistry even from characters that had never previously met like Luther and Brandt and Brandt and The head on the CIA. Rebecca Ferguson was amazing in this movie and her character was unpredictable and very mysterious. The film was also very funny at times mostly from Benji and generally every character making fun of Alec Baldwins character. The villains were very solid the syndicate as a faceless organization were threatening enough as it was but Sean Harris as Soloman Lane was a really solid villain and really felt last me Ethan Hunt has met his match. This film was in one word Amazing and met all of my expectations and I really hope more movies come in the series after this and if they can be equally as amazing as this one.The best Mission Impossible The multinational plot involving the "IMF" vs "the Syndicate" is surprisingly clear and you can follow it without too much effort. The excellent direction lets you see everything you want to see without wasted scenes. The action is original fun and exciting from the Vienna Opera House to the underwater sequence to the motorcycle chase through Morocco. Incorporates everything you want to see from MI involving getting out of impossible situations. Music is effective using the main theme and Puccini. The cast may not seem very glamorous at first sight. The mainly British supporting cast are pretty droll. Strong and masterful breakout role for the "White Queen's" Rebecca Ferguson as an enigmatic British agent. She holds her own action wise in fight scenes and subterfuge. She has an intelligent look that recalls Ingrid Bergman. Tom Cruise in his 50s can still make the action convincing and exciting. Look how out of shape his contemporaries from Top Gun have become compared to him. Best action movie this year.Your mission, If you choose to accept it, Is to watch this movie It looks like Tom has been Cruising with another great movie, as Mission Impossible-Rogue Nation is filled with the right amount of action scenes and comic relief to make this a must see. It hooks you in with an exciting start, which in turn is a pleasant way to a vague idea of what the plot line is. After that, it steps right into what we have all wanted to see... the shot mainly focusing in on Ethan Hunt doing his thing, him working efficiently on the fringe of destruction of the world.\ How is this movie different from the others out there?  First off, Ethan Hunt is a reasonable man in his own respect - as in not blowing anybody's head off. He realizes that thinking through the situation is better than going Rambo on the front lines. Brain over Brawn. While a good thoughtless killing may be good in very certain circumstances, this movie is not meant to be on of them. It shows the genius of Tom Cruise's character and how he thinks. He shows he does the job for the reason of saving the world, not for the girls (Thanks, Bond).  Also, the balance of this movie from conflict to humor/diving into the story-line is impeccable. I feel I have to bring up San Andreas as a comparison. While a good movie, it involved the destruction of objects most of the time. This is not the case in Mission Impossible-Rogue Nation. When the action starts to have the potential of becoming overwhelming, a good joke pops up and makes you chuckle. Or when you might start to crave a shootout, one happens.  Overall, Mission Impossible keeps your eyes glued to the screen the whole time and you should spend the time to watch it and makes you want to know when Ethan gets to Hunt down his next enemy. And yes, the only thing that you are disappointed about when the credits start rolling, is that the movie ended.Perfect summer block buster Mission Impossible Rouge Nation is maybe the best MI movie so far. It is a perfect summer block buster movie. It feels retro at the same time it looks very modern action flick. It feels little like old time Roger Moore Bond movies. Simon Pegg is perfect contrast to Tom Cruises Ethan Hunt character and their chemistry combines very satisfy way to a perfect action movie. Beautiful scenery around the world together with Puccini's dramatic Turandot theme makes it perfect entertainment. Release date same year with the new Bond movie, six months earlier is perfect time to release this film. Timing works perfectly combining great action scenes with storytelling. Movie is enjoyable way retro and same time it feels very fresh. It is a perfect summer action rumble. Tom Cruise practice all his stunts by himself and that make the movie feel as realistic as it is possible to feel. After a movie you will leave movie theatre so satisfy that you almost can't wait the next movie. It leaves to you same feeling that old Bond movies did, you can't wait to see the next movie to see how they will surprise your expectations. This is what Hollywood's dream factory is as it's best. Shameless entertainment made with big heart to audience regardless critics. Just perfect movie entertainment.Edge of the seat action from start to finish! It took me ages to write this review because there are no words for how amazing this movie is. It is action packed from start to finish, has laugh out loud moments and makes you pray for a 6th instalment.  The thrill ride starts from the opening credits and the famous theme song begins, even that was enough to get me pumped up and ready for the movie. So let's recap, why is it so amazing? Tom Cruise is hanging off a plane for crying out loud!!!! Simon Pegg is HILARIOUS and gets a bigger chunk of the action this time too and newcomer Rebecca Ferguson is nothing short of BA. If you're considering seeing this film, just do it! It's a thrill ride and keeps you wondering, what will happen next?For The Love of God Literally the worst movie i have ever seen. I could not bare to watch one more moment of this film. The dialogue was terrible, the acting was terrible, pretty much everything was terrible except for the hot chick in it. I would not advise anyone to see such a movie. Please save your money and buy some food or some crap. That would be way more enjoyable. I have never left a review for a movie before this but this one deserved my opinion. I literally had to walk out of the theater because I couldn't take it anymore.  Not only did the movie contain the most obvious and constantly overused movie tropes, but it assumes it's audience is literally brain-dead. Furthermore, the CGI actions scenes were worse than the quality seen in Jurassic World, except the CGI in the original Jurassic Park was somehow better than the two combined. 75% of the 150 Million dollar budget was probably used to coax Simon Pegg and Alec Baldwin to star in such a train-wreck, I mean seriously, Pegg was in Hot-fuzz and Shaun of The Dead. SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Simon Peggs career is just as over as Alec Baldwins, matter of fact, the next thing you're probably going to see Simon Pegg in is a Travelocity commercial. Also, I want to discuss Tom Cruise. Scientology probably had a hand in this piece of garbage, there's no way they didn't. They must be all up in Hollywood pulling strings because otherwise this piece of filth would never have made it to theaters for people to be tortured by. Tom Cruise has never, in his entire career made a good film. Top Gun might be the only debatable film because of the Kenny Loggins song. Please, please, please, for the love of God, if you respect yourself or those that you love, DO NOT take them to this film. Tom is lucky the Geneva Conventions hasn't learned of this films existence otherwise he would be on trial for war crimes against the greater good. I put this film on the same level as, that feeling you get when you eat too much spicy Mexican food. You know you messed up really bad, and now you can do nothing but sit and cry about the terrible mistakes you have made and just pray for it to be over. I have never been much of a praying man, but at this point I would like to say one thing to whatever God may, or may not be up there: I don't ask you for much, but please for the love of Christ, make this movie go away, arguably before world hunger because it is truly that bad.Jeremy Renner ruined a classic Jeremy Renner has no business forcing his way into this series and other franchises. He is a horrible actor and needs establish his own presence before ruining others. I could only bear the first hour of this movie before turning it off. I loved the action scenes with Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, and Rebecca Ferguson. They were exciting and gave the established franchise a forward progression in action. There seemed to be forced story with shitty Jeremy Renner's character that made me puke internally. I will never watch another movie with him.Predictable events ! I enjoyed Tom. But the movie is awful. Worst sequel so far. I'm a fan of MI sequels, so had great expectations. MI is a promise for tech action lovers. Except Mission impossible - 3, they always raise the bar to impossible levels. This one had actions that cannot be levelled even with a TV series. Then I measured it for drama, but all events are predictable to the end. In case of acting I'll give Jeremy Renner one point over Tom, to be honest. And one question still cranking in my head, the CIA is so dumb or the writers made them as dumb as a stick for us to enjoy. Disappointment is not the exact verdict, but close. Waiting for the next.
A movie that qualifies as strong meat a.k.a. be ready to digest a lot of reality and face the true face of a world unknown to people living in a happy bubble. This movie undid something inside of me. It's that part of you that holds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for humanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the catholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that. Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. "Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us." Indeed. When we witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it, that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, "You can join the millions talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the night." So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedication of the actors to their roles, to the script, the director and the cinematography. The score? Fantastic. Howard Shore did it again!It Could've Been You I've rated almost a hundred movies and I've only ever given out six 10s on this website. I don't rave about many movies and I am tough to please when it comes to film, but this film is absolute brilliance. It is flawless. This one earns its 10 and it is one of the best films I have ever seen.  Everything about this film is brilliant. The camera work is great and the score is underrated. However, what makes this film is an absolutely genius screenplay that is acted to perfection. This script will rock your world. I am not Catholic. I didn't grow up in a deeply Catholic area, but this film still affected me greatly. Everyone should see this movie for that reason. That is something that you have to see for yourself.  However, I'd like to focus a little more on the technical aspects. Beyond the fact that the subject matter is heavy and extremely important to American and world culture, this movie does everything else right. The acting is absolutely phenomenal. This is particularly true for Ruffalo and McAdams. I adore the subtlety with which they both act. It is brilliant. There isn't much more to say. This film is pure brilliance from its opening frame to its closing moment. For both cinematic and cultural reasons, this is a film that every person should see.Priests Secretly Committing Pederasty. An Award Winner Reality Movie. Spotlight is a 2015 American biographical drama film directed by Tom McCarthy and written by McCarthy and Josh Singer. The film follows The Boston Globe's "Spotlight" team, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit in the United States, and its investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests. It is based on a series of stories by the real Spotlight Team that earned The Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. The film stars Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, and Billy Crudup. Spotlight was shown in the Out of Competition section of the 72nd Venice International Film Festival. It was also shown at the Telluride Film Festival and the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was released on November 6, 2015, by Open Road Films. It won numerous guilds and critics' association awards, and was named one of the finest films of 2015 by various publications. It is nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Film Editing, Best Supporting Actor: Mark Ruffalo, Best Supporting Actress: Rachel McAdams, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture. In 2001, The Boston Globe hires a new editor, Marty Baron. Baron meets Walter "Robby" Robinson, the editor of the Spotlight team, a small group of journalists writing investigative articles that take months to research and publish. After Baron reads a Globe column about a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, who says that Cardinal Law (the Archbishop of Boston) knew that the priest John Geoghan was sexually abusing children and did nothing to stop him, he urges the Spotlight team to investigate. Journalist Michael Rezendes contacts Garabedian, who initially declines interview. Though he is told not to, Rezendes reveals that he is on the Spotlight team, persuading Garabedian to talk. Initially believing that they are following the story of one priest who was moved around several times, the Spotlight team begin to uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in Massachusetts, and an ongoing cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese. Through a man who heads a victim's rights organization, they widen their search to thirteen priests. They learn through an ex-priest who worked trying to rehabilitate pedophile priests that there should be approximately ninety abusive priests in Boston. Through their research, they develop a list of eighty-seven names, and begin to find their victims to back up their suspicions. When the September 11 attacks occur, the team is forced to deprioritize the story. They regain momentum when Rezendes learns from Garabedian that there are publicly available documents that confirm Cardinal Law was aware of the problem and ignored it. After The Boston Globe wins a case to have even more legal documents unsealed, the Spotlight Team finally begins to write the story, and plan to publish their findings in early 2002. As they are about to go to print, Robinson confesses to the team that he was sent a list of twenty pedophile priests in 1993 in a story he never followed up on. Baron, nevertheless, tells Robinson and the team that the work they are doing is important. The story goes to print with a link leading to the documents that expose Cardinal Law, and a phone number requesting victims of pedophile priests to come forward. The following morning, the Spotlight team is inundated with phone calls from victims coming forward to tell their stories. The film closes with a list of places in the United States and around the world where the Catholic Church has been involved in concealing abuse by priests.Fantastic Movie Filled with Sadness Going into the theater to see Spotlight, I had read the rave reviews and knew I was in for something special. This movie did not disappoint! Being from Boston, this movie really made me think about my life growing up, as a lot of "what ifs" came to mind. "What if" I went to church every Sunday..."what if" I was gullible enough to have a priest lure me into his lair. Spotlight goes straight to the heart of this amazingly sad (and apparently never-ending) saga of the Catholic church and the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims. The acting is all-around fantastic, from Mr. Keaton to some actors that I am not familiar with, which is an aspect of this fine movie that makes it so profound. Tense throughout, I was saddened to hear that this abuse is an epidemic and probably will never be stopped. The exclamation point was when a member of the audience stood up and told the rest of us "...I am a survivor..." WOW...Catholic Church in the Spotlight. Relevant, powerful and astonishing. Shocking, criminal and true. These are the only words to describe this film as it has literally put the 'spotlight' on the systematic cover-up by the Catholic Church of mass molestation and sexual assault acts performed by the priests in the Boston archdiocese that were trusted in the communities they represented. These 'men of God' preyed on the weak and vulnerable for years and the most powerful religious sect in the world did nothing but sweep it under the proverbial carpet. 'Spotlight's' dramatic importance has immediately drawn the attention of film lovers who crave a riveting production that dives deep into a very real circumstance that has impacted every corner of the globe. Tom McCarthy could not have been at the helm of a better film and what he has been able to achieve in terms of wrestling the attentions of the audience is worthy of the highest praise. McCarthy, along with Josh Singer have written a gritty story that pulls no punches and it isn't afraid to get right into the heart of the required subject. For 'Spotlight' to have been received by the critics as well as it has it had to stride unapologetically into this unbelievable and sordid affair. It needed to expose the sensitive and controversial information that some people may find confronting but in the context of this outstanding production, absolutely essential. It destroyed lives and revealed the blatant arrogance of this pious organisation. The all star cast jumps right out at you even before the opening scenes are shot up onto the screen. Based on true events, 'Spotlight' pushes all the right buttons from the beginning. As the name implies, 'Spotlight' refers to the investigative journalism team who report for the Boston Globe newspaper. They are thorough, relentless and will stop at nothing to expose headline stories that affect the everyday lives of normal American's. When the new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), drops a potentially explosive story in the lap of Spotlight chief, Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), about allegations of sexual abuse involving the Catholic Church, Robinson and his loyal crew go about uncovering one of the greatest criminal cover-ups in human history. The deeper their investigation goes the more sadistic and shocking the outcome becomes. Fingers are pointed, people are accused and the list of clergy involved becomes larger and larger. The whole situation ceases to become a Boston problem and grows to a worldwide exposure. Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo are part of the investigative team as young committed journalists Sacha Pfeiffer and Mike Rezendes respectively. McAdams performance is award worthy and Ruffalo is fully engaged in a role that matches his talents. Michael Keaton has found his niche in Hollywood as a sort after mentor showcasing another strong performance as the tenacious and hard hitting Robinson. The real 'cherry' in the cast is the presence of the magnificent Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian who represents the victims in the whole saga. Tucci adds the class that takes 'Spotlight' to another level with an engrossingly accomplished performance. This is the best journalistic drama since 1976's 'All the President's Men'. Tom McCarthy has centred his narrative within the confines of the Boston Globe's newsroom as it should have been. 'Spotlight' doesn't shy away from the true nature of newspaper drama and the audience benefits from such an authentic setting. Top shelf acting from some of the very best young talent sparks the fire that captivates the viewer. Throw in some true icons in Keaton and Tucci and 'Spotlight' has the perfect balance. This film will be classified as the very best in its category and has set a benchmark in terms of confronting realism. Sit back and enjoy.Super film It won best film, deservedly so. This is a film that resonated with me long after I watched it. The complicated tale of the investigation of paedophile priests in Boston and the publication of it is told in riveting fashion by Tom Macarthy who does not waste a frame or a scene to anything less than the plot or character development. I never felt the running time or in any way disbelieved any of the actors in their portrayals. Keaton seems to be on a total roll at the moment and he is excellent as the head of Spotlight but the whole ensemble seemed to put in a real shift. This felt like a documentary at times and I could feel the audience around me leaning forward as each new revelation is uttered.  Just brilliant.I Remembered Why I love Movies Throughout the year I watched many movies and by the middle of the year I was finding it hard to watch a movie. I really had to force my self. I thought my love for movies is dying and I'm more of a TV person now.  I was wrong.  This movie (and the big short) proved to me that it wasn't me, it was actually the movies I've seen this year. This movie has it's flaws for sure. But the acting, script, direction, design and pace of the movie adds a lot to an already strong and heart breaking story. I was on the edge of my seat and even after the movie ended I couldn't move for a while.  A well made film that I recommend to any drama fan. It certainly helped me find my love for movies again. Even with it's flaws I give it a 9.5One of the greatest horror films of all time ... because by the time the credits roll and you start to breathe normally again, you will suddenly realize that this was not a horror film as such, this was a re-enactment of events that actually happened, with real victims and real perpetrators and real well-meaning third parties covering up the whole thing as fast as the body count kept piling up. And then you will once again have difficulty catching your breath. As a film it is superb. McCarthy who did double duty as writer and director deserves acknowledgement. The cast is universally excellent. Ruffalo gives the performance of his career, Keaton is solid as a rock, and McAdams reaps overdue dividends from her decision to broaden her career into non-glamorous roles at a time when the only scripts they were sending her were for Diva parts. Smart lady. A reviewer is not supposed to interject personal feelings in a review but I will say without apology that I miss films like these -- films that speak for the injustice in society and offer solutions -- and wish there were more of them. It seems that when I was younger there was a lot more interest in doing the right thing merely because it was the right thing. This no longer seems to be the societal meme, and that troubles me. A must-see.If there were 90 of these bastards, people would know. It is no secret that I left the Church for many years after they failed to deal with the abuse scandal. Like the Globe personnel, I had no idea of the scope of the problem. I was just angry that those responsible had gotten away with it. The Globe thought this story was worthwhile when they had uncovered 13 priests that abused children. When they discovered it was closer to 90, they were shocked. The eventual number in Boston was 186! This is not surprising when it is estimated that 50% of all priests are not celibate. Mark Ruffalo was amazing in this film, and Rachel McAdams was superb. Neither will likely win awards in a year of fantastic performances, but there is a chance the film may steal an Oscar. It would be a great thing. The film was very difficult for a Catholic to watch, but it was definitely worth it. Unlike the recent documentary, Mea Maxima Culpa, it focused on the Globe and the story, and not the abuse.Flat Out Remarkable! Possibly the Year's Best! Seconds after the credits for Tom McCarthy's "Spotlight" roll, an overwhelming feeling of changing your career takes over. Is film criticism really where I belong? What important, life-changing story am I not writing about? Truth is, quite a bit of classic films give off that same feeling. "Rocky" made a bunch of our fathers and older brothers go for a morning run and drink raw eggs. "Rudy" made us want to go out and play Notre Dame football. "Spotlight" makes you want to go down to your local courthouse and search the public records for clues. Then, get on the phone, with a pen and a pad, and start asking some really tough questions. Honestly speaking, "Spotlight" is the best investigative news drama this century. Matter of fact, behind "All the President's Men" and maybe "The Insider," it's among the best ever made. "Spotlight" tells the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core. Where you must begin, with any praise for the film, is the audacious and fortifying script by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer. The two create cinematic magic in their articulation of words, characters, and narrative storytelling. Each person feels authentic. Each scene feels rich and equally important as the last. And most of all, its the tightest, most satisfying film from beginning to end, seen this year. From minute one, you're hooked, up until the last second, where they decide the last words spoken should be, "Spotlight" is astonishingly crafted. I'm still in shock and awe that Tom McCarthy is the one who made this. This is a writer/director who I've appreciated but didn't have the "love" factor surrounding any of his films. Paired with an outstanding cast, co-writer Josh Singer, editor Tom McArdle, cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi and composer Howard Shore, Tom McCarthy gets a chance to create his masterpiece¬Öand succeeds. He makes brilliant artistic choices, such as letting a Mark Ruffalo letter reading play over a 2-minute taxi car ride back to the newspaper. McCarthy's direction is one of the best directorial efforts from any filmmaker this year thus far. All the players performing are top-notch but walking away, best-in- show, is the performance of Academy Award nominee Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo exhibits his best screen performance to date, and makes a stake in his claim for the Oscar this year. Weirdly reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's work in "The Master," Ruffalo builds his 'Mike' from the feet up, giving him his own characteristics that I'm not sure McCarthy and Singer set out to do. His expressions in words, mannerisms, all encapsulate the magnitude of his work, bookended by an explosive scene that brought tears to my eyes. Think back to Emma Stone's acclaimed work in "Birdman," and the scene that made everyone notice. I wanted to simply applaud. Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams, who play "Robbie" and "Sacha" respectively, are attune with their characters and destinations. Each bring strong sensibilities and sensitivity to their roles that desperately call for them. Hotly worked into the story is Liev Schreiber as a newly appointed Editor, that in the little screen time he's given, makes a long-lasting impression. Stanley Tucci is also afforded the same opportunity, and gives one of the film's best monologues. If there's a film this year that feels like an Oscar-winner, "Spotlight" sure does make a compelling case. Dramatic, heart- pounding, and necessarily made. It's one of the most important films this year and probably THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR. The Telluride tradition may continue.All the Vatican's Men in Outstanding Investigative Journalism Film Revealing the Skeletons in the Boston Archdiocese's Closet In "All the President's Men", young reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered a national political scandal when they, through their investigative journalism, revealed the White House under then President Richard Nixon was using campaign funding to finance dirty tricks of political enemies, nicknamed Watergate. In "Spotlight", a similar team of investigative reporters reveal a scandal of epic proportions which makes much of the Watergate scandal seem tame by comparison. They uncovered widespread sexual abuse of minors committed by priests of the Roman Catholic Church who, in turn, hid the crimes. Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Walter V. Robinson (Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Martin "Marty" Baron (Leiv Schreiber), Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) work for a group of investigative reporters within the Boston Globe called "Spotlight" who succeed in finding the skeletons in the Boston Diocese proverbial closet. For many years prior to the sexual abuse scandal, Spotlight had investigated and reported on many other ground-breaking stories. The story begins with a quick flash-back to 1976 when a priest is jailed for sexual abusing a minor. The film then cuts to 2001. Marty Baron (Schreiber), a Jewish Floridian, becomes the main editor for the Boston Globe. He meets the different editors and journalists, and learns of work by Spotlight. A Globe column reveals a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, claims Cardinal Law, then Archbishop of Boston, knew Father John Geoghan, a priest within Law's diocese, was sexually abusing children, and the bishop did not bring him to the attention of authorities. Baron urges the Spotlight team to investigate further to see whether the claim is true and an isolated incident, or if there is more to the story. The "seed" is similar to the break-in of the democratic headquarters at the Watergate Complex which eventually revealed the Nixon White House had been engaging in multiple plots against perceived political enemies. The Spotlight team is headed by Walter "Robby" Robinson (Keaton), a no-nonsense fair but tough reporter/editor. They agree to Baron's wishes and begin researching deeper to see if there is a larger story. Their first lead is the attorney mentioned in the article, Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci). Rezendes (Ruffalo) peruses Garabedian who acted as negotiator between the Boston Archdiocese and victims of Father Geoghan. The reporter wishes the attorney to reveal names of the victims, but at first Garabedian declines. Eventually, Garabedian agrees to contact victims, who are now much older, and ask them if they are willing to speak with Rezendes without revealing their names. Eventually, interviews are set up at the attorney's offices. The question then becomes whether there were other priests who engaged in similar criminal behavior against minors. On another front, other members of the team, including Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams), begin discovering the unspeakable reality of other victims possibly at the hands of more priests, aside from Geoghan. Then a tip from a former rehabilitation counselor for priests informs the team that, based on statistics, there may be as many as 90 priests involved with sexual abuse of children in the Boston Area alone. The team then appropriates volumes of an American guide book of Roman Catholic priests, published once a year, which lists the whereabouts of every clergyman in the church in terms of dioceses and parishes. The investigators make a startling discovery. Certain names in the book over several years are listed as "on leave due to illness", "on administrative leave", or other designations of inactivity after only one to three years at a particular parish, leading the team to consider these may be priests who engaged in sexual misconduct with minors. If true, it would place blame not only on Cardinal Law as possibly covering up the church's indiscretions but the entire Roman Catholic Church, all the way to the Vatican. This is a stunning film about the power of a small group of urban reporters to uncover wrongdoing by one of the oldest and far-reaching institutions in the world: The Roman Catholic Church. In particular high marks for Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes, Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer, and Michael Keaton as Robbie Robinson. So much of the story parallels the Watergate Scandal of several decades earlier. As horrible as the actual victimization of minors by the priests, often boys because they were less likely to "squeal" because of the shame, the cover-up by Law was nearly as criminal. Instead of taking the priests to justice, as he should have done, he tried to cover it up by offering settlements to the families, often when the victims were minors. Law and probably other church officials moved the priests to other parishes where they engaged in similar behavior, thus allowing widespread sexual abuse to continue. It was eventually revealed that not only did these sexual predators victimize children in other parts of the country, it was happening internationally.Wonderful drama about the importance of investigative journalism Everything about this movie is outstanding -- the performances, the way the true events are handled, the cinematography. In this day of digital news, this movie makes us stand back and realize what we may lose in the way of investigative journalism as we slowly kill off print media. The lengths the directors go to to achieve a sense of authenticity is remarkable. We are there in Boston in 2001-2002. We get to know enough about each character to make him or her real, but not enough to create side dramas. The focus remains the child abuse scandal in the archdiocese in Boston. That reflects the conflict the characters face and deal with when events make them rethink the focus of their article. The movie is riveting, though we know the outcome.Very relevant and important, but not very good "Spotlight" is an American movie from last year that runs for slightly over 2 hours and was written and directed by Tom McCarthy. It won two Academy Awards earlier this year, including the grand prize for Best Picture. And the reason for this is probably that it is about a really important subject, namely the way it was discovered by a major newspaper that pedophilia was something that existed on a larger scale in the Church, despite many attempts of the latter to keep it disclosed. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams managed Oscar nominations for their supporting performances. I cannot say I agree with either sadly. McAdams played her part well, had a couple good moments, but I don't think it was one of the best of the year in her category. Probably more of a coattail nomination, I remember it was also pretty surprising she got in. Ruffalo's nomination was no surprise, he got in at all the precursors too. But I had sometimes problems with his performance. It seem over-the-top theatrical and it had a touch of one man against the Church at times, which went entirely against the idea of the team collaboratively managing great things. I am usually a fan of Ruffalo and he has good moments here too, but I think a mix of not so good writing and perhaps not the best approach to the role may have hurt the character. Keaton, Tucci, Slattery and Schreiber are pretty much the same, good but not great, but probably on par with the two nominees. It was a team effort and nobody really stood out. In terms of the entire film, I summarized it appropriately in the title I believe. It is a very important subject and it was a strong cast making this subject work with dignity and professionalism, but I personally felt the heart was missing. And this subject certainly would have deserved to make a more emotional impact in the grand scheme of things than it did on me. The attempts by McCarthy to deliver in terms of that were something that felt rather forced than effective to me. They brought in references to the journalists' private lives and how it impacted them to some extent, but it did not feel too compelling to me to watch these and the victims also did not add as much as I hoped they would. The ending with Keaton's "Spotlight" quote was nicely done though. I also liked the way they brought in 9/11 getting in the way of disclosing the events. Overall, I believe this is an important movie that is worth watching mostly because it all happened in reality and because with the Best Picture win, it is probably now the defining film on a very contemporary and tragic occurrence of events. But I still feel it did not make the impact that it could have made and my favorite McCarthy film to this day stays "The Visitor". But I recommend "Spotlight" too of course. I would say it's nowhere near the best or worst Best Picture Academy Award winners.A good docu-drama but nothing more I liked this film, thought it was a well done solid film. But I am afraid I can't say anything more than that, it is very documentary like which can be it's biggest strength (a very fact driven plot heavy film) or it's biggest weakness (characters feel cold and distant and other than the plot nothing really impresses, also quite bland in the visuals department). However the characters do start to show some life nearing the end of the film but by that time damage is done it can be hard if not impossible for viewers to differentiate between the reporters for nearly one and a half hour of the film, they all suffer from different faces but same objective syndrome and inadequate effort is made to separate one from the another. Also speaking of run-time, this film is a wee bit over two hours long, editing especially in the first half could have made this film a bit crispier. However I did like the accuracy level in the film regarding the cellphones, ads, electronics and the cars used in 2001; a lot of films these days are becoming very careless in this regard. I would compare it to last year's Foxcatcher another fact driven docu-drama film, solidly acted, but nothing special in the direction, editing and cinematography department, I would still recommend it but no way this film deserves a second watch, you can absorb everything there is to get in a single viewing. All in all, a solid well written docu-drama which will have it's time in the "spotlight" (pun!) this Oscar season and will become "oh that movie about pedo priests" by next year's Oscar season.A fine film but not worthy of winning Best Picture Going into 'Spotlight' I was aware that it was the front runner to win Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. After having seen it I can't really understand why. That's not to say it wasn't a good film, it simply didn't blow me away at all. It told a story, an admittedly fascinating and true story, in an informative way but it didn't do anything that great films do like inspire me, move me or leave me stunned with the powerful nature it was told with. Best Picture winners of the past, like 'Schindler's List', told true stories but also encompassed all three of those traits and plenty more. That was a film I will never forget, 'Spotlight' will probably be completely out of my mind by this time next week. Frankly, I was a little underwhelmed with the lack of emotion such a serious subject brought out in me. The film just didn't really seem to try to do that. It felt more like a documentary reenactment, simply with very fine actors, than anything else. My disagreement with it likely winning Best Picture aside, there are some very fine filmmaking skills on show here in all departments. Director Tom McCarthy, in only his fifth turn at directing, has been nominated for a Best Directing award. While I don't like the lack of emotion his storytelling brought out in me, he clearly had a vision to tell a story in a certain way, and he got it done. He tells it in a punchy fashion that never allows the audience to drift off. The Best Directing race this year is a tight one with four of the five all being widely in contention. I don't think McCarthy will get the win however, as his film doesn't have the "X-Factor" going for it that a lot of the others do. Having said that, any film that wins Best Picture has to get some real credit for its director, so don't completely rule him out if it does indeed win that. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams have also been nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Actress awards. I have trouble understanding how, to again be frank. Roles based on real life characters always get more attention than others but these two had absolutely nothing to work with in the script. They were almost never given a chance to shine in any scene. Because of this I don't believe either has a chance of winning their respective award. It wasn't a film designed to make actors look good. Having said that, the stand out performance for me was Michael Keaton. He almost won the Best Actor award last year and this year can't even get a nomination. Had his been considered a Supporting Role I'm sure he would have but it was probably considered in that "in between" state, which may have hurt him. There are a lot of true stories at this year's Acadmey Awards and I think 'Spotlight' is benefiting from being the most interesting story of them all. 'The Big Short' is another case of an interesting true story, however that was told in a very unique and clever way. Interestingly, that is the biggest competition 'Spotlight' will have when the winner is read out on the night. My fingers might just be crossed on the seeing the upset.Oscar-Bait Crumbling Under Its Worth Spotlight is based on the true story of a Boston Globe editorial team's efforts to uncover systematic child abuse and abuser protection by the Catholic Church. Hardly fresh news, and a topic that will raise strong emotional reactions, and rightly so. But how does it hold up? Given the weird emotional volatility surrounding this one, allow me to qualify this review (and its writer): the scandal revisited here is unarguably heinous, as are the many people who took part in perpetuating it. My own feelings about organized religion mean I was only mildly surprised, but then perhaps the subject of the clergy's hypocrisy is worth revisiting, as it has been in entertainment since Moliere's Tartuffe. But this is a film website, the medium is narrative film, and so Spotlight should - and shall, in the longer term - be judged. This is a film that owes its success and Oscar nominations to its topic and, to a lesser extent, to its ensemble cast. It is also a throw-back to harder-nosed journalism-based films like All The President's Men - a much better, less self-righteous film. The end result however is a bit awkward: first, the structure is wobbly, throwing us in headfirst and assuming perhaps too much familiarity with the events. The character introductions are very rushed, which means it takes more time to build empathy, especially when it comes to the victims. The climax, such as it is, and ensuing denouement are a bit limp culminating in the obligatory white text on black background to tell you succinctly with words what the filmmakers could not achieve with visuals. It makes you wish, as many reviewers have, that this were a documentary. The cast are uniformly good, with Stanley Tucci and Mark Buffalo the stand-outs, but these are solid, seasoned turns, nothing that cries out "best performance of the year". Technical credits are closer to a TV-movie than a major Hollywood release. I can't give it credit merely for tackling an easy target from such a safe distance, but I would concede more points if it told its story more fluidly and dared to explore some of the more dangerous angles a bit more, such as police collusion, or that one memorable scene where a guilty priest rationalizes what he did in a way that hints at even worse events. Sadly, this chooses to play things way too safe.Spotlight is the Best Film of 2015 "Spotlight" is the best film of 2015 and I will be disappointed if it does not receive the Academy Award for Best Picture. As good as it is, it is just one step short of greatness.  "Spotlight" depicts Boston Globe reporters investigating priest sex abuse of children. "Spotlight" focuses like a laser on what it is to be a journalist, to consider whether or not to cover a story, to select it, to research it, to uncover piece-by-piece, a full narrative, to publish it and to live with the consequences of publication.  You don't learn about the reporter's personal lives except for what you see incidentally as they work at home. There is no romantic subplot; there are no trumped-up action scenes where a reporter punches a priest. There's actually one of those scenes, no doubt a self- conscious salute to classic newspaper films, where you see newspapers being run through one of those giant machines that rapidly prints, folds, and stacks hard copies.  I've never seen a film in which I liked these actors more: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian D'Arcy James, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, Len Cariou. Lesser known actors in minor roles are every bit as good. There is no Hollywood in these performances. There's no sexy costumes or makeup, no grandstanding for the Academy. The actors are dressed in the workaday attire of newspapermen and women. Much of the film takes place in a grubby shared office full of sloppy manila file folders or in cafes and working class neighborhoods where informants are interviewed. Each performer plays a cog in a giant wheel working to uncover evil. None of them knows about world-shaking scandal still to come, or Pulitzer Prizes. They are just, with a pair of tweezers, turning over one leaf and seeing what lies beneath and adding that to the information already gathered. Even though viewers already know how this story played out in real life, the audience gasps when a discovery is made; the audience fears that a rock will be thrown through a window; the audience fears that judicial complicity will keep the story hidden. I began crying half an hour into the film. I was crying at the end. I made audible "Huh!" noises at especially and outrageously ironic moments, as did others in the audience. We applauded at the film's conclusion.  The film opens with a child in a police station, accompanied by his parents and a priest. A lawyer enters. Everyone speaks in hushed tones. "I promise this will never happen again." The police are cynical. The lawyer is smooth. The child is crushed. The parents are heartbroken. The priest appears slickly demonic. The scene is anonymous. Events like this were repeated at least a thousand times.  July, 2001. The Boston Globe acquires its first Jewish editor, Martin Baron. The Spotlight team is considering following up a case of priestly sex abuse. Slowly but surely, they discover that there are far more incidences than suspected. They discover not just one bad apple here and there. Rather, Cardinal Law has reassigned abusive priests to new parishes. Baron meets with Law. Law presents Baron with a copy of the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  "Spotlight" mentions "Good Germans" ‚Äì people who kept their eyes closed to the disappearance of their Jewish neighbors, and the sudden appearance of ash falling from the sky. Just so, there were many "Good Bostonians." It's sickening to confront the many who had awareness of priestly sex abuse and did nothing. Targeted kids were powerless and without allies. One had a schizophrenic mother. Some had absentee fathers. Some were gay. Many were from the wrong side of the tracks. After they were abused, some became alcoholics, drug addicts, or suicides. When SNAP activist Phil Saviano is invited to the Boston Globe's office, and he talks about a conspiracy to protect abusive priests that stretches all the way to the Vatican, he comes across as a twitchy, obnoxious, conspiracy theorist raving about Area 51 ‚Äì someone easy to write off.  The most nauseating reason of all given for ignoring clergy sex abuse: money. The Globe could have covered clergy sex abuse earlier, but it didn't. Over fifty percent of the paper's subscribers are Catholics. Boston is a small town, with a lot of insular Irish Catholics who don't want anyone rocking the boat, or risking various money streams, including the church's significant charity work.  Especially poignant are the scenes where abuse survivors are encouraged to detail what happened to them. "It's not enough to say he molested you. You must give me the clinical details of exactly what happened," reporters insist, to sobbing survivors, who must then re- inhabit their worst memories.  The plot churns forward with the single line of a freight train running on schedule. I was never bored.  The priestly sex abuse crisis is not a tragedy because the Catholic Church is corrupt. The priestly sex abuse crisis is a tragedy because the Catholic Church is great. The film could have become better than it is had it included this theme. Show Catholics feeding the homeless. Show Catholics recovering from grief with the support of their faith. Show Cardinal Law for what he once was ‚Äì a courageous hero in the Civil Rights movement, when that meant receiving death threats and alienating the powerful. That something so beautiful is so sullied, along with individual victims' pain, is the heart of this tragedy.  I am a lifelong, church-going Catholic. I present my reasons for being Catholic, in spite of everything, in my book "Save Send Delete." I salute, not boycott, the Globe's reporting, and films like this. Confession and redemption are gifts we shared with the world.Faith Greetings again from the darkness. Faith. A word that easily could have been the title of this gripping and heart-wrenching film. Faith can be defined as trust and belief. Faith can also be defined as religion and ideology. Few things are more devastating than broken faith ¬Ö the core of this "based on actual events" story of The Boston Globe's exposure of rampant child molestation by dozens of Catholic priests, and the systematic cover-up by "The Church". It's challenging to name a movie that is as well-made as this one, while also being as difficult to watch. We know the story ¬Ö we even know how it snow-balled globally ¬Ö but the raw emotions of disgust and sheer anger permeate much of our being as we watch it unfold on screen. Director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent, The Visitor) co-wrote the script with Josh Singer (The Fifth Estate) and it's worthy of favorable comparison to other investigative newspaper films like The Insider (1999), Zodiac (2007), and even the granddaddy of them all ¬Ö All The President's Men (1976). The opening scene takes place in a 1976 Boston police station. A priest has been accused of molesting a child. Within a couple of minutes we witness the empty promises, the intimidation, and the cover up. So much is conveyed in this brief opener, not the least of which comes courtesy of the ambivalence of the veteran cop as he shrugs it off as 'just another day' in front of an idealistic rookie cop. This is accompanied by Howard Shore's spot-on score, with the best parts featuring only a piano and bass. Flash forward to 2001 as we meet the investigative journalist team called "Spotlight". It's led by editor Walter "Robby" Robinson (Michael Keaton) and his three reporters: Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfieffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). They report to Ben Bradlee Jr (John Slattery), whose father was the editor of The Washington Post during the Woodward/Bernstein/Watergate era. New to The Globe is managing editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber). Unlike the others, Mr. Baron is neither a Boston local nor a Catholic. In fact, we catch him reading Dan Shaughnessy's book "The Curse of the Bambino", just so he can get a better feel for the community and its people. What is most fascinating about the movie is that it focuses on the investigative aspects ‚Äì just how diligent the reporters were in putting the story together ‚Äì and how fluid the process was ¬Ö the story led them, not vice versa. There was no media agenda to "get" the church. Instead, the reporters experienced natural shock as each piece of the puzzle was discovered. One of their key sources was a priest-turned-psychologist (voiced by Richard Jenkins) who helped them put scope to the numbers. Another was Phil Saviano (Neal Huff), the leader of a victim's group, who had tried before to provide documentation to the press. Saviano is the perfect example of how someone so passionate about a cause can be viewed with such skepticism ¬Ö right up to the point when they are proved correct. Three attorneys add perspective to the cover-up. Eric Macleish (Billy Crudup) made a career of settling cases (and silencing victims) for the church. Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) is the polar opposite ‚Äì he fights vigorously to get the victims heard, while Jim Sullivan (Jamey Sheridan) is caught in the middle ‚Äì settling cases for the church and struggling with his conscience. Other interesting characters include Paul Guilfoyle as Pete Conley, a smooth-talking power-broker for the church, and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law ‚Äì the man at the top who eventually apologized and was rewarded with a high-ranking position at The Vatican. The film is so well crafted and acted that it features more than a few "best scenes". Sacha has a brief encounter with a former priest on his front door stoop. The priest freely admits to molesting kids and his rationalization will certainly deliver chills to most any viewer. Since this is Boston, it makes perfect sense for the reporters to be so distracted by the story, that it supersedes the Red Sox game they are attending at Fenway Park. Being that the investigation lasted well into 2001, it's quite informative to watch a news agency shift directions for the September 11 tragedy, and along with the nation, put all else on hold. Finally, there is a point in the movie where we as viewers have just about had our fill of extreme emotions ‚Äì we either need to hit something or throw up ‚Äì and reporter Rezendes comes through with exactly what is needed: an emotional outburst and release of exasperation rivaling anything previously seen on screen. It's a wonderful moment for Ruffalo as an actor, and a peak moment for viewers. The story hit the front page of The Boston Globe in January 2002. The paper won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for its superlative investigative journalism. The report vindicated so many who had been taken advantage of, and exposed the colossal arrogance of the church. The innocence of a child vs the power of God. The story broke the faith that so many once held, and started a global (as evidenced by the closing credits) reckoning and awakening that was desperately needed. The film offers a line of dialogue, "It takes a village to raise a kid ¬Ö or abuse one." In other words, it took the often silent actions of so many to allow this despicably evil horror to continue. In a tribute to the newspaper profession, it took a small group of dedicated reporters to pull back a curtain that should never again be shut. Let's have faith in that.Exceptional Movie About Reporters Reporting The awards season may just have found its first forerunner. In a 2015 movie year that has been average at best without any standout films initiating awards conversation, Tom McCarthy's Spotlight rising above the heap to assert itself as one of 2015's best. With an all-star cast including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup, Spotlight shines a light on a 2001 investigation by The Boston Globe's on the sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. Michael Keaton plays Walter Robinson who leads the Globe's investigative unit with Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Sacha (McAdams) and Matt Carrol (Brian d'Arcy James). Under a new editor Marty Baron (Schreiber), the team begins to unfold a horrific pattern of child sexual abuse by the church that was muted and covered up by high priced lawyers and payoffs to victim's families. As Walter probes further and further into the events (the setting is after the events the 9/11) the investigation reveals layers and layers of injustice of Catholic Priests that were aided by the highest powers of the church in an effort to keep the story muted. It all starts with a featured column about Catholic priest John Geoghan who was accused of abusing over 100 boys. A civil suit is filed but the details of the abuse were ordered sealed by the courts. Schrieber's Baron puts the team of reporters on the case and within days the evil that lurked with the sacred rooms of local churches begins to reveal is foul and despicable face. The investigation goes on for months as the team hits roadblock upon roadblock taking one step forward for every two steps back. But the story eventually breaks and the emotionally exhausted team is eventually able to bring to light one of the more depressing and important stories of the early new century. Michael Keaton was really good in last year's Birdman and named himself many awards and an Academy Award nomination for his part. In Spotlight, he may be even better. Under the direction of Tom McCarthy (Win Win, The Station Agent), Keaton shines and carries a performance of determination, frustration and redemption that is delivered with precision. Nods to All the President's Men will be inevitable. But that was a different era. A different movie. Spotlight is fresh and invigorating in its painfully frustrating subject matter. Audiences should leave with a renewed belief that investigative reporting is of monumental importance and that stories such as the one originating in 2001 Massachusetts are still out there clouded in red tape secrecy and muffled whispers. It is painful to watch at times. Trusted bonds between people, children, parents and the institution that promotes the opposite to what it sometimes preaches are disgusting revelations that are brought to the screen with sizzling effects. The entire cast from top to bottom is perfectly cast. And McCarthy doesn't populate his frames with unnecessary spectacular visuals. Spotlight is instead very straight forward. Focused and driven. Spotlight will be nominated for Best Picture and Keaton should get a nod for Actor. Ruffalo may also sneak his way onto ballot sheets. But whether Spotlight wins any hardware is unimportant as long as we recognize the importance of films such as these. A few years ago I would guess that 99% of the population knew nothing about the Iran hostage rescue highlighted in Ben Affleck's Argo. Spotlight should have the same effect acting as a docudrama that is both highly entertaining and educational at the same time. It is both a very good film and an important one. http://theintestinalfortitude.com/The Spotlight of films In the past 5+ years, I've read articles about the decline of cinema and the great successes of Television. There's no denying that there have been some wonderful TV/web series in recent years, but I think a film like Spotlight is the refresh button that moviegoers have been looking for. The story is compelling, the acting is unnoticeable, and the script seems to flow the way a real conversation would. The writers and director of this film are the "Spotlight" of filmmaking, opening up a sensitive story that people acknowledged but probably couldn't imagine on screen, and they brought it to us in a way where I felt all the emotions of someone finding out the truth for the first time. I watched Spotlight at the Z√ºrich Film Festival and after 2 hours, thought it ended too soon. The only negative thing I could think of was that those French &amp; German subtitles were really getting in the way. Maybe next time, the director could remove those ;)Compelling Subject, Average Film The film Spotlight plays like an average Joe type of movie. There is no inspiring cinematography or unique dialogue floating off the screen. It's a clean cut film about a team of reporters who decide to expose Priests molesting children in Boston- and later, we learn, all over the world. It takes place in 2001, right when the internet was just starting to replace print journalism as the new way people read their news. As the story opens, we learn that a section of the Boston Globe- the movie's title- is suffering from low ratings and no readers. The new boss that is hired to direct the team asks the Editor of Spotlight, Michael Keaton, how long it will take for the next story to unfold.  "A few months, maybe more." Keaton says casually. This does not make his boss very enthused. The rest of the team, which includes Mark Ruffalo as an eager reporter, and Rachel McAdams as a bland one - begin digging for clues and interviewing victims of the Priests around town. Other people in town refuse to address the topic. Stanley Tucci, who is very good, eventually lets Ruffalo interview a victim who goes into deep detail on how his molestation took place. It's rather uncomfortable to hear, but necessary. McAdams also has interviews like this, and soon everybody wants the story to release. But then September 11th hits and they decide to wait. And wait longer.  While the subject matter of the movie is very interesting, I found the movie to be an uninspiring showcase of events save some strong performances- Ruffalo and Tucci are the best in show. Keaton is okay but nothing to write home about. And Rachel McAdams has NEVER been so dull. Why she's the only one in Oscar consideration is beyond me; her character lacks any personality other then to speak like a dial tone and be the sole female on the team. She can do better than this. But because the script is dominated by male personalities (and screenwriters), what more do you expect? Is this the Best Picture of 2015? According to many sources, yes. It's the default, safe choice because allegedly voters aren't going to want to crown far more intriguing movies like The Martian, Mad Max, Brooklyn or Room- to name a few titles I found far more exhilarating. It's an okay attempt to tell this important story about a corrupt justice system and of course the Catholic Church in general. But it's stale when it comes to the artistry.  FINAL GRADE: CThis is why modern civilization is based on freedom of press "Spotlight" is one of the best realistic and serious movies of recent years. I don't want to tell the story, as you will watch it soon or later, but I want to admire the movie and the content itself. Instead of falling into the stereotypical hero and anti-hero type of movies, the movie narrates the story with realistic characters, sensual REALISTIC emotions and incredibly depicts the integrity and handwork of the Boston Globe investigation team. The acting of Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton are great. Finally, the movie does not fall into the category of twisty blockbusters but a realistic movie about an important subject that anyone will admire.Solid Film Lacking Dramatic Punch This was a solid drama elevated by superior acting from a top-notch cast but I left the theater somewhat underwhelmed. The movie lacked the sort of drama that makes you wonder how the story will end even when you know how the story will end. The main problem is that the Catholic Church just doesn't come across as a particularly forceful adversary. We're told that the Church is so powerful and has kept the abuse hidden for decades, but when a group of reporters actually goes digging they encounter some roadblocks but nothing that gives you the sense that the Church was something to be feared. While I didn't necessarily need Cardinal Law to dispatch some Opus Dei goons to discourage the reporters and the victims, the movie would have been more rewarding if they'd encountered much stronger resistance from the Church, public officials, and their own family and friends.Good cast, well-acted, but.... As several other reviewers have stated here, Spotlight is a "solid" film. There is absolutely no fault with the actors, who all acquit themselves very well, and the movie itself never drags. However, there's really no character in the movie whom the audience can latch onto. It's a terrific ensemble, but the fault, I think, lies in trying to give everyone in the ensemble an equal part in the story. Without making it about one person (whether a reporter or a victim), the emotional impact falls very, very short. What the viewer is left with is a general notion of, "It's shocking that went on for so long and the church kept covering it up," but zero emotional investment and reaction. Unless you have a personal identification with any of the elements in this story, I think you will remain similarly aloof in regards to this film.Well assembled ensemble As we know Spotlight pulled off something of an upset at the 2015 Oscars by winning for Best Picture. It might have not been my first choice, still it is a good film dealing with a most distasteful subject, molestation by Roman Catholic priests of minors. For centuries the priesthood has been a refuge for closeted gay men who were then never questioned about their lack of interest in women. Then along came Stonewall and gay liberation and chances undreamed of for gays to live openly. So there was no longer a need to enter the priesthood. That caused a lot of vacancies and to this day the Catholic Church has never filled all the openings. Secondly celibacy is just one insane requirement. Back 1000 years ago when it was introduced we never knew about libidos and sex drives. For some with low or no sex drive it's no big deal. But some of us have needs. Put it together you have a recipe for pedophilia. Not that this wasn't known. Back in my younger days I knew a family that numbered a priest among a few brothers. This individual while an ordained priest ran for NYS Assembly. But one day we heard he was transferred to a new parish on an Indian reservation in the southwest. That was a favorite dumping ground for priests from the New York Archdiocese who got caught and were in too many parishes. Cardinal Francis J. Spellman's favorite exile place.  Maybe Cardinal Bernard Law if he knew about what Spellman did he might have put off what happened to his Archdiocese in Boston. This all started with the expose of one Father John Geoghan who was transferred to many parishes in the Archdiocese after it got out he had a taste for young boys.  What the team of investigative reporters from the Boston Globe did was tell the wider story and the film is their search for evidence. The film is always compared with All The President's Men and how the Washington Post broke the Watergate story. One big difference is that a couple of high powered box office names in Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford led the cast. No big names in Spotlight's cast, just a well assembled ensemble.  In fact two of the cast Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams were nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. You might well ask the question, who were they in support of? Spotlight is a good film, not a great one, but it has a few moments. One that is unforgettable for me is Rachel McAdams on the trail of her story going to the house of a former priest. If there were an award for brief significant performances category than Richard O'Rourke as the defrocked priest would have got it for that year. Watch Rachel's reactions as O'Rourke who is so clearly not emotionally developed starts talking of his experiences. Then he's cut off from McAdams by his sister played by Nancy Carroll who is protective of her child like brother and orders her off the premises. That scene told you a lot about many who went into that vocation. I don't think the great film on the subject has yet been made. But Spotlight will do until it is.Great story, underpowered film The story of this film needs no explanation. It is a very powerful subject and sometimes it makes me wonder how these subjects are allowed in Hollywood. Corruption is everywhere. With the internet expanding and our view of the news changing, as depicted in the film, we have been discovering such stories more and more. The film's execution of its serious subject was not as powerful as it needed it to be. There was only subtle criticism of the Church and the subject of sexual abuse. There should have been more vivid and effective ways of criticizing the behaviour and the cover-up. I don't know if this is even possible considering the power of religious institutions; it might not have been possible to do much more, so we can't blame without knowing the truth. This is not the only reason why I found the film underperformed. The acting was weak, excluding Mark Ruffalo. And I couldn't find myself getting into the story as much as I would've expected to. The story and the subject along with Ruffalo's performance saved this film to be above average. Still, I would recommend it for the story.Compelling, Chilling and Cold-Hard Truth. As a Roman Catholic who attends mass weekly I thought I knew all about the child abuse scandal within the RC' Church and well after watching 'Spotlight' it is certainly safe to say I didn't know the half of it. This fantastically compelling, yet chilling, title has really opened my eyes and educated me on the investigation that the journalists of the Boston Globe's Spotlight Team carried out between 2001 &amp; 2002. Putting the fantastic script and acting aside, my credit goes to the real life journalists. The emotional side effects this investigation would have caused them is hard to think about, but exposing the truth must have been very worthwhile.  Watching the film I found it hard at first to understand how this could happen and how a priest could abuse a child within a parish. But the film follows the investigation very carefully and answered every question going around in my head at the time of watching it and revealed everything I wanted to know and more.  I don't want to give away too much in my review, but I will say this. If you are like me and think that you know what had happened in the child abuse scandal I would urge you to think again and watch this film. That's all I will say.  With regards to the actual film? Well its fantastic. The camera work, the acting, the script...everything about this film is compelling and is sure to glue your eyes to that TV screen (or what ever device you happen to watch on). In the end I am happy that I took the time to watch this, it was very informative and has educated me greatly on the situation and made me think about a lot of things, not regarding my faith, it is still as strong as ever, but regarding the Roman Catholic Church and its hierarchy etc.  Anyway, I'm going to stop talking, give it a watch, be informed and enjoy every minute of this chilling, compelling and informative thriller/drama. 10/10Been there, done that. I haven't seen the film. When I was 10, my favorite, Father Eddy died. This joker showed up, all puffed up &amp; told me, "Father Eddy's dead, I'm here NOW." I'm surprised I didn't crack a tooth. I said to myself, "he must DIE!!!!" I smiled as sweetly as I could &amp; asked him, if Jesus was the creator of the universe, why couldn't he create cheeseburgers for the disciples? He turned white as a sheet &amp; ran from the room.  I later learned he had his sorry ass thrown in jail for molesting boys on the football team. Good thing he didn't try it with me. I regularly beat their sorry asses, &amp; he was a little wimp of a thing. I'd of turned him into guacamole dip. So, it's a little too close to home for my comfort. My cousin said that guy molested him.masterpiece In July 2001, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) is the new editor of the Boston Globe. He wants Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton) to investigate lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) who represents victims of Catholic priests. Robby leads Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) in the Globe's investigative journalism group called Spotlight. This is tightly produced procedural of a newspaper investigation like "All the President's Men". I have no problem with anybody putting this in the same league as that iconic classic. It is that good. It is that relevant. The acting is superior. There is not a lot of flash. It is a lot of shoe-leather work and this movie presents it with great tension and integrity. This is a masterpiece.Superbly Executed Film: A New Gold Standard for Films About Investigative Journalists Spotlight is the best film of its kind I have ever seen. All the President's Men was the gold standard for this kind of film about investigative journalism, along with Absence of Malice, but this film was better in several respects: First, it did a superior job talking about the multiple levels at which the story could be presented by the journalists: about the victims, the priest/pedophiles, Cardinal Law, or the Catholic Church cover-up; Second, it laid out the conflict among the journalists about when to run with the story and why better than any film of its kind. Third, it presented the notion that the story could have a very different effect if it ran in one part of the paper than another. The idea that a story could be "buried," even though it was published, because it was presented in the Metropolitan section, instead of the front page was well presented. Fourth, the conflict among the journalists seemed real, not staged, as far as how to proceed with the story. Fifth, the reasons people chose not to cooperate were well presented. People who had genuinely positive feelings about the Catholic Church were well-rounded characters, and the tension about threatening a Catholic high school with allegations about one of its faculty members was great. Stories like this have unintended consequences, and this film did a superb job laying them out. Finally, the visuals were superb. The juxtaposition of the horrific events being presented and the ordinary working and middle class neighborhoods in which they were happening was presented without being overemphasized. All in all, a wonderful movie, which, I predict, will be a classic like All the President's Men for people who want to watch intelligent films.Great Job A group of journalists runs the movie who's working on child abuse allegations on few church fathers. And police try to cover up the issue.  What I liked most about the movie? It successfully highlighted child abuse issue WITHOUT even showing child in compromised situation. Great Job! Story is well knit and over all the story may sound boring at times but such phase will pass quickly.  The movie proved that you can talk about as issue without showing it happening, which can be devastating for victims and people belong to that group.Spotlight Delivers No question that this Academy Award winning film Spotlight is one of the best films not only during the year it was released but for many years to come. This Oscar winner which features the Boston Globe's "Spotlight" team tells us us how the oldest continuously operating newspaper's group of investigative journalist unit in the United States came up with its investigation of the cases of pederasty that committed by numerous Roman Catholic priests at Boston,Massachusetts.It stars a talented ensemble of actors and actresses in Mark Ruffalo,Michael Keaton,Rachel McAdams,Liev Schreiber,John Slattery,Brian d'Arcy James and Stanley Tucci. It was based on a series of stories by the said team that enabled the newspaper to win the Pulitzer Prize back in 2003. What makes the film is great is numerous.First,we get to see great performances from its ensemble cast.They portrayed the real-life characters sincerely and accurately.The film did not fall into the trap of trying to maximize the good qualities nor magnify their achievements as well as the hard work they put forth into the newspaper unit.Second,the subject of investigation wasn't really an abomination of the Catholic Church as other films with similar themes do portray.It only reflected the priests who were assigned at Boston.Third,it provides the viewer of what a newspaper should be all about in reporting news and doing investigation like the "Spotlight" team.It was obviously not created to sensationalize topics they are investigating for better profit reports but rather for moral urgency and their responsibility to report the truth to the reading public.It also tried to stay away from what most newspapers have become these days and how the team remained true to their identity.In summary,this would make us appreciate them better and it gives investigative journalists a good name.Touching and very emotional! 6/10 Review: Although I found the subject matter touching and pretty upsetting at times, and all of the actors put in a great performance, from an entertainment point of view, it seemed more like a documentary than a cinematic extravaganza, and I really wanted to see the priest's get punished for all of there nasty acts. I'm glad that the director used top actors to portray such a touching story, about a group of journalist, who work for the Boston Globe, and go to extreme lengths to undercover the terrible true story about priest who rape young kids. The fact that the important documents were hidden away, was truly disgusting, and the poor victims, who were mostly damaged for life, also touched me. You do have to be in the right mood to watch this film because it is very one toned and it is one of those movies that will leave you feeling angry and pretty emotional. As for the performances, all of the actors gave this delicate subject, there all, and it shows journalist in a different light, by proving that they also can do good without uncovering a scoop, just for profit. Personally, I don't think that it's one of those films that you can watch time and time again but it's still a well made movie, which brings an untold story to light. Enjoyable! Round-Up: I'm not sure that this film deserved a Best Picture Academy Award, especially with Mad Max and the Revenant in the same category but you can't fault the film for emotion, and the script is well written. Personally I don't think that it needed to be 2 hours long and I did find some of the scenes repetitive but with that aside, it's still one to watch and it's great to see Keaton back on top form. The movie was directed and written by Tom McCarthy, 49, who also brought you the Station Agent, The Visitor, Win Win and the disappointing, the Cobbler, so this movie was a complete change of directed for the actor/director, who recently starred in Pixels with Adam Sandler. He was brave to make a movie about a subject matter which has been kept under the radar for some time, and I'm sure that there are still people out there that won't accept the truth but I personally think that there was room for Tom to go deeper, from the punishment perspective. Its still a decent film which deserved recognition but I did see better films in 2015/2016. Budget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $88.3million I recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/history/dramas starring Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, Elena Wohl and Brian D'Arcy James. 6/10A pretty solid film that took home an Oscar this year. Spotlight is directed by Tom McCarthney and stars Mark Ruffalo from 13 Going On 30 and Avengers,Rachel McAdams from The Vow,Micheal Keaton from Birdman and Jack Frost,Liev Schreiber from Kate &amp; Leopold,and Stanley Tucci from Maid In Manhattan and tells the tale about a group of journalists who work for a man played by Keaton who uncovers the shocking truth behind the catholic church as a bunch of priests were assaulting innocent people sexually and verbally and The Boston Globe team has to find the innocent people and write an article for this shocking scandal that shook the world. Now I had no intention of seeing this movie as I got the DVD of it a few days ago as I heard that it was a very good movie that won Best Picture at the Oscars this year. Th film feels more like a documentary rather than a film as the whole film consists of Ruffalo,McAdams,Schreiber,and Keaton trying to come up with an article for the Catholic Church and to find as many pedo priests as possible resulting in a shocking amount of priests who have ruined the lives of many people. What I liked about this film was the cast now I always liked Micheal Keaton,Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo as I seen them in A lot of films,Liev Schreiber I only seen him in X Men Orgins Wolverine and Kate &amp; Leopold and I thought Schreiber was hilarious in Kate &amp; Leopold. My only downside to this film is that it feels like it drags on and on and I was surprised there wasn't any scenes where we actually see the priests doing the shocking things that they did to the people many years ago as this film is set in the year 2001 since the scandal occurred,and for a whooping 123 minutes it certainly drags A lot.  But sure I thought it was a pretty good flick,did it deserve to in Best Picture? Well it is a good movie but im sure there were plenty of other films that surpass this one. My overall rating is a 8 and a half out of 10 and 4/5 stars. Very good film if you are into these true stories and you want to find out more on the Catholic Church scandal. I myself am a catholic person and I was shocked at the outcome of it all.Devastating Spotlight focuses on a devastating turn of events which were ripe for melodrama, and instead turns out to be a spare, minimalistic entry that knows how to keep things close to the chest and still be deeply affecting. Director Tom McCarthy takes a fly-on-the-wall approach to his technique, showing us an intimate glimpse at what it no doubt must have been like for these Boston reporters as they brought to light one of the most sickening and heinous atrocities of our time, the sexual abuse scandal of the Catholic Church, which rotted through many a priest, parish and law firm who insidiously kept their mouths shut about the whole deal. For the reporters, ignorance was just not on the table, no matter what the consequences. Rachel McAdams is tender and fearless as Sacha Pfeiffer, a keen operative who is first to smoke out a lead, bringing it to her boss, the legendary Walter 'Robby' Robinson, (Michael Keaton), and the executive in charge of the paper, Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery). The matter is brought to further attention by Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), who arrives from out of state. It's Mike Rezendes though, played by a stunning Mark Ruffalo, who drives the point home, refusing to give up and shoving loads of empathy down the throats of those who would look the other way. Ruffalo is note perfect, his determined sentiment delivered with compassion and impact that lingers. He hounds diamond in the rough lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci hides the sympathy behind the sass) to allow him access to the victims, giving him something concrete to go on. The bitter side of the lawyer coin comes in the form of Eric McLeish (underrated Billy Crudup), a passively belligerent guy who is anything but cooperative until the hammer comes down. Richard Jenkins proves that he can turn in excellent work with nothing but his voice, playing a source who is heard only via phone calls. Keaton is brilliant, bringing the laid back nature and giving the character an easy listening style Boston accent. McAdams mirrors the hurt in those she interviews with eyes that echo years of suffering. Tucci comes the closest the film gets to comic relief, and then veers into dead serious mode as he realizes his character is in control of lives with the info he has, snapping to rigid attention. Watch for work from Jamey Sheridan, Len Cariou, Brian D'Arcy James and Paul Guilfoyle as well. The film arrives at its destination free from obvious emotional fireworks, on screen text or sensationalism, elements which often permeate true life stories. It's simple, to the point, grounded and diligent to story, character and truth. That approach makes it all the more shattering.Definitely in the spotlight I was gutted to have missed this at its original UK release back in January, especially when it received some attention at this year's Academy Awards winning two Oscars, Best Picture and Best Screenplay, and nominated for four others I really wanted to see this. So, a bit of a throwback Thursday I fortunately managed to catch a silver screening at my local.  I knew this film was going to be good but didn't know it was going to be that good. The film is about the Spotlight journalists writing for the Boston Globe at the turn of the millennium, before, and after 9/11. A tight team of thorough investigators that chase controversy and when new editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) takes the helm, he politely, yet assertively tasks the team to do a follow up story on the Catholic child molestation scandal that seems to be swept under the rug.  It's a great portrayal of corruption and how it seeps into everywhere, especially where some can make a gain and how a whole population can turn a blind eye and pretend nothing is happening. It displays social responsibility, honesty, guilt and torment as you follow the paper trail spanning what I think is two years long.  Tom McCarthy directs and does an amazing job of recreating a quiet monster, a battle of office forces that reminded me of Michael Mann's The Insider (1999) and Alan J. Pakula's All The Presidents Men. (1976) I loved McCarthy film, The Visitor (2007) with Richards Jenkins, who I think provides a voice for this film, and McCarthy gives that same gracefulness, realism and subtly in his filmmaking.  It's an incredible cast with Michael Keaton at the lead, who, spent time with the real Walter Robinson and researched him prior to meeting him. Walter Robinson reporting on several occasions that Keaton does a true and scary account of himself; which is a shame for the general audience such as myself because most of us don't know how Walter 'Robby' Robinson behaves so it's difficult to judge Keaton's acting. It's good nonetheless.  You can see why Mark Ruffalo got Oscar nominated for his role as abrasive, passionate and frustrated Mike Rezendes, but I can now also understand why the Oscar went to Mark Rylance for Bridge of Spies. That awkward moment when your first name is called at the awards but it's the other Mark. Still, Ruffalo gives a great performance and deserves all the credit, and pizza.  Not sure about Rachel McAdams; she's does great, don't get me wrong but I didn't think it was worthy of the Oscar nomination unlike Ruffalo's. Tony Stark's Dad, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci play great charismatic parts as does CSI's Paul Guilfoyle and Watchman, Dr. Manhattan Eric Crudup. Liev Schreiber has always been one of my favourite co-stars and he quietly makes his presence known even among all the drama and shouting. He almost sounds like Dustin Hoffman.  The film is a superb testament to good, honest reporting and shows us that truth and power is controlled by the people sitting on high and depends solely on how good and true those people are if something is to be done. The meek will inherit the Earth. I can see fans of Money Ball and The Big Short taking to this film greatly, films about people who take on the system and win, a true 'David and Goliath' of a story.

Spotlight is a team of four in The Boston Globe newspaper working on investigative articles. This leisurely paced movie based on true events set in 2001 has Mark Ruffalo playing Mike Rezendes (the real Mike was present in Oscars ceremony) along with Michael Keaton as editor of Spotlight and Rachel McAdams and two others as members of Spotlight. When new editor Marty Baron played Liev Schreiber asks the Spotlight team to work on the left over case of Priest Geoghan case which is investigating a church cover-up of child abuse by Catholic priests. Spotlight team piece together the missing pieces, which turn out to be a global case which takes them against Cardinal law of the church. Director Tom McCarthy who wrote along with Josh Singer has given impeccable work in writing the screenplay with powerful dialogues aided by adequate cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi. This movie is recommended for serious movie lovers only.requiem for true journalism Director Tom McCarthy authored a very interesting first film in 2003 (The Station Agent) and then his career seemed to go adrift into 'OK movies'. Now he hits gold with Spotlight which does not differ much in directing style from his other films, but just gathers a number of very favorable factors into proving that you can get a Best Film Academy Award even taking the 'OK approach' (in a 'dry' year as 2015 was). Let me start with the positive things, and there are many of these. One first condition to hit gold at the Academy Awards is to run one of those big American stories, that play well with the concepts and heroes of the nation. Investigative journalism and people who make the news are the main theme and the heroes of the film, and on this respect 'Spotlight' follows a tradition that starts with 'Citizen Kane' and continues with films like All President's Men and Zodiac. The story that is investigated by the 'Boston Globe' 'Spotlight' team in the movie is the sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests and the cover-up of the phenomenon and of its dimensions by the Church institutions but also by the town authorities, judicial system, community leaders. It's an explosive subject which to some extent continues until today. The 'based on real events' factor works well here because we know that the implications and ramifications of the problem continue until today. The writers and producers of this film chose to use the real names and tried to remake the true story as close as possible to the facts, places, characters. The other strong attribute of this film is the accurate rendition of the 'yesterday' atmosphere to the smallest detail. The story happens between 2000 and 2002, this was so close and yet so far from many points of view. Acting is also very precise, although the homogeneity of the team makes the characters indistinguishable from a moral stand point of view. It's like I missed an element of hesitation, of fear of consequences - the story looks not like what it happened but like the way the heroes told the world it happened. Sure, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, and Liev Schreiber do all fine jobs, and I also liked how many of the supporting actors entered into their smaller parts. I do not believe however that 'Spotlight' would have won the Best Film Award in another year. It lacks the sparkle that make the big movies we remember over the years. It may also be the last important movie in his genre. As printed journalism melts down and the multi-channel TV news and the Internet take over, the public relies less and less on this kind of journalism. People have easy access to much more information, they can change easily allegiance to any channel of news on TV or Internet, they need to make the choices by themselves. 'Spotlight' may be the cinematographic requiem for the kind of journalism it describes.Well Executed Spotlight Movie Marathon V.3 # 070 Spotlight is well made movie based on the true incidents happened / happening all over the world within the Christian Community. This picks a daring story of sexual molestation on Kids which involves the priests from lower ranks to the higher ones.  Excellent Screenplay and dialogues Executed in a much different way. You don't even get bored in this investigative thriller even for one second. The amazing performances by the lead actors especially Michael Keaton (WoW, he is too good), Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams and Brian. Liev Schrieber and other actors did wonderful jobs as the supporting actors. The camera-work was pretty much good reprising the 90s. The major ups of this movie as i earlier said was the story and performances which made this movie so lively and interesting to watch. I couldn't see any actors in this movie and all i saw was some reporters investigating on some meaty news. If you are interested in a well executed thriller with more good moments.  Don't even hesitate to watch this.. This will fill your mind for sure. My rating 8.5 on 10Watch it once I didn't catch Spotlight when it was originally released, but caught it when it was playing after receiving the best picture Oscar. The film tells the story of the Boston Globe investigation into sexual abuse by members of the catholic church. It therefore belongs very much in the category of movies you have to see rather than you want to see. As is common with a lot of cases of this nature the perpetrators escape justice. The Boston Globe have to try and expose exactly what is going on. The script and acting are exceptional. the film undoubtedly leaves a lasting impression. In common with Schindlers List Spotlight is a film that I am glad that I watched, but have no intention of watching again.We the people The only reason my rating of this film isn't the maximum ten stars is that it presents a Jewish guy as a white knight leading Christians in a crusade against themselves. The problem actually is two systems, one being the hypocrisy of the Roman Catholic Church hiding hedonism beneath its claim to celibacy, and the other being the hypocrisy of our mass media hiding other hypocrisy when revealing it doesn't sell advertising. Note that the anchors of CNN's show The Lead and MSNBC's show Meet the Press and Fox News' show Media Buzz are all Jewish, and that those are 100 percent of the top three television shows focusing on mass media, while noting that less than a quarter of a percent of humanity is Jewish. And, actually, Saul of Tarsus was a Pharisee who perverted Jesus' message and some of his disciples into fitting his pharisaical sect. And that's also part of the how mass media sell the masses the terrorist lie that ISIS is Islamic. HITRTA fine but "unnessesary" movie Did not expect this movie to be this popular. Still don't really see why. "Was it interesting?" The subject matter was well handled. The dialog was fine. I really enjoyed the legal manoeuvrings and the extent of the conspiracy. 2 out of 3. "Was it memorable?" The performances were fine, but nothing amazing. The cinematography was rather good in parts but didn't hold up overall. My biggest problem was the reason this movie was made. This could have been a strait documentary, especially with unknown actors. Using known actors distracts from the story. 1.5 out of 3. "Was it entertaining?" I did not care for the end reveal. They did portray research and interviewing as not being mind-dulling work. 1 out of 3. Starting with 1 (because the evidence says so), 1 + 2 + 1.5 + 1 = 5.5 I'm going to round down to 5 for only giving some of the characters incomplete back-stories.Something was not quite right The story is fantastic and the people that were involved in it needed to be recognized or revealed, depending on which side they were on, but something was a bit off about the movie. The performances were great as well, so the only thing that remains is the direction. It was a good movie, don't get me wrong, but it felt bland most of the time, yet peppered with some mildly irritating moments that pumped the dramatic. You know, children appearing in the shot randomly and long shots on the frowns of the reporters, heroic overtime working and watching the morning edition leaving in the trucks in the night and so on and so on. One other thing that bothered me was that John Slattery was cast in the role of a red herring, but otherwise minor. I like the guy, he deserves good meaty roles! Bottom line: I liked The Big Short a lot more. I can't tell you exactly why, since both movies are using the same kind of recipe: ordinary people investigating something unbelievable, but true, the old "get an Oscar" formula, yet I liked only one of them. It was the mood, perhaps, or the dynamism. Anyway, I think there are so many other movies that deserved an Oscar more than this one.99% engaging .1 % punch mission I must say this is one of the most realistic movie i have seen in recent past.After watching this movie i hope everyone appreciate the work by the journalists in exposing the hidden truths of our society. All the characters are perfect.Mark Ruffalo's mannerism and facial expressions creates an aura of authenticity. Michael Keaton's character evolves with the film and compels you to think about your own inner thoughts. This movie will inspire everyone to live up to their professional ethics.I can say that one of the best cinematic depiction of investigative journalism. Character of Shasha who struggle with her professional and personal beliefs are some of the finest moments in the whole movie.Uncovering the sins committed by whom the millions of people believe in. A documentary film would show the real faces of those offenders to shame them. That's the reason I desperately wanted it to be a documentary, then I would have definitely given a maximum mark. There's no complaint about this movie, but adaptation means fakes acting, fake settings and awards goes to non real achievers. Anyway, this movie kind looked a semi documentary and liked the way it was made. The movie exposed a very important scandal. If something is open for a debate in the US means, the rest of the world would follow the same route. That's where this theme was inspired by. It all begins with a group of journalists from the Boston Globe with their new editor instruct them to research on sexual abuse of children by priests. So their lead only gets bigger and puts them to recover more evidence in order to publish. How they come up with the story that shake up not only the nation, but the entire world is the remaining. A collection of bunch fine performances. There's no lead actors in this. Everyone is in the supporting roles. Out of 6, it got nominated both male and female in the category of supporting role for the Academy Awards. I am very disappointed, Mark Ruffalo's performance in 'Infinitely Polar Bear' deserved another nominee. Anyway, this 15 year old story still looks a hot topic. It was a great comeback for the director after critics assaulted him with their words for his previous film 'The Cobbler' only to show their rage on Sandler. It is a must-must see. Beware, is is not your weekend entertainer, but based on the real. 8/10Captivating true story This was a very revealing and informative movie, a much needed exposure of the Catholic church and certain pedophile priests. We are used to seeing movies about sexually abused girls and are aware of their plight, however this is the first movie I've seen that addresses the issue of sexually abused boys. How many boys are being abused in this way around the world and no one speaks up for them! This movie also shows that it's never too late to do what's right, even if you didn't do it before when you first had the opportunity. It's amazing to discover the whereabouts of Cardinal Bernie Law now. As for the acting, it was superb. Even though there was a lot of dialogue, I was kept captivated by the story and its unraveling until the very end.One of the best real life incident based movie in last ten years One of the best movie of the year no doubt , the way it represented the whole incident is amazing . Hats off to the director and script writer Tom Mccarthy and Josh singer . To me the best male supporting actor academy award should go to the genius Mark Ruffalo . What an actor he is !  Michael Keaton also acted brilliantly as he most of the time does , he is a God gifted talent and Rachael McAdams and Liev Schreiber also did their respective characters quite well but to me this is the film of two persons first of course is Mark Ruffalo and second is Tom Mccarthy . I hope it will get the best movie award too along with original screen play . All the best for the movie for the academy award .Appropriate recount of a societal cancer, though not a monumental movie It has the full merit of showing a reconstruction of the investigative process that went into finding out about the squalid trail of abuse and corruption perpetrated under the untouchable umbrella of the Catholic Church ‚Äì spit ‚Äì and making it all public despite the institutional omert√† (you gotta pronounce it with the accent, people; it sounds like the Spanish "Que Sera") and all-consuming 9/11/01 terrorist attacks. Ruffalo is the one that comes through in this, since he's both an elastic actor and a real-life passionate activist; the movie itself isn't memorable or particularly gripping, cast notwithstanding, sticking as it does to procedural moves and case filing. At least, though, it doesn't pimp the story with the usual crass affectation like in "The Big Short", an otherwise timely tale of power and destruction. If not for a straight-to-DVD movie titled "Milquetoast", I don't know why they keep giving roles to Rachel McAda... zzzzzThe Vidiot Reviews... Spotlight The Catholic Church opposes abortion because they need more children to molest. Fortunately, the journalists in this drama are putting a stop to the latter. When Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), the new editor of the Boston Globe's investigative department, gets wind of a lawyer's (Stanley Tucci) claim that the Archbishop hide allegations of sexual abuse, he directs his team (Michael Keaton Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams) to focus solely on this story. Their findings unearth dozens of victims still waiting for justice, an archdiocese simply relocating the accused, and negligence on the paper's part for not publishing tips it had received years prior. The unfortunate true story that shook Boston to its core in 2002, Spotlight's ensemble cast shines as a beacon of excellence equal to the journalists they portray, while the script is detailed but not exploitive. However, the Catholic Church exacted its revenge when the Internet destroyed newspaper subscriptions.  Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.caStory avoids the spike by a gnats whisker Similar in story arc to Philomena, this presentation, though dealing with an equally huge impact story, manages to keep characterisatons Izal thin. Mark Ruffalo is the most compelling in his role adding urgency and doggedness to what might otherwise come across as a flat, even tempered tale. Some mumbling dialogue doesn't help either but these are nit-picking criticisms for a brave effort to progress the exposure of historic and ongoing child abuse originating within the Catholic priesthood. There's enough to keep your attention throughout and you won't regret see this film but you might just still have some questions. Good as far as it goes....I'm sure there could be a sequel.Very boring movie Very boring movie I didn't enjoy while watching this movie, unfortunately i disappointed of this movieSo what ? I don't get it, all these positive reviews, I read the short description of the movie, I really liked the idea, it's a very sensitive subject that had to be discussed sooner or later, but 60 minutes into the movie and I dropped it, like seriously ? It's so boring, all these names thrown here and there, it's dialogue-heavy for no obvious reason, there is no important dialogue going on, just a bunch of workers, handling a case, interviewing a bunch of victims, and voil√†, nothing more. I felt underwhelmed, bored to death. If it were not for the subject-matter, or the actors, this movie would get a zero. So for subject matter and actors' performances : 4/10Loved it and this is why Above being a superb movie, it's a very necessary movie. The story needed to be broadcast to the word and there was no better way to do so than this. This movie had me from the begining. Cinematography didn't really bring anything new and exciting but it definitely wasn't a fluke. Direction was great but the overall biggest and most compelling aspect as the acting. This movie had them all. Micheal Keaton and Mark Rufallo's performances gave me chills. They made me believe that they were the ones actually reporting on this story. I'm glad this movie was brought to the screen, not only as an outstanding movie, but as a testament against time that the good in people will prevail when the evil in people try to hide the truth. It deserved best picture for sure. 8.9 out of 10 stars! What a great movie.If you love a great crime investigation, this is for you! I really loved this movie! Great actors that did an amazing job, fascinating plot that really drives you in and get you invested, it's beautifully shot and really gives the movie its feel. So if you're a sucker for unsolved crimes and unlikely villains this is absolutely not going to disappoint and definitely worth the watch!It will leave you shaken.... Before you consider watching "Spotlight", I STRONGLY urge you to think twice. It isn't because I think it's a bad film--it's amazingly good. But it's also a difficult film to watch--particularly if you or someone close to you has been a victim of sexual abuse. I know that in my case, it was particularly tough because I am a retired psychotherapist and used to specialize in working with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators...the latter, which, I think benefit very little from treatment (which is much of the reasons I changed careers). The story is about not only the discovery of a huge number of pedophile priests in the Boston parish by Boston Globe reporters but the organization's discovery that the problem went all the way to the top. In other words, even the beloved Cardinal Bernard Law KNEW about the many, many victims and yet did nothing to discipline them or restrict their access to more victims. But the film doesn't just talk about so much that we know to be true today but it covers the stop by step process by which the paper began and completed the investigation. Why did I give the film a 10...particularly since I almost never give films such high scores? Well, the reason is that the folks making the movie really, really cared about the subject matter and getting it right. Instead of focusing on making money with the film and including the usual glitz and glamour, the filmmakers chose instead to emphasize realism above all else. Normal looking actors (such as Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo) are used...and they make efforts to keep them normal looking. Additionally, the film has a relatively slow and deliberate pace--again as they weren't interested in making a pretty or Hollywoodizing the production. Overall, a great film made greater because the folks making it really, really seemed to care and wanted to get it right...which showed great sensitivity for the subject matter and the victims. Great film!Excellent Story and Performances Spotlight (2015)  **** (out of 4)  Excellent movie based around the Boston Globe's investigation into various accounts of sexual abuse that was hidden by the Catholic Church. Obviously, SPOTLIGHT doesn't deal with a fun subject but the film is the perfect example of how to make a great movie. Take a great director and give him a great script to work with. Then you get a great cast to deliver great performances and bring those lines of dialogue and story to life. Why aren't more movies made like this? I'm going to guess it's because these types of films aren't going to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office but if you're a fan of cinema then SPOTLIGHT offers a whole lot. The subject matter itself is something that will make you blood boil but director Tom McCarthy handles it in a very classy way. The screenplay is so great because it really comes across as a blueprint on how journalism should work and obviously while watching the film you're going to think back to movies like THE FRONT PAGE and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. The story here is one that certainly grabs your attention and McCarthy does an excellent job at building up the tension as the reporters race against a clock but also race to find more victims to try and build case. Again, the subject matter isn't pretty but the film perfectly blends the drama of the victim's story as well as the drama and moral clause that people like reporters have. It certainly doesn't hurt that we're given an excellent cast that bring the material to life. Michael Keaton turns in another wonderful performance as the main guy who maybe connected to the crimes. Liev Schreiber has never been better than he is here as the man who pushes for the investigation. Then you have a tender performance from Rachel McAdams as well as Stanley Tucci delivering his finest work in years. With that said, Mark Ruffalo steals the film with his remarkable performance as the main reporter trying to bust the creeps who hid the crimes. The emotion, rage and power in his performance jumps right off the screen. SPOTLIGHT is technically quite flawless as the cinematography, the score, editing and every other aspect are terrific. Of course, a movie like this works on an intelligent level because it asks questions to the viewer and doesn't always just spell out the answer. The movie manages to be highly entertaining from start to finish and it really packs a punch without having to resort to preaching.It did not bother me at all... So I have to admit I ended watching the movie after about 45 minutes because it just did not interest me at all. I am from Germany and yes I have heard something about child abuse by church but why should I really be interested in a local (Boston) child abuse scandal which a local newspaper is reporting about? I think this is a good example why not every problem or event makes good stuff for a movie. I was impressed on how many great actors are in the movie and about how little they were able to show in those 45 minutes. So I just found it totally uninteresting and I had problems to even understand those many persons and their part in the movie.Masterpiece That's the most impressive drama I've watched nowadays. Gradually increasing tension keeps you under pressure almost all the time. There are no words to describe the role play of the actors especially Mark Ruffalo who is logically nominated for best supporting role from the academy. Great job for the screenplay as well! Those kind of problems directly linked to the catholic church, media, court and other public institutions are very existential these days. And there is the thin moment , the movie doesn't offense only one part of system, but exactly the opposite! It shows that every part of it has rotten apples and in the same time people with moral values.Spotlight: A new high for journalism As I'm writing this review, Spotlight has already won two academy awards this year including an Oscar for the Best Picture. Although released in November 2015 but in India it is releasing this week. In this era of sensational journalism Spotlight emerges as a ray of fresh light. The movie boasts an ensemble of great cast that includes Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schrieber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci. The movie opens with a short 1976 Police station scene and quickly jumps to 2001 into the office of The Boston Globe. The newspaper hires a new editor Baron (Liev Schrieber downplaying with finesse, whom many Indians remember as the person who presented Oscar with Priyanka). After reading a news piece about a lawyer Mitchell Garabedian, who says that Cardinal Bernard Law (the Archbishop of Boston) knew that the priest John Geoghan was sexually abusing children and did nothing to stop him, Baron asks the Spotlight team (which takes months in researching a case) to follow this case. Walter "Robby" Robinson (Michael Keaton) leads the team and is very convincing in his portrayal of a leading from the front boss. He assigns Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo will make you forget Hulk) to pursue Garabedian (Stanley Tucci), a very busy and reluctant to help lawyer. Ruffalo plays an adamant, sensitive and impeccably observant reporter. Rachel McAdams plays Sasha pfeiffer who along with Eric MacLeish played by a theater actor Brian d'Arcy James go door to door asking uncomfortable questions. Spotlight shows what true journalism is all about. It's about following a story with sheer honesty and utter conviction. Everybody follows a different path and researches the case in their own manner and slowly and steadily pieces start falling in place. It's about even going against the mighty Church which may potentially endanger the future prospects of a newspaper. We live in a time where newspapers are filled with news of child abuse all around the country. Spotlight goes on to show that this isn't a local phenomenon but a global one and even an authority as high as Church can also get involved. There is a scene in the movie where Sasha interviews a Father and he accepts molesting children and sees nothing wrong in it and in fact terms it as fooling around with boys. This gets you thinking how safe are we with such ignorant god man around. It was high time a movie on Journalism made and Spotlight not just ticks this box but with the help of great acting and crisp screenplay delivers a beautiful movie. I'm going with 4 stars out of 5 for spotlight. A new high for Journalism. This review is also available on http://www.wibble.in/2016/03/lights-camera-spotlight/ by the same authorA Masterpiece!! Aside from the subject matter I think this movie is an example of the best the industry has to offer. To call Spotlight a docudrama would be a disservice. The script, direction and the ensemble cast made me feel like a voyeur, a fly on the wall watching these people work. Immediately I was lost in the story. I loose sight of these people as actors and for two hours I'm transported to Boston, the Globe offices and the meeting rooms and living rooms where the story develops. Much like viewing painting or listening a musical masterpiece I can (and do) watch this movie over and over.Remarkable! One of the best films, if not THE best, that I have seen based on a true story. The acting is great and the directing as well. The spectator soon realises that its intention is not to tell half the story, but the full deal! I was amazed by the persistence of the reporters of the Boston Globe in uncovering a huge case of child molestation by people who are supposedly conveying the word of God to people of faith. It's a must see for anyone involved in the profession of journalism, just to learn how their job should be done. Congratulations to everyone involved in the making of it and I surely hope that it will be rewarded by critics.This film is a one trick pony When I saw this film I dismissed it as another film trying to capture attention by poking the embers of something thought of as being a sacred fire. It really sheds little light on how to deal with the subject and just seems to cash in on the furor over child molestation. It certain does not present the 'other side' or much useful information, other than this is not at all acceptable. Priest bashing had been going on for a dozen years and all this film does is stir the embers. I thought the subject was over with the Jerry Sandusky episode, but I guess not. I saw no new territory covered and would suggest everyone skip it. Now that it just won the academy award, it might be viewed to see if it was worthy of the award. Worth of being made into a film yes, but worthy of the best film of the year status no.An Almost-There Case Study Spotlight deals with an incredibly important and recent current event-- the Boston Globe's uncovering of the Catholic priest sex scandal. Throughout the film the characters uncover layers of conspiracy, as well as new twists in the story, and deal with the inherent corruption and guilt in Boston's "small town" atmosphere in that the institutions and people seem to protect each other for the sake of community. However, none of these plot twists come to full fruition, and the film didn't seem to be able to choose any single theme, instead vying to take on too many. A good deal of the middle acts are spent with a moral struggle over what story to publish-- whether to quickly publish attacks at specific offenders, or wait to find the story about corruption at the highest levels of the church-- and also the struggle of dealing with guilt over having buried the story years before. However, these struggles are both brushed off or faded out with simple dialogue resolutions in single scenes. Additionally, early on in the film, the script takes a strong start in dealing with the pain felt by the victims, and humanizing and individualizing them; however, after a few scenes of dealing with the victims, the film pats itself on the back for a job well done and moves on from them altogether. The ensemble cast had fair performances across the board; Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams seemed altogether understated, and Mark Ruffalo felt more like a young actor experimenting with stylized performance than the seasoned and ranged film veteran that he is. That being said, the script succeeds in keeping the viewer's attention throughout the film, and managed to do some justice to the importance of the story and the difficult job that investigative journalists hold. The film was also visually pleasing; there was nothing groundbreaking or breathtaking about the cinematography or mise-√©n-scene, but the muted colors and well- composed shots made for an accessible and easy to watch experience.Breathtaking experience This movie is that type of movie you'll never forget, moreover you're gonna talk about it, spread the word around and ask others around you to watch it so you can discuss it with them later on. Big credit to whole team that did not hesitate to make/produce/work on this film. Everyone who saw it must admit this is one of the most sensitive theme around for a few years.  In my opinion, this was the best acting by Mark Ruffalo so far, his accent, his moves, his speech, everything was top notch. Big credits goes to Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams and last but not least Liev Shreiber who wasn't on screen that much, however he still made a huge impact on whole story in many ways - he was like a shark, silent killer. I can't express enough how important this movie is, how it can change the look on those who were abused, how it can and hopefully will change the life of those who were molested, their families, friends... You got to watch this, it's nearly a masterpiece.A Modern Day "All the President's Men" The politics in this movie will probably earn it some Oscar nominations, because if there's anything we know about the Academy it's that it loves historically or politically significant movies (The Imitation Game, American Sniper, The Theory of Everything as nominations for Best Picture just from last year). This movie will be a shoe-in for the nomination, but more importantly it deserves the nomination. The issue depicted in the film may seem a little dated (the story takes place in 2001) but it is nonetheless an important issue to discuss. The movie is somewhat aware of this as there are constant references to the fact that The Boston Globe could have exposed this issue of priests molesting children years ago and it is a mystery why they did not. Most people would probably describe the film as being slow-paced, to which I would respond that the movie wouldn't accomplish anything more than if it was edited to have a faster pace. This film needs to fill the audience in on details, and the audience is aware of that. It allows the audience to get the full impact of what is at issue here if we follow the journalists' investigation step by step. Spotlight has an ensemble cast of A-list actors including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and John Slattery, who all deliver great performances. I predict that Ruffalo will be nominated as Best Supporting Actor for the second year in a row. There is a moment in the film when his character has to show determination and frustration simultaneously as his suggestion is denied by Keaton's character, and at this point in the story we are forced to side with Ruffalo and the scene is heartbreaking. While the cast as a whole is great, we only get tiny insights into other characters' motivations and perspectives, but these glimpses still illustrate who the characters are perfectly. For example, one of the team members realize there is a pedophile priest living just a block away from him, and his first thought is to protect the children of the area. He cannot warn the children, however, until the story is released, once again making us question the decisions made by the executives at The Boston Globe. My last comment is that this film is never visually interesting, but political dramas like this are not meant to be great works of art; rather, they are meant to create a cohesive story with well- developed characters to root for, and the film does exactly that and more. These types of film rely on realism, and while they are not necessarily documentaries, they need to inform us of real-world issues, and Spotlight never fails at doing so. 4.0/4.0Powerful and maddening Based on fact drama. It's about a newspaper (the Boston Globe) who's Spotlight team (played by Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams and Brian d'Arcy James) broke the sex scandal about priests molesting alter boys in the Catholic church in 2002. It shows step by step how they found out about it and how the Catholic church does everything in its power to block them. Powerful and frightening drama. It's not a loud movie. It's all talk and moves slowly but I was never bored. I'm a native Bostonian and I remember when this story broke. However this movie reveals a LOT more that was never made public. I was VERY angry by the end. It makes it clear that the church knew very well was going on and did nothing to stop it. Even worse they kept transferring the priests from parish to parish spreading the abuse. The movie treats this in a matter of fact way making it all the more powerful. It was beautifully filmed in and around Boston. It's easy to see why this got a Golden Globe nod for Best Direction and an Oscar for Best Picture. All the cast is good--especially McAdams and Ruffalo. When Ruffalo loses control at the end it's shocking. A long and depressing film that will make you angry but it's a must-see movie."On the Side of the Angels" In the DVD version of "Spotlight," there is a fascinating bonus segment where we meet the actual Boston Globe reporters whose groundbreaking story of pedophilia within the Catholic church is the subject of this film. It is not only interesting to learn more about these journalists, but also to hear their own accounts of their research into the case. At the close of the bonus clip, one of the reporters relates that he felt that their efforts were "on the side of the angels" in raising awareness and bringing the truth to light for so many of the victims. As a film, "Spotlight" is comparable to the journalistic thriller "All the President's Men," which tells the backstory of the two famous Washington Post reporters, Woodward and Bernstein, who broke the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. One of the strengths of "Spotlight" is how the characters of the reporters are individualized. From Liev Shreiber's mild-mannered, soft-spoken editor to Mark Ruffalo's driven, hyperkinetic reporter to Rachel McAdams's thoughtful, intelligent character to Michael Keaton's quirky head of the Spotlight group, the characters were fully realized. It is especially Keaton's role of Robby Robinson that is integral to one of the film's most successful subplots: the incompetence and myopic work of the Boston Globe staff itself for failing to report the story when they essentially had all of the evidence in their possession for years. Without giving away the ending, it is Keaton's character who holds the key to this important strand of the film that deals with journalistic integrity. For acting, directing, and screen writing, "Spotlight" is a remarkable collaborative effort. In viewing this film, one can only wonder how many other untold investigative stories never found their way to the light of the public. In one of the bonus segments, the film's director points out how journalism today is turning news into entertainment and that are not even reporters covering state legislatures today. The film focuses on the importance of journalism at the local level, which led to the successful efforts of the Boston Globe that discovered both the enormity of the child abuse cases, but the scope of the cover-up.  This was an extremely thoughtful and provocative film that is deserving of the recognition it has received. This film truly merits its place in the spotlight.A journalistic procedural as good as All the President's Men At one point in my life I was seriously considering becoming a journalist, hoping to write hard-hitting stories that would break down walls and change lives. There is something so captivating and singular about the job - sniffing out good news and not letting it go until it becomes public information. That love for the printed page remains strong with me through the years. Coincidentally, I am teaching journalism in a school now and I am loving it. Teaching it and watching this latest journalistic procedural are the closest I will ever get to it.  The spotlight is on Spotlight, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit in the United States and its investigation into the widespread child sex abuse cases in the Boston area. It is based on a series of stories by the real Spotlight Team that earned The Boston Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. The investigative unit uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.  There is a moment when John Slattery exclaimed "90 fcuking priests!" I suspect the f-word is used in equal weightage as a verb, an adjective and as a spontaneous intensifier of shock, horror, or anger. This is a story that is so insanely criminal that it has to be told but how it is told is the bright spot.  The ensemble acting is pitch-perfect. The talent on hand is amazing. No one one-ups another in any scene and I didn't get the feeling these are accomplished actors doing a job. They look and feel like real journalists. Armed with a keen and focused mind, a trusty pen and a notepad, the close-knit group of four reporters "gegenpress" all the way to the ugly truth. For slightly more than two solid hours we are treated to a showcase of some incredible work ethics - setting aside every stick of hay in the stack till they get to the needle. There isn't a need to preach about the sacrifices they have made but we know it intrinsically when we see Mark Ruffalo boiling two sausages for dinner or Liev Schreiber leaving the office when the sky is pitch black. There is something so intoxicating about watching professionals born on earth to do one job and to do it exceptionally well. I was riveted. The acting is nuanced and restrained with no fanfare and a jolly pat on the back for a job well done. What a breath of fresh air.  Going after a systemic expose of the Catholic Archdiocese, director Tom McCarthy never paints the priests as villains the size of mountains. But there wasn't any doubt in my mind they are monsters, spiritually lost monsters. There was never any need to preach a 3-point sermon but yet the message hits my raw nerve. This is extremely assured filmmaking which gives us the respect we crave for and seldom see in movies.  The film may be a talkie but it has the rhythm and pacing of an intelligent thriller. The dialogue cuts right down to the bone and I am surprised there is no fluff and zero fats lined the bone. Every scene serves an important purpose and if you take anyone of them out I have a feeling the movie will lose its momentum.  Spotlight is a tour de force and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Alan J. Pakula's All the President's Men (1996) as one of the best journalistic procedurals ever. Every element of the film is flawless and the sum of all its parts gave me a tingling feeling underneath my skin. Surely this has Best Picture written all over it (I have yet to see The Revenant and Brooklyn though).  PS - I had a hoot seeing Liev Schreiber here and can't help feeling this movie works like a sorta revenge sequel in an alternate universe to Ray Donovan in which his character was abused by a priest.Understated rendition, maximum impact Despite its imposing title, Spotlight is an understated movie with a methodical approach that slowly gains momentum. It clearly, confidently shows us how our most precious resource, our children, have been damaged by abuse from catholic priests. This abuse has been prevalent mostly in the United States, but it has occurred wherever there is catholicism, and the church has systematically turned a blind eye to the proceedings. Some children have been driven to suicide by this abuse. In 2001 The Boston Globe decided to investigate one priest said to be abusing a large number of children, and the ensuing investigation reveals a huge cover up, with the catholic church using its power to frighten away the globe, and lawyers refusing to reveal important knowledge, and most importantly, an ex priest who rehabilitates abused children refusing to speak to the press. The Globe realises that they are handling one of the most important stories in the history of the newspaper, and their pursuit becomes relentless, leading to a shattering conclusion. This film scooped best picture at the Oscars and it bears all the hallmarks of the ultimate winner: absolute honesty and integrity in its subject matter, a complicated story simply told and beautifully acted by its committed team of actors. Most of the Spotlight team were catholics by birth and clearly this aided the process, the same applied to the actors, with Ruffalo particularly impressive as a reporter of Portuguese stock. I also liked Stanley Tucci as a lawyer who had dealt with many of the abused children, who was at first reluctant to deal with the Globe, but is won over by their commitment to the story. Abuse of one kind or another is a daily story in the newspapers these days, when it happened on this scale in a church it is even more shocking. This film lays out the facts in the most humane way possible, and everyone involved deserves credit for this. This really is a film that surely must give some comfort to the families that suffered because of this wicked abuse. Mary Gumsley4 Journalists uncover the maybe darkest secret of the Chatolic Church. I was deeply affected after watching Tom McCarthy's based-on-a-true-story movie 'Spotlight'. After I left the cinema hall in my town I felt some kind of unease inside me. This feeling was provoked not only by the fact that the movie is based on a terrifying true story but also by how the actors accomplished to bring this story to life with ravishing performances from Mark Ruffalo (Mike Rezendes), Michael Keaton (Walter 'Robby' Robinson), Rachel McAdams (Sacha Pfeiffer) and Brian d'Arcy James (Matt Carroll). 'Spotlight' follows the story of an investigation, conducted by the team 'Spotlight', working for the daily newspaper - Boston Globe. The team of 4 investigating journalists brings to light a 30-year-old secret that has its roots deeply in the Chatolic Church hierarchy. A story, about child molestation, which nobody can be indifferent to. Most of the molested back then kids - 30 years later with kids of their own, had been through many obstacles due to the ghastly immoral act. Some of them had taken the path of the syringe and drugs. Others had gone crazy and schizophrenic and the other part had killed themselves due to maybe the embarrassment they had to live with for the rest of their lives afterward. Most of the kids, who were molested would not talk about the act, because they were in some way petted by the priests and were too scared and too abashed to talk with somebody about this. Tom McCarthy's 'Spotlight' shows us the importance of the investigating journalist's work and also that they have the power to unfold great mysteries to the public no matter how dark and horrifying the mysteries are.BOOORING AS A FILM.... Robbed an Oscar just for the subject matter. So I watched this on the plane, had plenty of time to kill, because it won an Oscar, yet it was as exciting as watching paint dry... We get it that the subject matter is controversial and it's an "important event" in reality. THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT MAKES IT A PLEASURABLE ENTERTAINING FILM (and no, I don't need Michael Bay or ridiculous 'Taken' action sequences; I'm looking for a story that has great build-up, brings in different emotions, blows my mind or puts me on the edge, etc). You say 'WHAT?! You don't find people in the church raping young children finally being exposed by a local newspaper move you in anyway?!" The real-life story/subject matter, yes... but NOT this film.  If your "enjoyment" is just observing a depiction of what we already knew and was established, then this is for you. There really are no satisfying or shocking moments/ending. What you see is what you already know... you don't really get anything out of it. The journey does not flow well. How can anyone find this movie "shocking" when we already knew about the premise and it really adds nothing new to it? I mean, for a movie like TITANIC, we KNOW the ship is going to sink, but the EXPERIENCE of the film made it worthwhile. Spotlight fails on the EXPERIENCE. It is as boring as observing a meeting at an office.  For this to win an Oscar just meant they like to give awards to the 'underdog' or just simply because of the controversy subject matter. This film is on the same level as when 'The Artist' won Oscar - another overrated boring film (probably forgotten by most people by now; as much as I can enjoy black and white films) - which just simply won more for the IDEA than the quality of the film.  Skip it.By the numbers I can't remember a movie that's SO by-the-numbers as this movie was. I don't get the Oscar win. Everyone has that movie that everybody loves but you just HATE. This is mine I guess. Think investigative reporter- movie and chances are you'll think of something more exciting than this. I thought The Revenant was boring too but that's a trimming issue. It had some very memorable cinematic scenes I can still remember. Spotlight feels like a Law and Order episode. Ugh..I'm out.I'd give it half a star if I could - Terrible movie Don't do it, you have been warned. I watched Spotlight and Revenant in 2 weeks. Wasted 5 hours and $30, I should have just stuck needles into my eyes for those 5hours it would have been less painful...just. I don't know what I was thinking, glutton for punishment. Worst move of 2015 Revenant to second worst movie of 2015 Spotlight.  Note to self:do not listen to professional critics, trust your gut instinct. You always have to wander out of the comfort zone...stick to your local films and foreign language films.  I shake my head in wonder at how this movie managed to get an Oscar. There is very little truth to the story, another paper had broken the story earlier and also it was already well known by the time the Globe jumped on board.  It was like watching a news segment that lasts 2 hours. I'll watch Fox News for two hours if I want my news fiddled with and most likely end up with the same feeling of regret. At least it would be free. The actors did not gel in my opinion, there were some fine actors in the ensemble but something just didn't click.
"The Big Short" is educational, relevant and entertaining. Nothing Small about "The Big Short" "The Big Short" is based on the book with the same name by financial journalist Michael Lewis. It is about collateralized debt obligations, subprime mortgages, credit default swaps and bundling. A snoozer right? Not one bit. "The Big Short" is more entertaining than most films in the cineplex this holiday season. Even if you don't know much about the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-08, you will recognize a quality film and want to know more about the world economic collapse when the film is over.  The film uses a multitude of techniques to tell the story. There are fourth-wall breaking monologues, a model in a bubble bath explaining economics as well as a singing idol and a celebrity chef using metaphors of cooking and gambling to explain the economic crisis. There are jump cuts, slow motion, foreshadowing and flash backs. The filmmakers use any and all tricks to explain a complicated mess of financial chicanery in order to help the audience understand. The banks, mortgage brokers, the credit ratings agencies and the government manipulated people in the nation and world into investing in worthless packages of bonds, and it behooves the director and writer, Adam McKay, to use all cinematic tricks to explain and untangle the financial corruption. The miracle is that the film deciphers the economic melt-down well while entertaining its audience.  The acting is stellar from the stars to the bit players. They aren't just playing a role, they embody characters during a remarkable time in history. My mother thinks Steve Carrell was the best actor in the film, for she did not even recognize him at first. He plays against character and she liked that. However, my mother had never seen Carrell in "The Office." His character, Mark Baum, is much like the boss from that television series. However, in "The Big Short", he plays it straight. He is a boss of a fund under the umbrella of Morgan Stanley (but it's not Morgan Stanley, and his team likes to point out), and he is on a mission to bring down banks, to show them up, and to prove he's been right about the financial warning signs. He is betting against the hand that feeds him, Morgan Stanley. I preferred Christian Bale's performance as Michael Burry, an unselfconscious, manic math genius. I haven't seen that frightening look in Bale's eyes since "American Psycho", but this time he's only killing the mortgage backed securities market. Meanwhile, Brad Pitt, under- playing another disaffected former banker, Brad Rickert, helps two friends make millions while they bet against terrible investments, or "play short" the mortgage market. His backstory is revealed steadily and in a way that makes us wonder why he briefly got back into the investment "game." Even Ryan Gosling makes his mark in this star-studded cast playing the prescient "Jared Vennett." Remember, all the characters in the film are based on real people. And that is what makes it so remarkable.  The other major players in the film are Bear Stearns, Morgan Stanley, and a slew of investment houses who at best ignore the coming financial crisis or at worst, colluded in its creation. From the realtors selling the mortgages, to the banks loaning at subprime, to the banks bundling the worthless packages, they were all making too much money to want to stop. This is exactly the kind of over-exuberance that occurred in the 1920s stock market crash, but few payed attention then or in 2007.  "The Big Short" is a dramatized film of true events. And to make sure we understand, the actors break the fourth wall several times to tell us what part is true to the detail and what part is fictionalized to make it more dramatic. But if you are still incredulous, read the book. The events are all sadly true, and we are still paying for it.  Rating: Pay full price (but you might want to see it twice.)  It will take at least two viewings to catch half of what is embedded in this film. This film is entertaining, educational and relevant.  Peace, Tex SheltersAn unexpected and necessary masterpiece Comedy is tragedy + time, right? We're now over 7 years out from the apex of the American financial crisis, which spiraled outward across the world, and yet what has really changed? People are still making millions/billions off the suffering of others, corporate control reigns supreme, fraud is common and remains largely unknown, wealth continues to be ever more concentrated in the grasp of a few, and the remainder of the populace are treated as proverbial rats and made to feel uncouth should they question the system and question not wanting to live their lives playing this sadistic game. Taking 2 pennies and selling them to someone for a hundred dollars remains a legal activity, just call those pennies by a different name and suddenly it's okay to pass them off as fair market. It doesn't sound funny at all, but The Big Short succeeds in turning this demented and corrupt circus into something improbably hilarious and probing. The power of comedy is its ability to let us see something from a different viewpoint, allow us to process it in ways we wouldn't have been able to otherwise. As we might laugh at children for the hilariously unaware things they say and do, so too will humankind in the future hopefully laugh at how completely pathetic and ignorant our present society has been. Martin Scorsese opened the flap up into the circus entrance with "The Wolf of Wall Street" and, while making good points, was perhaps a bit too concerned with his own technique and had a bit too much indulgence, reveling in the frivolity of it all. The Big Short completely blows the top of the circus and dissects it in every way, starting with the widespread fraud and greed in business, and then examining how it has seeped into our entire existences. Even the good guys here are ultimately out there to make money, lots of it. Isn't that what society tells us we must to do, in order to be valuable? It's sick. McKay's approach here is "throw everything in, including the kitchen sink" and that creates an energetic, brilliantly matched representation of the subject matter. This does not mean he is lacking control, however. The story being told includes so many facets and characters that it easily could have fallen into disarray, but McKay makes every single character memorable and illuminates every piece of jargon that could be confusing from the outset. It's a huge accomplishment and a far more important one than might seem apparent. The things that were allowed to happen in the realms of business, finance, and banking are absolutely INSANE and unbelievable. It has to be largely comedic because there's no other way of delivering this vast amount of information and complete failure of our entire society and make it all snap into place so continuously, without being ripped apart by the overwhelming darkness of it all. This isn't simply circumstantial and theoretical and mysterious to a degree, as in Oliver Stone's "JFK", but the cold hard truth. It's not enough to even ask for the truth anymore and ask for answers, we need to question the entire system, a whole web of poisonous bonds that have tightly wound themselves so entirely around us. The work of the film itself is allowing us to project our thoughts, our fears, our anger, and our confusions into this convoluted conundrum. All while being told the truth, so that we at least have a place to even start down the correct path of understanding. It's acting as our own investigative journey in a time when actual news and journalism has become a tiny spec of its former self. We now have more information than ever available to us, yet it's often so shrouded and twisted as to become unrecognizable. There are still those who fear education for what it would do to their own position in life, how it would challenge their own reality. We are still held under the thumb of "greed is good", "thinking you're inherently better is good", "vanity is good". The shiny mainstream hallmarks of a typical Hollywoood commercial product - the agreeable lighting and manicured actors and tidy locations - are so perfectly representative in this film of the emptiness within the characters and indeed in our entire society. After all the progress we think we've made towards world peace and human rights and medical advances and the stability of the human race, have we lost sight of what a fulfilling life and a world of justice should really be? Aren't we still captive to the same pointless rituals and superficialities, doesn't a veritable monarch and royal court still control most everything? We are now living our lives working for something that can be wiped out with the stroke of a keyboard. We are told something of monetary worth that is non-existent, for all intents and purposes, is something we should strive for. Making a bet on the outcome of another bet is a whole industry. The non-existent and ridiculous and pointless directly hurts the lives of many. The Big Short is one of the most important films of this era and one of the best. I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. It is an illumination, a magical pairing of a director's sensibility to exactly the correct form that most fully allows it to blossom and hold water. It is water which the film warns us will be the next basic human necessity to be denied by those few who hold power.The rich get rich and the poor get evicted. Ain't we got Fun Don't know how Adam McKay made deplorable humans, blinding fear, gut-boiling outrage and gleeful shaming so much fun to watch. He brought along his bag o' laffs but planted them in such rich soil so we had to hack our way through the thick underbrush of tainted greenbacks and marked decks. Everyone's in top form. Didn't recognize Brad Pitt for awhile. Ryan Gosling funniest. Christian Bale let us feel his pain and lonely genius. Steve Carell dug deep and came up with a real mensch. Nice to see Marisa Tomei, Hamish Linklater, John Magaro, Rafe Spall, Finn Wittrock, Max Greenfield and talented others working at a solid level. I walked out of the Westwood Bruin Theater in awe and mad as hell.Two-Sided Look at a Great Film First for newbies, the events here took place prior to the Kevin Spacey film Margin Call (2011). So the Spacey film would have depicted events near the end of this film. Both are superb movies. Back to the review. This film is very unusual in that the producers have shown fierce determination in taking a serious topic and making it as user friendly as one possibly can. Multiple techniques are used to this end and they all work well. In fact in places the film has a Monty Python quality. Why was this done? One can only assume that the producers understood the multiple studies showing that the modern city-dweller becomes uncomfortable when confronted with any facts which suggest that he or she was not paying attention when bad things were happening. After all we live in a democracy so the voters should have been more alert? Isn't that their job? The techniques mentioned attempt to appeal to our SESAME STREET side and make the whole thing as pleasant an educational experience as possible. But make no mistake, this is an educational movie. One that should be mandatory for adults. Like getting a driving test before a license. How about learning about Wall Street and the banks before you invest with them...? Carell steals the film and may finally get the attention he deserves. Great actor. Finally the message. The film suggests not only that Wall Street is corrupt but that the corruption extends to the agencies mandated to supervise Wall Street and (possibly) to Washington itself. The implicit message, conveyed in the end credits, that unless we deal with the problem at the source the symptoms will keep happening over and over and over. Duh!Four "outsider" Wall Street entities capitalize on an impending financial collapse of the US financial system. Reviewed by Larry Gleeson. Viewed during the AFI Filmfest 2015. "The Big Short," directed by Adam McKay, based on the book by Michael Lewis, was adapted by McKay and Charles Randolph and made its world premiere Thursday, November 12, 2015 at the historic TCL Grauman's Chinese Theater as the closing night film for the latest edition of the American Film Institute's AFI FEST film festival. The film's narrative is driven by four cynical, fringe Wall Street entities disgusted with the large banking institutions' overriding greed for profits. They make the decision to capitalize on the ensuing housing market calamity and the financial meltdown of 2008 upon discovering the market frenzy is being driven by worthless collateral debt obligations. McKay chooses to inject a significant dose of humor in the early scenes to condition the audience receptors for what they are about to experience. Utilizing the Martin Scorsese docudrama style in a similar setting with "Wolf of Wall Street," a strong narrative voice dominates particular moments. Several of these deliberately break the 'Fourth Wall" in the style of "Wolfie," Jordan Belfort, as the characters, including a hilarious cameo by Selena Gomez, speak directly into the camera to explain the complexities of Wall Street finance. The overall effect adds additional humor and adds another layer in creating a sense of authenticity and truth about the film's subject matter. After a rather lengthy dizzying, yet delightful, character introduction, the film picks up pace as the drama begins to unfold. Dr. Michael Burry, an eccentric financial analyst, with complete autonomy of an investment fund, uncovers variables in his economic forecast indicating a massive housing market collapse. He informs his higher up, Lawrence Fields, played convincingly by Tracy Letts, of his discovery and creates a financial prospectus. In essence, he creates a commodity of selling short on bundled mortgages. The bankers laugh as they willingly sell Burry all the "insurance" he wants. Word quickly spreads of Burry's perceived madness in a after-work cocktail scene. With interest piqued upon overhearing the Wall Street gossip of the day, Jarred Bennett, portrayed by Ryan Gosling, scoops up the essence of Burry's move. Soon, he sells a group led by Steve Carell's all-too-human, Mark Baum to buy in. As the debacle is in full free-fall, Baum struggles with disbelief as he and his group have bet against their own umbrella entity, Morgan Stanley. The final team that has uncovered the impending financial crisis, made up of two Wall Street neophytes and veteran Ben Rickert, played by one of the film's producers, Brad Pitt, also struggles with the imploding financial system caused by corporate greed and indifference. With a mammoth cast, McKay draws on a plethora of talent in the likes of Hollywood A-listers including Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Selena Gomez, Christian Bale, Karen Gillan Steve Carell, Marisa Tomei, Melissa Leo and Finn Wittrock. McKay and Randolph create characters with witty dialogue coupled with complementary cinematography provided by Barry Ackroyd. The soundtrack carries a similar tone of "Wolf of Wall Street," with a compilation of classic rock anthems. Nicholas Britell widely recognized for his work on Steve McQueen's "12 Years a Slave," where Britell composed on set the on-screen violin performances, work songs, dances and spiritual songs rarely misses a beat this time out. Much like another AFI FEST 2015 film, "The Clan," Argentina's official entry to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Best Foreign Language Category for Oscar, "The Big Short," musical score is often in juxtaposition to the the narrative and mies-en-scene adding a deeper visceral quality to the viewing experience. In its most basic essence, "The Big Short," builds on the visceral truth of Scorsese's "Wolf of Wall Street." It depicts a not-so-long-ago present where a noble ideal, making home ownership a reality for Americans, is bastardized by the indifferent market forces of capitalism. Probably not what Adam Smith had in mind when he penned his treatise, "The Wealth of Nations." Warmly Recommended.Smart Greed Harry Knowles once wrote a review of Das Boot that said the movie was so well made that you'd find yourself rooting for Nazi sailors trying to sink American ships. So here. You find yourself rooting for clever "outsiders and weirdos," as one of them puts it, who saw what nobody else wanted to see -- that an immense structure of mortgage based securities was doomed to collapse because it rested on the backs of subprime borrowers who couldn't support the weight and should never have been loaned the money. We have been taught by generations of fiction to identify with characters who are outsiders and rebels. Because these guys are smart, because they are antisocial and because they were laughed at by smug fools who believed the conventional wisdom, you identify with them, and you wait anxiously for their vindication. Then you realize that their vindication means the collapse of the American economy. They were the guys on the Titanic who knew what the iceberg meant. Michael Lewis, from whose book the movie was adapted, got his training at Salomon Brothers in the mid-80s, as mortgage based securities were being invented. (There's an early shout-out to Lew Ranieri, the Salomon trader who invented them.) As anyone knows who's read Lewis's memoir of those days, Liar's Poker, the culture at Salomon was that your job was to be smarter than everybody else in the bond market, understand values better, and know what other traders were going to do before they knew it themselves. If you were smart enough, you deserved whatever you took away from somebody less smart on the other side of the trade. That's why Lewis admires his protagonists and that, despite a thick coating of moral outrage, is the heart of the movie. The guys who shorted the housing market weren't any more virtuous or less greedy than the great majority of complacent, conventionally minded bankers who believed that the trees would keep growing all the way up to the sky. They just saw more clearly and had plenty of nerve and faith in their own judgment. If they had been wrong, as shorts often are, they and their clients would have been wiped out. When they turned out right, they took the money and kept it, even if some of them felt guilty about it.  I know somewhat about this area, having litigated some of the aftermath. The celebrity cameo explanations of subprime debt, collateralized debt obligations, and synthetic CDOs are not only simple but accurate -- the two involving Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez are downright elegant. The key concept of the credit default swap comes out nicely through the dialogue -- a chance to buy fire insurance on the house down the street just before it catches fire. There are a couple of more points that could have used the same thing, especially when people start talking about "FICO scores." It could also have been a little more clear that the eventual collapse was delayed because the smarter investment banks like Goldman finally woke up, saw it coming, unloaded their CDO inventory on investors who were still asleep, and cut their losses by buying swaps themselves. But this is a smart, entertaining telling of an outrageous true story. It deserves all the praise it has gotten, and maybe an Oscar for best adapted screenplay. If it teaches people without a financial background a little of what went on, it will be more than a momentary entertainment. But it will certainly entertain.A delightful merging of information and comedy No subject in the world is inherently interesting or uninteresting, for it's always about the communicative method or channel used to promote or inform one about the subject that is either interesting or not. Having said that, some subjects are more alienating than others, and one of those subjects is economics/finance, largely because of its dependency upon a plethora of terminology and jargon that usually cannot be adequately defined without including other terminology or jargon. Before you know it, searching the definition of something like a "Roth IRA" leads you to Google searches about embezzlement and quantitative easing in efforts to try and circumvent and define what you were originally looking for. Thankfully, Adam McKay's The Big Short assumes the audience is fairly stupid and blissfully ignorant when it comes to the interworkings of what led to the global economic crisis of 2007-2008, which saw record unemployment and catastrophic results for the usually reliable housing market. In true movie fashion, we observe the financial crash, not from an insider standpoint, where sure-fire, grade-A trades and exchanges are being made, but by a plethora of quirky outsiders trying to run away from a boulder that keeps gaining on them until it flattens them and everyone in their tracks. The only ones saved are the ones who didn't manage to fall or stumble when pushing said boulder down the hill in the first place. We initially meet a quirky hedge fund manager named Michael Burry (Christian Bale), who discovers that the U.S. housing market is based on a series of subprime loans (which, we are told by Margot Robbie as she soaks in a bubblebath whilst sipping champagne, may as well be synonymous with "s***") and is inevitably going to collapse sometime in the second quarter of 2007. Being that the housing market is often viewed as the safest bet in America, Michael begins to go around to different banks to bet against the stability and long-term security of the housing market in efforts to profit from the impending disaster. Then there's Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), a fairly small-time investor, who winds up putting in his own money to bet against the housing market, along with Mark Baum (Steve Carell), a cynical and depressed banker of many years. The two wind up discovering that the market collapse is further aided by the solicitation of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), basically collections of the aforementioned subprime loans that come packaged together and market as competent and reliable investments. Finally, there's Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock), two young-bloods anxious to break into the financial market. The inexperienced duo enlist in the help of a retired, conservative banker named Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), who helps them make decisions with their money. Unlike the other more experienced men, both Charlie and Jamie lack the kind of gusto and namesake that allows them into the offices of big name bankers. As a result, they pine for a bigger piece of the pie in a smaller way, largely by lounging in their parents' basements, hunched over their iPads. The Big Short functions as a competent, satirical anthology that breaks down the financial crisis - that is now nearly a decade old, if you can believe that - enough to be informative and entertaining. Considering this is from Adam McKay, a frequent collaborator with Will Ferrell and Funny or Die, responsible for films like Casa De Mi Padre, The Other Guys, and Step Brothers, this is a huge step in the right direction for him as a name in comedy and satire. Rather than focusing on a bargain-barrel Spanish telenovela satire or a tired, mean-spirited comedy based around who can yell the loudest, McKay sets his sights on peddling information through the most communicable form - entertainment. If you can succeed in meriting consistent laughs while teaching an audience something, you have profoundly succeeded at two things many have a difficult time accomplishing in a separate sense. That alone is worth considerable praise. While the screenplay by McKay and Charles Randolph is undoubtedly a big part at why this film succeeds, The Big Short is a true testament to brilliant comedic acting on various cylinders, as well. The men of the hour, specifically, are both Bale and Carell, seriously taking on opposite personas that they pull off to a tee. Bale plays confused and downright quirky with just the right amount of edge to make him believable rather than hopelessly incompetent or downright silly, and Carell's sporadic bouts of rage and lack of self-awareness make him all the more watchable screen presence. Other performances, like Gosling's, who serves as the infrequent, anti-hero narrator, is notable for its brash charm, in addition to Pitt, who works largely because he's even more understated and harder to define than in his latest film By the Sea. The Big Short has a lot of comedic value, but it's nonetheless a frightening depiction of where America is currently at; a depressing oligarchy, controlled and manipulated by those with money at the mercy of those without. We've seen "The Great Recession of 2007," as it's sometimes called, plunge numerous working class and poor families into further states of hopelessness, while those who helped cause and further the effects of the recession have gone on to have a road of many ups and few downs since then. McKay's eye, ear, and talent for conducting satire in a way that's simultaneously uproariously funny, in addition to having the ability to be truly upsetting, is quite marvelous and unexpected, and one can only hope that with proper recognition and compensation for his efforts on this film, he furthers down this path rather than the one he was previously on.Right on the Money and on the Fraud 'The Big Short' is a winner. Based on Michael Lewis book of the same title, it tells the sorry story of the fraud and deceit practiced on the American people, nay, on the world by Wall Streets finance capitalism. We know the culprits: Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Lehman Bros., Morgan Stanley, Citibank, Wachovia, Crdit Suisse, UBS and on and on who invented financial instruments such as CDO, credit swaps and other fancy unintelligible names, based on mortgages, with the connivance of the credit agencies--Dow Jone, Standard and Poors and Fitch. 'The Big Short' with a light seriousness is a crash course on the duplicity of Wall Street investment bankers who earned large fees on junk bonds with triple A ratings; who bundled junk to palm off on an unsuspecting public looking for big gains by pandering to the snake oil exilir of getting rich quickly; and who feed on the niavety of the broad American have-nots with the dream of owning a home of their own. And so with some humor but much sadness are we lead through the byways of four different groups of bankers who saw the hoax for what it was and its impending implosion that would bring down the deck of cards of capitalism. And the took out bets on the market, by buying short. And they won big time! But the banks are still around, and the ratepayers footed the bailout, but at what cost! And we see this in the turmoil of the Republican party: for the discontent abroad in the US has thrown more than 25 percent of the population into poverty, loss of jobs, home, into heavy debt and no future for their children. And these banks have not reformed their ways...now they've come up with the same of gimmicks with a fancy name--something like beneficial financial tranche--as the play the same old mug's game. And like the Bourbons, t The cast is stellar--especially Christian Bale and Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling as well as the minor players. And like the Bourbons, in the words of Talleyrand, 'they learned nothing and forgot nothing', but the contempt they have for all of us. And to make the case stronger, the fools on the Supreme Court have strengthened the hands of big money and the oligopoly and the fat cats of Wall Street and the coupon clippers and the devil take the rest of us!One of 2015's best films Adam McKay's "The Big Short" is the best financial movie I have seen since watching Oliver Stone's "Wall Street" (1987), but the only difference between these two movies is that this movie was based on true events. The film takes place before and during the recession of 2008 in which some aspects of this movie are pretty funny if you ask me. The movie was adapted from the book by Michael Lewis and it basically starts off with Dr. Michael J. Burry (Christian Bale) who was the first person to predict the housing market crash by actually betting against the housing market before it actually happened despite everyone else thinking that he was a crazy person. Then 20 minutes into the film we see a banker named Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) talk to a Morgan Stanley employee named Mark Baum (Steve Carell) and his coworkers and Vennett tells them that not long from now the economy is going to collapse and that nobody was even talking about it. also during the movie and in between all of the financial conversations Baum is going through a personal tragedy that I will not reveal in this review for those people that haven't seen the movie, and Baum is getting comforted between phone calls and at home by his wife (Marisa Tomei). The screenplay for this movie by McKay along with Charles Randolph took home the Oscar last year for best adapted screenplay and I had a few minor gripes with it here and there but then again it was directed by a man who normally does comedies. Then later in this movie we see 2 other men in the finance world (John Magaro and Finn Wittrock) end contacting a retired trader by the name of Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) who is the fourth person to predict the collapse of the housing market. the only major problem I had with this movie was the shaky camera angles which could have been improved on, and also I think that Adam McKay could have been more impartial instead of openly mocking the corporations but then again that is just my opinion, but otherwise the performances from Bale (who got an Oscar nomination), Gosling, Carell, and Pitt are top notch, as well as Marisa Tomei's. This is one of last year's greatest achievements in film, and I stand by this review.Informative and somehow interesting... First of all don't be fooled by other reviews. This movie is neither a crap nor a masterpiece. It has a lot of technical terms and jargon from the world of economics and despite the obvious effort to explain things (including breaking the 4th wall (i.e. talking direct to the audience while looking into the camera), and cameo appearances from movies stars like Margot Robbie and Selina Gomez) you will probably fail to understand in depth the mechanics of what is happening. The world of banks, funds, bonds, financing and the stock market will remain a mystery for most of the viewers. Big names of Hollywood star in the Big Short including Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and others. They play real persons, who had an insight on the global economic crisis we probably still experiencing. As a movie it has its own style. Something of a documentary, a comedy sometimes, but essentially a drama since the crisis cost 8 million people their job and their homes. People who are impressed easily might tell you this is a "masterpiece". Believe me it isn't. But I recommend to see it. Even better at home where you can pause or rewind the movie to understand better. It is lengthy (130min) but you won't get bored. It needs some patience though especially in the beginning and not to be disappointed when terms like CDO, payouts etc. are starting to emerge.Surprisingly fun ride! This is one of the best films of the year, hands down. It was just incredible. This film takes a subject matter that could be considered boring by some, and totally draws you into it. It finds creative ways to break everything down for the audience, and makes it entertaining. I love how it's self aware, even at some points straight up going, "This isn't how it happened, but it's way more interesting this way." I love how it breaks the 4th wall, with celebrities who make cameos to explain complicated things to the audience. It's brilliant. I left this movie angry that this happened, it really gets you thinking.  Adam Mckay's script is fantastic. The characters are very well written, which every one being interesting and well developed. The film effortlessly blends comedy with drama, one minute making you laugh out loud, and and then it stops you right in it's tracks. There are some really heartbreaking moments here.  The acting is just phenomenal, and this is Steve Carell's best performance. It's just incredible. If he's not nominated an Oscar for this, it's robbery. It's easily better than his Foxcatcher performance. Christian Bale is great as well, playing the socially awkward Michael Burry. Brad Pitt with his limited screen time was great as well. Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer here, he's hilarious.  He's really the only character not struggling here, he's making money off all of it. This movie is extremely stylish, with brilliant editing that I hope wins it an Oscar. This film does everything it can to make everything fun, and it does a great job. This is as entertaining as it is thought provoking. Adam Mckay should tackle drama more often, as he did an extraordinary job with this. 9.5/10A fast-paced ride filled with fascinating personalities When everything in your life is looking rosy, there is always someone who will tell you that your happiness is on shaky ground. Though most of the time these nay-sayers will not profit from your misfortune, such is not the case in The Big Short, Adam McKay's ("Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues") hard-hitting comedy/drama about the collapse of the housing market in 2008. Based on the book "The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine" (2010) by Michael Lewis with a screenplay by McKay and Charles Randolph ("Love and Other Drugs"), the film centers on a group of Wall Street functionaries who, despite the industry, government, and media telling them otherwise, discover that the market for bonds based on subprime mortgages is on shaky grounds and is doomed to collapse. Supported by an outstanding ensemble cast that includes triple A-rated performers like Brad Pitt ("By the Sea") Christian Bale ("Knight of Cups"), Steve Carell ("Foxcatcher"), and Ryan Gosling ("Only God Forgives"), McKay takes highly complex material and molds it into an involving narrative that follows three sets of characters, each running on parallel paths, all intent with cashing in on the system at the expense of the average citizen. The film is narrated by Ryan Gosling who explains at the beginning that our picture of bankers as stolid and conservative citizens no longer fits the reality. They have gone, he says, "from the country club to the strip club." Like Michael Burry (Bale), they even go barefoot, sport a glass eye, listen to heavy metal music and are not the least concerned with what passes for social graces. Burry examines thousands of individual mortgages and realizes that a large number of subprime housing mortgages are "junk" and will collapse sooner rather than later. With no purpose in mind other than to benefit financially from the expected bursting of the housing bubble, Burry puts over a billion dollars of his company's money into what are known as "credit default swaps," an agreement insuring the buyer in the event of a loan default, in essence, betting against not only the housing market but the American economy. These investments, disparaged by the banks, come to the attention of Jared Vennett (Gosling), a subprime mortgage bond manager who goes into business with hedge-fund manager Mark Baum (Carell). Baum, still mourning the recent suicide of his brother is, in many ways, the film's most interesting character - abrasive and bullying, yet honest with a fine-tuned BS detector. The business also proves interesting to young investors Charles Geller (John Magaro, "Carol") and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock, "The Submarine Kid"), who recruit the knowledgeable ex-banker Ben Rickert (Pitt) to use his connections to help them work directly with the banks. At one point, Baum's team investigate a housing subdivision in Florida where they find out that many homes are in foreclosure, that mortgages were bought using the name of the family dog, and a stripper owns five homes with variable rate mortgages. Baum shudders when some young brokers tell him how they have made millions by selling subprime mortgages to the poor and to unsuspecting immigrants. To add more spice to proceedings, McKay uses celebrities talking directly to the camera in order to explain the complicated terminology used by bankers to make sure the average person has no idea what's going on. Provocatively sitting in a bubble bath and drinking champagne, actress Margot Robbie ("The Wolf of Wall Street") explains the ins-and-outs of mortgage-backed securities, while TV food personality Anthony Bourdain compares an unappetizing seafood stew with banks who market bad mortgages as a triple-A rated financial product. There is also a clever demonstration at a casino gambling table using actress Selena Gomez ("Behaving Badly") to show how Credit Default Obligations (CDOs), the bundling of bad mortgages, can lead to layers and layers of speculation. The three groups of characters cross paths at the American Securities Forum in Las Vegas where it soon becomes evident that the housing market is built on fraud and the banks are massively concealing the worthlessness of their holdings. The Big Short is one of the best films of the year, a fast-paced ride filled with fascinating personalities that entertains even when it infuriates. The mood only turns dark when you realize that the stakes are bigger than winning a game of Monopoly, bigger than who was right and who was wrong. When the market collapses in 2008 sending the economy into a tailspin, it is Rickert who points out to anyone left who still cares that the consequences for real people are not the loss of stocks but the loss of their homes, their livelihood, and, in some cases, their lives. Not to worry, though, it's not personal, just business.Tough to watch... for all the right reasons This film is tough to watch having lived through the housing crisis and unemployment meltdown of 2007 to present. It inspires righteous indignation and they are a lot of unlikable people that you encounter throughout the film. Don't get the wrong impression, this film is an absolute necessity on raw economics majors and even the fringe behavioral economists. We now spend a tremendous amount of time discussing the poor leadership and lack of responsibility that we encountered during that time period but nothing of such gross negligence should escape unnoticed (according to the film maybe it didn't). That it still shows that intelligent people will prosper even from the most ignorant, gross misconduct is somewhat painful to watch. Generally speaking, these are the films that don't make a lot of headway on the road to the Oscars but the cast is very stellar and is undeniable in their efforts to bring the story life from a very real point of view. Not shocking to me, Steve Carell turns in a superb effort with a highly nuanced performance overall. I wish them all the best on the road to the Oscars. Having lived through the time period, I never read the book but the last 6 to 10 minutes of the film make your stomach hurt long after the ending. If the point in cinema is to get a reaction or some sort of a dialogue started this movie is highly successful. This movie may bore the poop out of kids through the mid- to late 20s... but it is a hot weapon against the machine for anybody who is beyond that age range. Historical economic movies don't usually do well at the box office but pick up a hellacious head of steam later on if they're on target and this movie is. I recommend you catch it in theaters and have an interesting conversation on the way out to the parking lot and beyond.Excellent, ultimately bleak Accomplished and informative movie from Adam McKay and his team. Special kudos to Hank Corwin for his fast but never flashy editing. Superbly acted, with a nice little part for co-producer Brad Pitt, who is always at his best in supporting roles. Looking at some of the message board postings about this movie, it's evident that the blame game for the financial meltdown of 2007/8 continues, which kind of misses the point of the movie, which is that the whole thing has started up again. Neither governments, nor banks, nor the public seem to care enough about the damage of a cycle of boom and bust to really do anything about it. They ‚Äì we ‚Äì smell money. Excellent film. Mostly funny. Ultimately bleak.convoluted Famous writer director, Bill Wilder said if you are telling a complicated story you have to tell it in a simple way. He was right. This film wants to be funny and savvy and meaningful those are all great goals but it doesn't really achieve them. The story telling is as spastic as the camera-work is jerky, and the more it tries to make the back room dealings of corrupt banks make sense the less it does. Another key thing is that our main characters goals are to profit from the impending doom of the economy and though a few moments are supposed to make us care about them we really don't. They still come off as amoral socially odd business men out to make bank so why do we care? We don't. The attempts at hip comedy fail and are distracting--characters suddenly talking to the camera--directly to the audience, celebrity cameos trying to explain what's going on. These are just distractions. I guess they wanted an almost Michael Moore type vibe but in a more fictional type presentation. It's especially frantic on the big screen almost headache inducing during some of the 20 sec flash cut montage scenes that keep popping up. It's great the director wanted to go for a "real" movie, that he doesn't succeed is too bad. A for effort as they say does not mean he gets an A.Good...but best to be watched with an economics professor. "The Big Short" is a good film but also a film that would be tough for the average viewer to enjoy and understand. This is because although the housing bubble's burst was a mess and destroyed a lot of peoples' lives, few folks really understand it. Sure, folks know that the banks were foolish as were home buyers (since they couldn't possibly afford these homes)....but that's about as far as their understanding goes. And, with the film tossing around all sorts of insider jargon, it's sure to confuse more than entertain.  What I would LOVE to see is a pop-up video version of the film with explanatory text appearing on the screen throughout the movie to further clarify what is happening. I've seen several Japanese import films like this--and they helped to explain cultural references that most non-Japanese viewers would miss.  The bottom line is that I am extremely well educated compared to the average person and yet I sometimes felt a bit lost. Enjoyable but best watched with an economics professor sitting in the room to explain it all in detail.Embarrassingly Inaccurate A vapid, preachy and historically false movie that is based upon fiction that the uneducated and uninformed will obediently lap up.  The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 added thousand upon thousands of pages of regulations that forced banks to lend money to low-income areas. Yes, forced.  This is the typical liberal prescription for all the ailments of society: Throw logic and reason out the window, and use a warm and fuzzy touchy-feeling legislation to try to fix an imagined injustice.  The Federal government (through the FDIC and FFIEC) required banks and mortgage companies to advertise and make super-low mortgage loans to people who should not have been buying a house in the first place.  If the banks refused to take on these dangerous loans, they risked steep fines, being audited, and even being taken over by the government while that particular bank was being given (yes, given) to another bank in the area.  So what did banks do? They made loans to everyone. What did that do? Made house prices SOAR. Which did what? Turned a $50,000 house into a $150,000 house. Now you have a family, who barely had any money to being with, trying to pay a $1,000 mortgage when their total income was maybe twice that. Their home gets re-assessed by the government, then their property taxes skyrocket.  Why? Because the leftists and liberals said 'everyone deserves the right to own a home'. People began defaulting on loans. Missing payments. Houses were repossessed. The market crashed.It Was OK I Guess Not really an accurate portrayal of the housing bust. The movie makes it out like these few people were the only ones who knew there was a problem brewing. Uh, no, zillions of people knew as early as 2004, including me, and I'm no Einstein. What set these guys apart is that they figured out a good way to profit from the coming collapse, although it was never made exactly clear just what sort of percentage return they made. The Michael Burry character was portrayed as an annoying mental case which seemed wrong to me since I've seen videos of the guy giving various speeches and he never struck me as a nutjob except in this movie. Didn't care for the bimbo in the bathtub explaining financial jargon to the viewers. Very contrived. No laying of any blame on the people who bought houses they couldn't afford. A lot of those people were closer to idiots than victims. The victim was ME, I bailed all you dumbasses out and you'd better believe it ain't over yet! Round 2 coming up.A thorough analysis of the 2008 financial collapse with an oxymoronic title One would think that in the absolute least it would be extremely difficult to make an intriguing movie about the housing market and the US banking system and the greedy people who invest and gamble with our country's future... while keeping a cyber-age audience entertained, but The Big Short not only manages to accomplish that goal but does it excellently. The major drawback to this film is that the pace is too fast for an average viewer to sort out who's who from a host of actors, each of whom portrays a key player in a complex intertwined financial system. That being said, this film targets the painful nerve of every American, a nerve that careens through their job security, affecting their monetary value and terminates in the core of their family's welfare: the place they cherish and call their home, for every man's home is his "castle" and whoever messes with a man's castle, is messing with the man's family. The repressed anger of the American people over the 2008 crises and the memories of the financial loss they have endured will be inflated as they watch this film and then "pricked" by the irritating, aggravating and infuriating outcome. Those who plan to watch it should plan on watching it twice and plan to clench a lead bullet between the back teeth.Well told true story As a person who understands how this housing bubble burst (not affected personally) - this is a well told story. The acting is great - the inserts of a chef explaining things, and a pop star - very interesting tactic. The individual characters are all well acted and developed. Many people do not get that the banks play games with the average person - as it says at the end of the movie - they just use different words for their products. The main focus of the bank is to make money - not help the consumer and this was rampant in the 90's. People need a place to live - do not put down your income-or lack of. Leave some of the questions blank - no one will care by the time it gets passed off and passed off and passed off and approved. ARM's - to me an automatic money maker for the mortgage holder and not the homeowner - oh that is right the mortgage holder owns the home. This is a movie that more people should see - the acting is great - the story is told well and all need to watch what happens in the future.The Big Mess Okay. So why is 'The Big Short' an average film? It's messy. Tonally, it's all over the place, featuring inconsistent uses of fourth wall breaks, random advertisements and clips scattered throughout, and sitting up in the director's chair, we have Adam McKay. The director of Anchorman (along with many other Ferrell-starring comedy vehicles), was not the right man to tell this story. Don't get me wrong, the subject matter is very interesting and necessary, adapted from the 2010 book of the same name which focuses on the financial crisis that hit in '07; but with such an important story to tell, was McKay the right man for the job? I'll let you decide. Unfortunately, I feel though his vision is scattered and the final product is rather uneven. The Best Director Oscar nomination is certainly surprising. It's the inconsistencies and lack of attention to the small details that bothered me. The film has an excellent soundtrack, in terms of song choices, but the way 50% of the songs are used, feels very poorly applied. Jarring cuts, odd mixing levels, etc. The same goes for the fourth wall breaks. We meet Jared Vennett (played by Ryan Gosling, who is excellent here) within the first few moments of the film, who essentially introduces the subject matter to us. It's okay, I can buy that, it's sort of reminiscent of Leo's discussions with the camera in The Wolf of Wall Street. But the fourth wall breaks that feel totally out of place, were (to name a few) the cut to Margot Robbie in the bubble bath, Selena Gomez gambling, even the ones between various supporting cast members. It took me out of the film for sure, I don't know about you. Gosling does get the most frequent asides though, which I was okay with. He certainly has a Leo-esque style about him. So, it's 2005. Bare foot, shorts sporting Dr. Mike Burry (Christian Bale) has realised that the American housing market is very unstable, as it's built upon subprime loans that are providing fewer returns. In the film's terms, the market is built upon a bubble that he predicts will 'burst' within the next couple of years. Burry decides to bet against the housing market, creating a credit default swap (CDS) market which the banks gleefully accept, since they genuinely believe that there's no way in hell that the collapse will occur. It's Burry's actions that are the catalyst for those of the film's other major players. Vennett, previously mentioned above, hears of Burry's unusual actions and comes to the realisation that he is absolutely right. The market is becoming increasingly unstable and so as Vennett jumps on board Burry's train of thought, Mark Baum (Steve Carrell) by accident hears of his actions and... yeah, you're getting the picture. Baum joins Vennett, hoping to profit from the CDS's as the result of the economy's collapse. Other players include young na√Øve investors Charlie and Jamie (John Magaro and Finn Wittrock), who come across one of Vennett's papers; and Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) a retired banker, and old friend of Jamie's, who is one of the few figures who have a genuine fear concerning the losses of jobs and homes as a result of the eminent bubble burst. I'll say it again, the information is important, the subject matter is brilliant, but at times, the way McKay and Randolph's screenplay "dumbs-things-down" for it's audience is totally ridiculous. And even then, watching a nude bathing Margot Robbie is enough to completely distract so you don't know what the hell she's talking about. Other points in the film throw so much financial jargon at you, it's hard to keep up, unless you go home from the cinema and try to google everything before you forget what you heard. If you can completely understand the concept of CDO's (basically "re-packaged poor loans"), after one viewing of this film, then I take my hat off to you. This review makes it sound like I hated the film, I realise that, but there is a lot to like here. Gosling's performance (and in particular the workplace bathroom scene) deserves praise. The honest human empathy and fear of the future reality expressed by Pitt certainly restored my faith in what seemed to be a world of greed and ease associated with turning a blind eye. Rickert states "If we're right, people lose homes. People lose jobs. People lose retirement savings, people lose pensions. You know what I hate about f_cking banking? It reduces people to numbers. Here's a number - every 1% unemployment goes up, 40,000 people die, did you know that?". But I can't seem to shake how disjointed the whole film is. The poor music cuts, the uneven direction, the (overrated) dodgy editing; I genuinely wish I liked it more than I did, because it's got the appeal, but sadly, falls short on both style and occasionally, substance.A Joke with a Serious Crisis In the end of 2007, the world saw one of the greatest crisis in the United States of America, the real estate bubble that affected and devastated the American economy.  "The Big Short" is a comedy that plays with the housing mortgage fraud of the bank and some of the players that foresaw the housing bubble and started hedge funds to make money. The screenplay is confused for those that are not familiar with details of the financial concepts and investments. The cameo appearance of personalities explaining concepts does not work well. My vote is five. Title (Brazil): "A Grande Aposta" ("The Big Bet")Best Film of the Year An absolutely brilliant adaptation of Michael Lewis' novel. I can't say enough about this film. I've watched it countless times and I still get something from it each time. The script, the cinematography, the casting - all brilliant. Steve Carell is superb as Mark Baum and Christian Bale is at the top of his game. He's never been better. Adam McKay has crafted a masterpiece for the ages. He clearly possesses a brilliant mind. What astonishes me is that he wastes his considerable talents on dreck like "Anchorman" and "Talladega Nights" and "Step Brothers." Why? I mean, WHY?!?!?! It just don't add up! The man should stick to smart and insightful films like "The Big Short" and leave the juvenile, unfunny comedies to Kevin Smith and Seth Rogan.Left wing opinion masquerading as fact Some good acting (I especially like Bale) and interesting tricks like having actors talk to the audience and having celebrities explain complex financial deals. Unfortunately it distorts reality to match a Leftist viewpoint, and repeats ad nauseam how evil bankers are. Conveniently left out is the pressure the government put on banks. Check out the history of the Community Reinvestment Act, particularly Bill Clinton's "coup de whiskey" which forced banks to accept junk housing loans. This is why such a large percentage of mortgages failed. This was NOT mentioned in the film; how can this not be relevant? Also, it was well known that housing loans were in trouble before the crash. I remember a cover article in The Economist predicting disaster in housing around 2005. I think the bankers were thinking, yeah, it's crazy, but the government is forcing us to do it so they are going to cover these loans in the end so they are secure. At least with Michael Moore you know he is lying to you; with this movie a lot of people accept it as fact.Well made Even though it's overused, I loved the self-conscious style of the story. Financial terms that are difficult to understand for the laymen are explained by people that have nothing to do with finance. This isn't cute or funny the way it sounds, it's satirical and sad because of how absurd the whole thing was. Combined with wonderful performances, by Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, the story becomes enjoyable and not as boring as the film admits the story to be in the beginning. On the other hand, I couldn't help but feel that the film was emotionally inconsistent. I am not suggesting that films of this nature should be balanced. Sure, there's always drama in satire but the dramatic scenes of the film were not enough to warrant themselves in respect with the whole. There should have been better management of these scenes so that either they are balanced, or they are so imbalanced that they become more than they seem. I haven't read the book, but the film is well-made and worth a watch.Great film - energetic and interesting Based on the true story of how the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) came about from 2005-2008, 'The Big Short' tells the story really well by mixing humour, facts (delivered in an unconventional way by celebrities) and following four tenuously-linked groups who have skin in the game. Vennett (Gosling) introduces us at the start of 2005, via a unique fourth-wall-breaking monologue, placing the players on the field - I'm using this terminology, as most of the film (and Wall Street in general) can be likened to gambling. It may sound boring on the surface - a film about banking and finance - but it does a great job of explaining the terminology in simple terms, whilst not being condescending about it. The groups involved are Burry (Bale), a fund manager and prodigy of sorts, who first sees the housing bubble and notices that the big banks have been over-valuing mortgages (sub-prime). Baum (Carell) and his small company are offered the opportunity to "short" the banks' mortgages by Vennett. Geller (Magaro) &amp; Shipley (Wittrock), two young entrepreneurs, who seek help from their mentor, retired Wall St mogul Rickert (Pitt) also pick up on what' happening and get in on the action. It's great to see the banks gleefully taking their money, being so cocky and greedy, only to have it all blow up in their faces two years later. I think Carell, not Bale, should have been Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor! Baum serves as the film's moral centre and calls everyone on their fraudulent behaviour. The film almost acts as a documentary when it delves down to the individual family level and makes you truly realise how little these large corporations care for other humans. The most bittersweet part is the ending - "and then the crooks went to jail, Congress brought in reform and the fraudulent system was overhauled - just joking! They didn't go to jail, Congress was lobbied so no reform was passed and the big banks were bailed out by the taxpayers" - funny, sad, and true. Really makes you think, but is also a well-made film with excellent acting.Movie is too profound to be entertaining Humorous and funny? NOT !! I didn't laugh once. I only got a C in Economics and all the terminology of selling "short", CDOs and other code words, made for a dull 130 minutes. Only Steve Carell comes off as a moral, person with a conscience, worried about the bank collapse consequences. Christian Bale's character is outstandingly perceptive, while Gosling and the two from Boulder are out to get rich and they do. This tells a story similar to Wall Street and Wolf of Wall Street,but too technical to care. Obviously people got screwed,but as a movie,it makes me indifferent.Short changed... A complicated story navigated by some good actors, with the requisite Hollywood handwringing thrown in, at the end... This is a very contemporary topic that deserved to be explored in a cinematic sense... but I'm sorry, I just can't make myself care about the minutiae, no matter how hard I try... If you're au fait with the financial landscape, it's an impressive and engaging watch, though!A more suitable title would have been 'The Big Stinker'. Originally reviewed: (26/12/2016) The Big Short tries to be both Oliver Stone's Wall Street and Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street at the same time but fails miserably. The Film apparently stars four bankers but the screen time for each of them is divided poorly as Steve Carell has the most scenes in the picture. This is a problem as personally I found Christian Bale's character a lot more interesting and curious than anyone else within the picture. Ryan Gosling is extremely Narcissistic and unlikeable and Brad Pitt has no right being on the front cover, as there are plenty of other less known actors that have a lot more screen time than him. Furthermore there are two awful pointless cameos involving Margot Robbie and the utterly talentless Selena Gomez. If this is a comedy then why is it so hauntingly boring and void of humour, okay so they have a couple of chuckles early on but this picture goes on for 2 hours and feels like eternity, it's just nonstop dialogue with actors going through the motions in a so-so story that will be forgotten within a week of having watched it. The Big Short is nothing more than shameless dreary Oscar bait.A White Supremacy Film The movie itself is good, that I have to say. However, in the choice of actors, the file it is full of stereotype: 1. Minorities and female roles are simply silly or greedy as depicted by this film. Especially, all three Asian role are negative, either greedy or dumb.  2. All smart guys that see through the shorts are white male.  3. No white female are positive either.  4. Most of the people in the film that are not white male simply accept the living under the fraud and dare not to doubt it. Only white males are "courageous and smart" enough to make a difference. Conclusion: I cannot say the deception is intentional, however, it is so stereotyped and misleading.Ruined the ending . . . Was a little tough to follow because there were so many different people/entities involved. I'm sure if I saw it again, it would be more clear. Was thoroughly enjoying the movie until they got political at the very end. I won't spoil it for anyone, but they said something about immigration that offended me. When the movie was over, I couldn't help but taste the political remarks they dropped at the end of the movie.  Hollywood seems to have forgotten that we watch movies for entertainment. Even if we have wonderful fulfilling lives already, we want to vicariously experience something else when we watch movies. I was enjoying the movie until Hollywood took a dump in my living room.Economics as a confusing way of the world **** May contain strong spoilers **** This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading.... This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world. A genuine solid movie about economics. A story that has a lot to say both in the perspective of it being an authentic story, and also about how the world is fictionalized to create scenarios of the financial worlds. Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Solid. Very good. - The actors : A movie that gained attention in the Academy Award world. Says it all. - Entertainment : If you like an drama with a true story behind and the almost confusing world of economics; yes. - Age : 15 7,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)Big on Fantasy &amp; Fiction, Short on Fact and Accuracy I do have concerns about this genre of film; portraying real events in film is always a difficult proposition, when the makers want to try to make it entertaining this is where the conflicts between truth and fact become at odds with the entertainment (film) industry. The subject matter is far too complex to cram one story in 2 hours, it would just do the facts no justice at all. To try to run three concurrent stories makes for short on fact and big on spin. With this in mind the film seems to have no identity; It isn't a fact based drama, the actors' quips to camera make it appear like a light hearted thriller ‚Äì which it is neither. What it is is an interesting watch to wile away 2 hours, but that is it. The performance of Christian Bale was awful, not for one moment did I ever feel that the character was real, his mannerisms in trying to portray Dr. Burry's afflictions were amateur at best and way over the top as to be irritating, every time he stuttered, stammered or pulled a strange face the irritation clicked up another notch. This was one of Christian Bale's worst performances on screen. Steve Carrel should stick to what he does best; comic acting where an OTT performance can add to the film not detract from it; his fixed chaotic hair style just about as irritating as Christian Bales acting, just about...Brad Pitt's performance was also pretty dire, caught between (and failing on both counts) trying to be a Robert Redford look-a-like and neo hippy off grid ex-banker was wasteful of his talents, he should be doing better than a poor cameo role.THE most informative film I have ever seen. By far THE most informative film I have ever seen which offered a highly detailed look at the worst financial meltdown in over 3/4 of a century. This film is a one of a kind for me, never have I ever paid so much attention to the information given out by a film to the point where I'm taking notes and pausing to reflect on what it all means.  This all coming from a topic in which I had only a passing interest in discovering what exactly happened but throughout the course of this film the passing interest turned into a burning desire to figure out the whole story and enrich myself with new knowledge.  The information was given in such a gentle and flowing way that you were thoroughly enjoying finding out new words and phrases used in the financial circle many of which were handed out with the subtlety of Lehman's terms in a jocular way such as Margot Robbie laying naked in a bath while telling you the finer points of bonds and subprime mortgages. The fluidity in which the story moves along with the information makes you feel blessed in what you've learned and once you've figured out the exact cause and order of the collapse you feel like an all powerful knowledge robot.  I think this film will undoubtedly divide opinion because the manner in which it must be viewed to consume every last drop of information is vital, for example you hardly want to watch this film at a cinema where you have no chance to pause and reflect and figure out what's going on because the film is already powering forward. Overall I would have to say this film feels likes a once in a lifetime watch where you take a subject that only slightly interested me and somehow through genius and to a degree a certain amount of showbiz glitz make me thoroughly obsessed with figuring it all out and seeing the picture that the puzzle pieces formed.  A sheer work of art by the writers, directors and by a AAA rated cast, and rest assured my rating system isn't fraudulent.Excuse me who liked the movie , but I found it very boring The Big Short in my opinion is the worst movie of the nominees in Oscar, found a boring movie with slow pace and moments trying to be funny more does not work ( at least for me ) , the cast is a strong point of the film, Christian Bale , Steve Carell , Ryan Gosling , Brad Pitt , John Magaro , Karen Gilian , Melissa Leo , Marisa Tomei, and have a rapid participation of Selena Gomes and other Margot Robbie that and Fri and very good, the direction of Adam McKay reasonable , I found very similar film with the Wolf Wall Street, the script is good, the Big Short in my opinion not work in humor, the performances are even good , plus the pace and slow, the movie is kind of boring with time and dull and unnecessary , besides being much like the Wolf Wall Street (which is very good) , plus the script of the film is even good, plus my view Adam McKay could not use well the good script had. Note 5.6Adam McKay makes a great financial comedy crisis film. THE BIG SHORT IS BIG ON STORY, BIG ON MONEY, BIG ON PERFORMANCES, and BIG ENTERTAINMENT! (From what I can understand about it) The Big Short is the dramatic true story of the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis revealing the global market collapse through the eyes of those who saw it coming and figured out ways to profit from it. We also get an inside look into the world of money, greed, Wall Street, business, chaos, corruption and outcast. The films main cast includes, Christian Bale (The Dark Knight Trilogy, American Psycho), Ryan Gosling (Drive, The Nice Guys), Steve Carell (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Seeking a Friend For the End of the World), and Brad Pitt (Fight Club, 12 Years a Slave). The Big Short is directed by Adam McKay (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Step Brothers). Adam McKay may not be the first guy you think of to direct a project like The Big Short. On the other hand, McKay directs a good flick, and brings a nice financial comedy crisis film (is that a thing?) to the public. BATMAN AND BRICK TAMLAND Talking' MONEY?! For starters, the cast is amazing! Everyone truly does give it their all. Especially Christian Bale and Steve Carell. It was nice to see Steve Carell play a character that isn't similar to Brick Tamland. Between this and Fox catcher, Steve Carell is really becoming one of my favorite serious toned actors, who can really transform themselves in a way we haven't seen. There's something about a angry Steve Carell that makes great entertainment. (Brick Tamland ‚Äì "I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE YELLING ABOUT!") Now for me, this film was a little confusing at time. However, Adam McKay does a good job of simplifying it for the general audience, and makes us care about something most people find confusing or have little interest in. It's not that I don't care for banking, and how this seriously affected people. It's just the movie is a little lengthy, and it's a ton of numbers, credits, smart people talking, and words that made me pause the movie to look up the definition (man I must sound like an idiot). They even have celebrity cameos to help people like me to understand. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but a popular Australian beauty shows up drinking champagne while sitting in bubble bath, to explain what is going on at that moment. (I hardly understood, but man I wanted to get in on that bubble bath and champagne!) One thing I really enjoyed were when the characters break the fourth wall to address the viewer(s). It was funny, well written, and once again, made the plot of the movie easier to follow. In my opinion, the direction, writing, characters, and style really work.  So these are my final *Bleeping* Buddha thoughts on The Big Short. It's a good movie, it's educational, with exceptional performances, techniques, and something worth seeing. This film may not be for everyone, but the performances, writing, and drama are the real show stealers. Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling's characters are there really to explain things. I would have liked to see more depth to their characters. As Brick Tamland said, "I like lamp.", and I like this movie. I believe The Big Short earns a¬Ö 7/10 This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading and or viewing, and I hope you have an amazing day as always.overly simplistic black comedy fun! My mother is a loan officer and last night we were flipping through Netflix for a movie to watch. I was happy to see this film there (Netflix takes forever with some films) and was glad to see it with my mom because for once, if i didn't understand a film, she could explain it to me instead of vice versa. Thankfully it was a simple enough narrative i didn't need to ask too many questions. She felt the film was mostly accurate but a bit one sided. too much emphasis is put on the 'big bad banks' and not enough on the irresponsibility of the average joe in that time. two scenes in particular explain this: (SPOILERS) the scene with the stripper where she explains she has about eight houses, all bought with loans, and the scene in Florida where they to go to collect from that guy, only to find out it's his landlord in trouble who has fled. those are probably two of the biggest reasons we got in such deep crap. People buying things with the money they do not have. It is not the greed of banks, it is the greed and manipulation of the system BY THE PEOPLE. My mother is Mexican, and speaks fluent Spanish, so she would get all the 'problematic loans'. what does that mean? she'd get the loans from immigrant people who claimed to have no money. Only, once she started to investigate, she'd find they were paid in cash, under the table, sent that money home, claimed they were poor and qualified for everything social under the son. even the wife of OUR GARDENER said she was single so her kids would qualify for wellbabies and whatever else insurance and perks her kids got at school. so while I applaud the filmmakers for taking such a serious subject and turning it into something more people wanna watch (because this film SHOULD be watched) I wish they hadn't taken such a left approach and been more neutral. a lot to ask from Hollywood, i guess. other than that, fun fantastic cast that gave the film a great energy, the element of breaking the 4th wall always brings in the laughs among the other black comedy in the film. a generally enjoyable film, even if i eventually felt it ran too long.Great acting with a confusing concept. 4/10 Review: I really had high hopes for this movie, mainly because of the brilliant cast but I didn't know what the hell was going on most of the time and the Wall Street jargon, became way too technical for me. There was too many characters that were doing different things and I personally think that it became a bit messy after a while. I deliberately didn't want to know anything about the plot before I watched it but if I knew that it was based around the property crash during 2008, I definitely would have watched it with someone else so they could explain to me what was going on. Out of all of the top stars in this film, Steve Carell and the brash Ryan Gosling, were brilliant but it would have helped if I knew what the hell they were talking about. Don't get me wrong, I get the main concept of the movie and I knew who was good and who was bad but if your not from that world, I really don't know how your supposed to understand there various phrases and different methods of tricking the market to make billions of dollars. Brad Pitt and Christian Bale also put in good performances and they played there roles convincingly but I still was confused most of the time. Basically, it's worth a watch, just for the performances but from an entertainment point of view, it really didn't do it for me. Disappointing but watchable. Round-Up: With such an enormous cast, the box office takings were pretty disappointing, and I'm sure that a lot of the money was made after getting nominated for a few Oscars. It did win in the Best Writing category, even though I found it quite confusing but it lost out to Spotlight in the Best Movie category. I can understand why this movie is so appealing, because it explains how the stock market crashed and how so many people lost there homes and jobs, so it is a significant movie for this time and age but they will have to release The Big Short for dummies for me to get it. It was written and directed by Adam McKay, 48, who also brought you Anchorman 1 &amp; 2, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers and The Other Guys, so this film was definitely a change of genre for a director who had primarily made movies for the comedy market. The script was slightly witty and I liked the way that Ryan Gosling was narrating through the film, which gave it a lighter feel, even though it was dealing with a delicate moment in time. I still would have to watch it again to fully understand it and I'm sure that I'm not alone when it came to the confusing technical jargon.¬† Budget: $28million Worldwide Gross: $133.3million I recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/drama/comedies starring Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt,¬†Marisa Tomei, Hunter Burke, Rudy Eisenzopf, Casey Groves, Charlie Talbert, Shauna Rappold, Brandon Stacy, Peter Epstein, Melissa Leo and Anthony Marble. 4/10A film about bankers "The Big Short" is a film with Steve Carell and some other folks about things in the banking industry that lead to the 2008 recession. Various banking guys discover issues in the industry that could lead to a potential market collapse. At the least, they uncover fraudulent and deceptive practices. A lot of the movie seems to be scenes in which hotshots from Bank A with knowledge about problematic mortgages visit bigwigs from Bank B hoping to cash in or learn more about the problem by shielding themselves from sharing the ultimate issue at hand. "You mean you don't do income verification when giving people mortgages?" "No, we don't." And more questions from the Bank A people follow. Never a desire to set such people straight and tell them that people's jobs and lives are at stake, never a desire to wonder if their participation in the banking industry itself should be questioned. Steve Carell's character, always looking to point out and draw out the problem and bringing attention to it without providing a path forward to how to tighten up this practice and prevent it form happening in the future. Sorry, can't identify. Part of the film seems to be a crusade against "big banking capitalists" by noting that the poor and working class will be affected by these sketchy mortgage deals, but then by the end of the movie the main characters appear to cash in themselves on such an industry. You uncovered the problem, brilliant, but then don't have either the moral fortitude or wherewithal about how to lead things forward to a stronger future. I guess, that is, because you are simply bankers. Features a rather strange performance by Christian Bale.the end of capitalism? Was Karl Marx right with his critics and analysis about the capitalist system, its crisis, and inequalities? The question must have crossed the minds of many people faced with the periodic failures of the world economy and financial systems in the last couple of decades, which seem to have made the poor poorer, ruined into poverty millions of people who were part of the middle class, while making many of the rich richer. The question is asked indirectly also by the makers of 'The Big Short' directed by Adam McKay, probably the best film made until now about the crush of the real-estate market followed by the financial system which started in 2007, and to some extent continues until today. The housing market in the United States was expanding and seemed to be rocky solid in the 1990s and the early 2000s. It was supported by a banking system which did not only provided the credits that allowed all the strata of the population reach the house of their dreams, but also created new money from money and profits from profits for the investors. This kind of bubble BTW persists until today and endangers all the capitalist economy. The film describes how a few people involved with the investment funds and banking systems had foreseen the fall ('The Big Short') and made a profit out of it investing in credit default swaps, kind of insurance policies against the deficit of a system which was supposed never to fail. If you want this was like buying insurance policies against earthquakes with the confidence that an earthquake will happen in the next two years in one of the most stable areas in the world. Director McKay took a documentary book (Michael Lewis' "The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,") and turned it into docu-fiction of the best quality. In order to explain how the system worked he used the narrator who is also one of the heroes (played by Ryan Gosling) and a few real life celebrities to explain the dry financial terms. I certainly did not become an expert in economics after seeing this film, but I can understand what chef Antoine Bourdelle means with taking lower quality ('B rated') sea-food and putting it in his bouillabaisse, package with his 'AAA rated' prestige. The smart heroes take life each on screen thanks to well written dialogues and fine performances of such actors as Gosling, Christian Bale, Steve Carell, or Brad Pitt. 'The Big Short' proves that the financial and banking system that is supposed to support the capitalist economy is ill. It also proves that Hollywood at its best can make relevant movies that touch real life, while being good entertainment for smart viewers. In what concerns the question 'was Karl Marx right?' the answer is in my opinion that he was right in part of the analysis of the capitalist system, but was completely wrong in what concerns the cure. If a cure exists for the capitalist system, its name is certainly not communism.Getting the short end Although many would argue the end is not in sight. Not for a long time it won't be. Especially if nothing changes in America concerning politics. But that would be stretching it now. The movie just makes it even more important to know what you vote and why you vote for it. What happened in America (and what is surely still happening to at least a degree) caused an earthquake which rippled all over the world. Financial crisis still roaming in some countries. Not that those countries didn't "help" by making bad choices themselves too. But it's amazing what banks are still allowed to do and how they won't ever will be made responsible for their mistakes (unless a politician finally steps up and makes them - of course that man or woman would have to be elected president first). But back to this movie, with its weird mix of comedy and cold hard facts. It's tough to laugh at times and it's tough to understand the whole picture too. Which is why we get interludes with famous people playing themselves, explaining important plot points (or rather real life incidents/information) for the viewer to be able to actually get behind it all. The fourth wall is broken a lot, the movie tells us the whole time what is up. It's also telling is from time to time, that events didn't exactly occurred as presented, making fun of the process itself. It might be too clever for its own good, or at least in the perception of some viewing, who might have preferred a more straight/head-on approach. But if you dig what they did here, you'll get an excellent movie nonetheless"The system is ran by stupidity..." The truest truth I've heard in a movie. Presented to the audience with a mixture of award winning performances, fourth-wall breaking narration, and snippets of documentary type photos, this true story breaks down the limits Hollywood seems to usually put on itself and lets the truth ring like the Stock Market's closing bell.  Summary: Because I'm one of the simple folk that this movie talks down to in a playful, I can't accurately summarize the movie except to say that some people see the housing market bubble before anyone else, and decided to gamble against the housing market to make money. I've enjoyed this movie so much, I'm writing the review before I even finish it, so you don't have to worry about spoilers.  As a simple folk myself, who happens to work in an organization in which I can truly see stupidity marching in front of the pack in the most self-assured way as it leads its way right on into proverbial hell, I can honestly say that this movie makes an artful and accurate representation of what happens when greed is allowed to breed within society, and within those who hold the 1% of the nation's wealth. But the movie is not a statement on which political party should accept fault for the housing market bubble bursting. Instead it simply looks at the big name banks that were either too shady or too stupid to see the bubble themselves and do something to prevent millions of Americans from being forced from their homes and fired from jobs. This isn't the kind of drama that has weepy tears and over the top scenes of intense passion... although you might be able to count the snippets of cynicism and anger, or maybe the confusion and excitement. I don't count it, because the information and dialogue thrown at you at a pace that makes random numbers and technical jargon sound so cool and exciting that the emotions and feelings come second to the full force of how so many people could be blinded to one simple truth. That is, until the very end, when the "heroes" of the film realize that even if they get a 20 to 1 or 200 to 1 return on their investments, they're winning at the expense of those millions of Americans. That weight is palpable as it comes crashing through each scene, "the housing market is built on lies and deceit."  The movie should be watched by every young adult to explain how a mindless, self-absorbed approach to life can lead to far-reaching, terrible, consequences. It's theme that I find most appealing, and the is that apathy that comes as a consequence of self preservation may usually seem like a low risk decision, but it is in fact an investment into a hollow way of life that will simply collapse under the weight of its massive fallibility.A movie about how it all went down - mortgages, banks, investors and people. The thing about most scams is that the schemers usually get away with it (well some might land up in jail after making tonnes of money). Its the people they have conned that suffer - and these people are everyday people like you and me. This is exactly what happen during the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Banks, investors, funds managers, and people remotely connected to the financial world - all made money. Except the people on whose name the mortgages were on. What is it about The Big Short based on a book by Michael Lewis (The blind side, Moneyball fame), is a good movie - its not great and I will tell you why in a bit. But lets start with the good stuff. It has big names who acted pretty well - Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt and Christian Bale. The characters they portrayed are all real people and that's what made it interesting. Christian Bale is Dr. Michael Burry, the man who predicted it all. As early as 2005, he knew the Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), the instruments with which bankers were making loads of money already, were made even more lucrative with sub-prime mortgages filled in them. His prediction and solution to make money for his investors is one story. The other parallel story is of Steve Carell - again a fund manager working for Morgon Stanley. He is angry and by moving back and forth during the movie they tell you why. His story is about his dilemma - of looking for a loophole in the system but hoping against hope that there is no fraud. The third parallel story is about 2 new fund managers, kids in the big bad world of finance, who have made good money already by picking the right stocks for their investors but chance upon the sub-prime crisis pretty early on and take the help of Brad Pitt to short the MBS. The street-smart, suave Ryan Gosling is the one who kind of stitches all three parallel stories together in his own cool ways. He is in it to make money as well but not at the forefront. Why it didn't work (for me) It's a complex plot, people with no understanding of the sub-prime crisis will find it really difficult to follow this movie and that is why Adam McKay, the director has tried to provide bite sized finance lessons with the help of famous people like Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain, Selena Gomez etc. But I don't think it will help people who just want easy movies where you don't have to follow each and every dialogue. That's where the movie lost out for me. The big short is convoluted, its difficult to follow because it keeps zipping through multiple stories and characters (I personally like this style but for such an intricate movie, this didn't work). Though all the actors have done their bits well, it feels almost clinical - it didn't bring out the emotions that it should have - the grossness of it all, the pathetic situation of people like you and me or anger that not many people who were responsible for the crisis went to prison. Maybe that's what the movie is about, the smugness of all the people who did what they did by cheating normal people and didn't give a dime about people who lost their houses and jobs. Why you should still watch it Watch it to understand a bit about the crisis - after all its part of history, something that happened and affected millions of people around the world. Also watch it for Steve Carell. I usually don't like his antiques and comic sense, but he has done a brilliant job in this one - his shock of finding it all out, perplexity of what one should do in position of power and his really emotional outburst is a joy to watch. I forgive him for all the crappy movies he ever did. :) I give The Big Short a C+. Did you think it was better than what I thought of it?A Different Look at the Housing Crisis of 2008 Based on the same housing economic meltdown in 2008, The Big Short covers the story from the different viewpoint of a few who saw it coming. Michael Burry (Christian Bale), was a physician and hedge fund manager, creator of Scion Capital LLC. He was the first to recognize the impending doom of the careless practices by financial institutions and bet heavy on the housing market bubble to burst in a big way. He was so confident in his analysis that he used $1 Billion of his investors money. Some of his investors were more than displeased and pulled out in 2006 and 2007. When the market crashed in 2008, Burry profited $100 million for himself and another $700 for his remaining investors. He was quoted as saying, "I don't go out looking for good shorts. I'm spending my time looking for good longs." Banker Jared Vennett (Ryan Gossling) and another hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell) caught wind of what Burry was up to and jumped in as well. Some young investors accidentally discovered what Vennett was up to and talked Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), an ex stocks trader, into taking part.  The Big Short was nominated for Best Picture of the Year and Bale was nominated for his supporting role. It won for Best Adapted Screenplay. The preview looks to be a stinging look at the corporate greed that rocked the world with a bit of humor as a small group forms a bit of a financial coup. However, the humor is either going to be one of those "it's funnier because it's true" situations, or it will illicit a sort of "ha-ha-ouch" at just how crippling their ignorance and greed was, and still remains today. I anticipated rating this 3.5 stars. Throughout the movie, I dropped down to 2.5, but raised it up to a final verdict of 3.0 stars. It's entertaining, well-acted, but sometimes hard to follow. What helped me raise it up was that the movie self-admits that it's own subject matter is boring and confusing. It takes breaks from the film in unique ways to help those of us not in the know what exactly is going on. I was still confused at parts during the film, but those moments of "banking for dummies" definitely helped. These breaks are done through an artistic method called "breaking the fourth wall". In theatre and in film, when you as an audience member are looking at a scene with 3 walls in a room, the fourth wall is assumed to be where the camera is positioned. You take it for granted that there is a fourth wall and don't think about the cameras and cables and directors and monitors, etc that are actually there. When an actor on stage acknowledges the audience by speaking directly to them, or in a movie when you are addressed by the actor breaking away from the movie, they are ultimately admitting that there is no fourth wall, that this is just a play or a movie and that there are people watching in one way or another. Gossling's character helps to drive the story much like a narrator in a Shakespearean play who introduces the plot with a prologue, has a couple recapping monologues and then sums it up with a prologue.  Unfortunately for The Big Short, if you watched any television at all or were on the internet or picked up a paper in late 2008, most of the things covered in the movie, we already knew. The banks started making more money off of mortgages by clumping them into bundles. They were secure with the best ratings meaning that there was almost no chance the mortgages wouldn't be paid back. The banks made a ton of money. Eventually, housing for the qualified homeowners started to dry up and the bonuses started to shrink. That's when they started lumping in some riskier mortgages in to the bundle. No one did background checks and the mortgages written were only for a short introductory period that would then balloon into 200 to 300 per cent of the original payback rate. When the introductory period ended and millions found they couldn't afford their payments, millions lost their homes and even more lost their jobs and the banks covered it all up. When the truth was finally discovered, it was too late and the US Government saw no other way to limit and reverse the damages than to shell out billions in taxpayer money to the banks. This money was used to then pay out big bonuses and only one person ever went to jail. And the banks are still doing it today, just with different names.  The Big Short was very well-acted, entertaining, confusing, upsetting, but seeing it once was enough for me. I might catch it on TV someday, but it won't be making it to my home collected, hence the 3.0 star rating.Noble effort comes up a bit, well, short The Big Short (TBS) is a moderately below-average film that stumbles in a couple basic areas. I found myself in the metaphorical shoes of stock analyst Michael Baum (Steve Carrell) who cannot believe he is watching a slow-motion train wreck no one else either understands or cares a whit about. I'm unsure many early glowing reviewers actually watched the film. One giveaway: TBS is saturated with irony mustier than an underground cavern, yet few deemed it worthy of comment. From the one-eyed hedge fund manager Michael Burry (Christian Bale) who sees what others cannot, to the compromised ratings agency woman whose vision is (literally) impaired, it's nearly endless. The alligator lurking in the backyard pool at the abandoned Florida development? Wait, is that a metaphor? There's meta-irony mixed in with their praise: TBS is largely about people who willfully overrated mortgage bonds and thereby misled others for personal gain. I wonder if some purposely overrated TBS for analogous reasons. Full disclosure: I've worked on Wall Street for 25 years, both as a humble accountant and an opinionated research analyst. I've seen virtually all major Wall-Street-related films of the past 25-30 years, most more than once. Like the old joke about "Caddyshack" and its sequel, "Wall Street" far and away is the best of the genre, and "Wall Street II" the worst. I admire Michael Lewis, and I read TBS at least twice. The director's main conceit, that people can't enjoy a movie about a financial scandal without regular distractions including naked lovelies taking bubble baths, celebrity chefs, and comely actresses playing themselves in cameos, was a BIG disappointment. Underestimating the audience downgraded the similarly stylish and well-cast "Margin Call," in my view, terminally afraid to explain exactly why the fictional bank was going belly-up. Examples abound where a film both informs about the world of finance and entertains without annoying asides and sophomoric time-outs: "Wall Street" let us in on the world of mergers and acquisitions, risk arbitrage, and insider trading, "Boiler Room" limned the high-pressure sales tactics of unscrupulous brokers who operate in, well, boiler rooms. "Wolf of Wall Street" channeled "Boiler Room", "Goodfellas", and a sand grain of "Wall Street" to illuminate the dangers of charismatic pied pipers pitching penny stocks to suckers. Plus it made much better use of Margot Robbie (Margot Robbie). Instead of drowning the audience in complex terminology like Credit Derivative Obligations (CDOs) and Credit Default Swaps (CDSs), why not just stick with "mortgage bonds" (MBs) and "put options?" TBS cries out for the technique Rob Lowe suggests in "Thank you for Smoking": just add a line of dialogue to quickly explain what a soon-to-be-forgotten financial product is used for. Then move on. Movies like "Wall Street" and books like "The Great Crash 1929" place financial bubbles squarely in the context of human nature: People will rampantly speculate on the value of stocks and/or real estate, their values will eventually inflate, and then ultimately the bubble will pop. Stocks. Real estate. Inflate. Pop. Rinse and repeat. I suppose TBS is about bonds and real estate. Whatever, it's not that new. Roughly 90% of every financial crisis boils down to one thing: Money is borrowed that won't be repaid. 1929 crash. 1980s S&amp;L crisis. 2007 sub-prime mortgages. Follow the borrower. The other 10% is the colorful detail movies are made of. In 2016, it'll be shale petroleum-based loans and junk bonds that blow up. Yawn. The cast is first-rate and production values uniformly high. Ryan Gosling was very good as Jared Vennett, the unicorn who both works for an I-bank yet comprehends the inherently unsustainable underpinnings of the MBs they create. His Jenga scene explaining how MBs are constructed was my favorite. Some scenes utterly lack accuracy. Burry visits Goldman Sachs to ask them to craft a brand-new, never-before-devised contract to make a huge bet against the US housing market. Two spiffy junior bankers across the table (whom I'll nickname Muffy and Sanjay) quickly agree to write the unique contract then and there. Umm, no way, Sanjay. Brand new derivatives with novel risks that require bank capital to be set aside might take several weeks to put together. Muffy and Sanjay need to successfully navigate at least a couple of Risk Committee approval processes, plus invest serious time with internal lawyers and an external regulatory agency for good measure. Ouch. Other times I confess no clue what the film wants to convey. The scene with two young Coloradans (TYCs) in the lobby of JP Morgan Chase is one example. If I understand, the TYCs first get summarily rejected, then stumble upon a pitch book left on a lobby bench (?) that outlines the entire short-the-sub-prime-market thesis. Then one TYC looks directly into the camera and informs us this scene never actually happened; they simply cadged the impending sub-prime crisis idea from a friend. Huh? I'm confused. You either take artistic license or you don't, but not both. There went the "Best Editing" Oscar. Most financial flicks are chock-full of memorable quotes. "Wall Street" alone could fill a small Kindle ("Greed is good", "Lock and load," "Blue Horseshoe loves Annacott Steel," "So the falcon has heard the falconer?" "American Express has got a hit-man looking for me," "The illusion has become real," "Because it's wreckable"). "Boiler Room" actually includes a worshipful paean to "Wall Street"'s quotability. There's nothing similarly memorable in TBS. In a screenplay cut from prime Michael Lewis-woven cloth, this in itself constitutes a financial-bubble-sized scandal. Final irony: By placing full blame upon the banks, the filmmakers actually may delude viewers about the risks of history repeating itself and the public's ultimate responsibility for their financial matters. They thereby render a recurrence of this sad chapter in our recent economic history more likely. A second bubble bath scene, with Barney Frank explaining his indispensable role in this whole mess, would be a teaching moment like none other.Good for Understanding OK, this bored me to tears. Did folks not know the crash was due to companies 'propping' the market? Anybody buy a house and offered twice as much as they wanted? I was. I told them I live within my means and bought a home accordingly. It is the story of 3 levels of folks who figure out the market early,later, and latest from my view. Not interesting. How did they do this? I read the news and know how they did this, the mortgage folks that is. A lot of over characterizations based on one person representation such as the scenes about the rating agency. This is a film for those not clueful about this and those who are woefully uninformed. I was bored. I did not find Bael's performance was interesting or enlightening in any way. Why is a geek investor noting the numbers interesting?On the spot from the first minute until the credits. I had no expectations for this movie, but I was enjoying every minute. Educational, funny and exiting, this movie is a 9.5. The best thing about this movie is that is shows how the economy is so f...ed up, in real life. The cast for this movie is spot on. Every one of the four main characters are casted perfect for the role. Bale and Bitt are lovely to watch as two awkward but genuine guys, and Carell and Gosling also make a perfect match in this movie. Carrel is delivering his best movie performance ever (along with Foxcatcher)! The story is very good, and during the movie you learn a lot of things about the economy and how its all put together, to confuse the average citizen. Watch this movie and you will have a good time and learn something in the same time. And... you will also, I hope, think about the mechanics of the economy before you put your signature on something in the future.The Vidiot Reviews... The Big Short The best part of homeownership in the early-2000s was if your house ever burnt down, you still had two left over. While no one saw this as a problem, the suits in this dramedy did¬Öand made millions. When rogue hedge fund manager Michael Burry (Christian Bale) uncovers what will eventually become the housing bubble, he predicts its eventual collapse and, despite ridicule from every bank he meets with, he bets against it. His credit default swap scheme ends up intriguing a trader (Ryan Gosling), an investor (Finn Wittrock), another hedge fund manager (Steve Carell) and an ex-banker (Brad Pitt), all of who want in. Clarifying the complexities of the financial crisis and defining the convoluted terminology involved with elucidatory side vignettes, this layperson adaptation of the non-fiction novel is frightening, facetious, and keenly insightful. Incidentally, with all those subsequent foreclosures, smart traders would've invested in cans of squatter spray.  Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.caWhen the bubble bursts... "When the bubble bursts..." What just happened to Hollywood? They finally got their strength to shout out the bitter truth about our society. Stories that were condemned as anti-capitalistic are now the new hot stuff. I was disappointed with last year's output of Hollywood. After Fury Road and Star Wars, there wasn't much for cheer, until the Oscar season came. Trumbo, Bridge of Spies and The Big Short are three movies that ventured to explore the ideas beyond blind loyalty to conventional political scenario. While Trumbo and Bridge of spies dealt with the past, The Big Short was a depressing analysis of 2008's financial meltdown of the united states construction industry. The funny part is, even with a steaming subject and a detailed, disturbing analysis, this movie is credited as a comedy! Ah, the way world works... While most of the terms discussed in this movie are strictly technical, like CDO, sub-prime, etc., I succeeded to grasp what was going on and it was a head-twister. Basically, it was the shortcut plan of the wall- street money makers to keep the capitalistic wheel running. When there wasn't enough oil to turn the wheel, it crashed. That is, people failed to pay their mortgages back and as they accumulated beyond the limit, the stocks got low and the wall-street crashed. Four individuals came to know about this years before it happened and The Big Short follows through their and their attempts to capitalize the fall. There are no good guys in this stories. Likewise, we can't blame them for doing so, because the fall was inevitable. This haplessness makes this movie quite realistic and relatable. It's a big surprise that Adam Macky directed this film. It was quite a translation from Anchormen to The Big Short. The cast was so alive. Christian Bale, Steve Carrel, Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling and many other relatively unknown yet brilliant actors make this movie a delightful yet insightful watch. After all said and done, The Big Short brings out many questions that will elude sleep for many. Still, I have no idea how could they label this movie as a comedy. Seriously...How is this movie not rated 10!!! How is this movie not rated 10!!! This is the only movie that explains thoroughly what happened.. with great actors and humor.. It drives me crazy how many people lost their jobs, homes, savings. And someone got 47 billion dollars bonusOccasionally panders but makes its subject matter interesting and even, to an extent, engaging. 'The Big Short (2015)' takes a unique approach when trying to communicate its complex jargon and ideas - that being that it slots in celebrity cameos wherein the star straight-up tells you the definition of a specific term in the simplest way possible - and what that does is dilute the density of the piece without necessarily dumbing it down. This can occasionally seem like pandering, though, despite that it fits into the flick's overall fast-paced, free-flowing and fourth-wall nudging aesthetic. The picture commendably manages to make the somewhat dry source-material, or rather subject-matter, interesting and even, to an extent, engaging. It focuses on a set of characters that seem realistic and rounded enough to warrant our empathy when they're given the screen time to earn it. The film does become a little too unfocused and slightly cold in the long run, which prevents it from being any more investing than it is. 7/10Doesn't Tell The Whole Story But Worth A Watch For those who lived through it, we all knew how this ended so the story really is the why did it hsppen? And there is plenty of explanation here. Except the government is almost totally left out of the story. I read somewhere Clinton's deregulation in the '90s led to the subprime crisis in 2007/08. Anyhow, well worth a watch especially for those who didn't live through it.Mildly amusing semi-documentary marred by leftist Hollywood preaching (spoiler alert) They did a pretty good job of turning a semi-documentary into a mildly entertaining movie by using "cool" characters (I gave it a "4" out of 10). (Possible spoiler ahead): What nearly ruined it for me was when they dropped the claim in at the end that the rich people in banking and politics turned around and blamed the 2008 crash on "immigrants and poor people", which is an untrue fabrication.  The current uproar is not about legal immigration, it's about illegal aliens and enforcing existing immigration law. The movie inserts a blatant leftist take on a hot button issue which has little to do with the topic of this movie, and many Americans like me will strongly disagree with.  Made me sort of regret I'd given Hollywood twenty bucks to see it. I've cut back on what I'm willing to pay to see, because of all the actors speaking out on politics in an obnoxious fashion. They're free to do that, but I don't have to pay to go see them either!Steve Carell as I've never seen him before What everyone else said: brilliant movie, educational, entertaining, etc. But the eye-opener for me was Steve Carell. My respect for him as an actor skyrocketed after this movie. Maybe I've been missing something, but I've never seen him in a serious role before. When watching this movie, I immediately latched on to Mark Baum as someone to whom I should be paying attention. I later found out that he was played by Carell and I had a tough time reconciling that. I think Steve Carell has many great dramatic roles in his future and I am very pleased with that because I'm not a huge fan of his comedy. I like his comedy well enough, but his dramatic chops are several steps above. I said what I came to say in the previous paragraph; this paragraph is just an attempt to make IMDb's minimum length requirement.brilliant idea but I didn't want to pay money for an economic class the movie in general deserve 6 out ten for the magnificence acting not else the whole movie me and the crowd waiting to understand the concept of banking and money without any clue about what happening , something to difficult to understand even when the try to make it simple . about the idea of where our money is go it is brilliant , the movie start and end with the same flow without any idea about what going on the direction is OK , nothing will take your eyes same as the soundtrack or the music in the movie if it found the only good thing in the movie is the actor , very famous names and to be honest the all did very good , the play the rule in magnificence aspect { so real } as a conclusion i don't recommend to watch the movie as you will feel so stupid trying to understand economic not in a good way , after all we are not professional in banking if you would try to watch just to enjoy acting not elseEntertaining and educational First let me say that this movie was hardly a comedy for me- i didn't laugh even once. Though the atmosphere is light and playful, the subject is very serious. Adam McKay did great to adapt the novel and direct this film- it has great phase, explains the complex banking terminology and the events as they unfold. Yes, the events unfold 4 years- Michael Burry caught eye of the oncoming catastrophe 3 years before the actual collapse (which tells you enough about the government oversight, banking employees competence and rating agencies honesty). One guy with a computer and a M.D. did better to foresee the future of the US than all of the above - outrageous is too soft of a word to describe. As many others said - this is a must see educational experience! The whole cast did great to portray the characters involved- they are all profit driven individuals, but to blame them for capitalizing on others financial incompetence is hardly fair- they even tried to warn the people (motives for which are questionable), but got turned away by the "serious" media outlets. What else were they supposed to do- post their prediction on the Huffington Post?? Great movie experience through and through.Wolf wannabe. I don't get it.......and I don't mean the banking lingo! Having seen this movie I overheard the reviews calling it hilarious and I thought they must be talking about another movie. I found not a single part of this movie amusing even thinking back on it in a comedic light.  To me this movie was just an awkward cousin desperately trying to live up to the success of The Wolf of Wall Street (the bath description scene just makes this even more obvious) If you are interested in the world of finance then I'm sure there are qualities that will be informative but apart from that I don't understand who the focus audience of this movie is, apart from simply trying to pull in fans of the listed stars.  Definitely give this one a miss unless you are looking for a lesson in economics with no benefit at the end.Interesting and well done There is a lot of technical information that the audience needs know to appreciate the story and the movie uses many different devices to get us up to speed, from ordinary graphics, to the characters directly addressing the audience, to elaborate skits explaining some of the more obscure financial terms. It is inventive, funny and works well. There are two very eccentric characters and Christian Bale and Steve Carell do an amazing job portraying them. In fact, all the acting is realistic and intense. The only problem was, even though I enjoyed how stylish and well made the movie is, I was never sure what it was about. It was not about the financial meltdown and yet it was also not really about the characters that went up against wall Street and won. You saw them in action and it was fun watching them do their thing but you never got to know them. You never get emotionally involved. They should have ditched the Brown- Hedge Fund story and devoted that time to the other side, showing what was happening at the investment banks and how that culture was driving the process, like in "Liar's Poker". That way you could see the battle from both sides and appreciate what they achieved a little more. An interesting and entertaining movie done in an ultra modern style and I enjoyed it, but as a story it isn't all there.One of the worst movies I have ever seen I had mixed feelings before watching this movie - many people were saying this is one of year's best, but it's also on a such of specific matter-the financial crisis in the middle of the last decade. I don't want to go into details regarding the movie, but it was done in such a manner and in such a language (it's supposed to be in English :)), that for a person who is not personally involved in the financial world and terms, it is completely not understandable. After watching it, I was thinking: I lost 2 hours of my life watching a movie (not for the first time), but after these 2 hours I have nothing to show for - I didn't understand anything of it (maybe for the first time). OK, I said even if it's not my kind of movie, I should at least know what is going on in it! Well no-it was done in such a way, that I am pretty sure, even the actors in it didn't know what they are talking about. And these are some great actors-Brad Pitt, Steve Carell, Christian Bale... They played good, but they had no clue, what's going on! Even if the original idea was good-to make a movie about this, it was done in completely the wrong way! The Globes nominated it for best picture comedy (and what's horrifying me, it's probably gonna win), but let's be honest-there is not a single funny moment in this movie. I have never watched my watch so many times in the course of 2h. In my opinion this was one of the worst and most boring movies of 2015!!! This is a proof how you can waste such a talent - and the talent gathered in The Big Short (very short) was great.The movie no one cares for, the film everyone needs to see. The movie puts in perspective the criminality that takes place within the one percent. Puts it into terms the lay person could understand so they can understand the corruption taking place. The whole time you are telling yourself ( what is this ) ( no way ) a hard pill to swallow as a working class. The acting is exactly what you expect from the actors in it. The film overall was a B+. From the director behalf I felt there were some cuts that didn't make sense to me and made me feel like something was left out. Although this is a movie that everyone should see it sad to know that it won't get its message across to the audience that needs it.Dear God Good I wasn't expecting to like this film as much as I did. I have seen lots of new articles, interviews and talking heads that like to portray Wall Street and the banks as just these innocent darlings that happened to get in over their heads. The general gist is that the are like lambs, if you will, swept up by events beyond their control.  So I was expecting the same white wash, condescending drivel from this film. Instead I got a humorous, subtle and quite importantly, entertaining take on the housing bubble. It is dam hard to recommend something to friends that is informative unless it passes the entertaining and fun quotient. This film passes the mark by miles.Outstanding. The Kama Sutra of illustrations of how we were screwed and how blatant capitalism failed due to blatant corruption. This hit every note and then some for me. Christian Bale alone was brilliant. Then add in Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and an outstanding supporting cast. I knew roughly 70% of what was presented here, but the contextualization of the facts through the eyes of the short sellers was just genius. You would have thought that the cover up would have been what failed the perpetrators, instead it almost worked, and quite possibly will again without the always dirty word: Regulation. The depth and clarity of the drama and the facts together raises my hopes for humankind. Brilliant in inception and execution.The financial Matrix and guess who the batteries are... I saw the movie just a few hours ago. I liked it. I have no training whatsoever in the banking-financial system. I have watched a few documentaries (as I am sure most people have done) about finances and the economy and I used all these knowledge to help me through the movie. I had to pause and rewind a few times to try to get the idea of what was shown. Definitely it is difficult to understand if one does not know the banking lingo. But any kind of movie that deals with a specific subject will have to use the specific lingo. For example if it is a movie about a sport, or a technical subject etc etc or something you are not familiar with, then you will hear a lot of terms that have to do with that specific subject. And if you have no or little idea about the subject, you will either get confused, bored of feel stupid or won't care.  And THAT it is clearly pointed out in the beginning of the movie. You will either get confused, bored, feel stupid ooooooor you will just not care...... It is a Hollywood movie after all and that will make someone not trust it and say "well it is a movie and not all facts, hell most of them are just a story and are not true or made to look a certain way to serve some side". Well, I will have to agree. Hollywood is a well oiled ENTERTAINMENT machine to "feed" the masses and serve a purpose. Confused and bored I understand... maybe even stupid cause 90% of us have not studied banking/economics. But how can anyone not care about how some F#$@#$%^ers have designed and used all these scams to F$%^&amp;* up the economy and people's lives worldwide!?!?!?!?!? Not all movies are made to ENTERTAIN. Some actually are made to say something even if they are done the Hollywood way. And it is up to the individual to get interested, to get thinking, to dig dipper, to want to learn more. What they come up with is solely up to them. I read reviews on the movie. For those who didn't like it cause it wasn't entertaining I have no argument with. They watch a movie, any kind of movie, only to be entertained and that is their right. But for those that didn't like it cause it was difficult to follow or cause they saw it from a political point of view, I believe they have lost the whole point. Some reviews asked the question about the demographic of this movie. In my opinion it should start with 15-16 year old teenagers, boys and girls of course of all races and religions. Just like in that age one begins to get to know how to drive and gets sexual orientation that can actually understand the why and the how and all that is included.  In the beginning of the movie, a parallel is made with the Big Depression 80 something years ago. I have read in the reviews that there is no mention about the Federal Reserve and how it operates. That was totally spot on cause that is the base for all financial and fiscal matters and how the economy is being run. Democrats and Republicans (chose whichever political sides in the country you live in) don't matter. Only the FED(and the equivalent of any country you live in) does. But that is a story to be shown in another movie..... or anyone can look for details in writing or in documentaries. If one does so, then one will better understand the movie in discussion and have a better idea what banks/bankers are all about in collaboration with the governments (all kinds of political side governments) all over the world. There are no good guys in this movie, in this story. There are only people who operated in the system, found a flaw? in it and manipulated it to benefit from it. Like Steve Carrel character's wife tells him: "Saints do not live on Park Avenue". Some of them felt shitty about it one way or another, some didn't. Characters in this movie/story are not portrayed so that the majority of the audience can like or identify with them.  So, it is upon the viewer and how much information they have or want to have.An economic thriller TEN STARS! I gave this film the highest rating because it goes beyond entertainment to attempt to explain how the system could be so fatally flawed. I think I will watch it again so I can thoroughly understand the details. The movie is not partisan. But if you get your economic views from Fox or Drudge you will hate this movie. Both sides were guilty of the asinine deregulation of the banks that created casino capitalism. As late as 2008 one presidential candidate was saying that "the fundamentals of the economy are strong". The movie shows how the rating agencies that gives the bonds their letter grades are both incompetent and corrupt. The ending is remarkable because it lays out in stark terms how the bad guys not only won but got the US taxpayer to subsidize the bank CEOs' and managers' multi-million dollar bonuses that they are still getting. Only one low level banker got a prison term for this evil act of raw greed and corruption.  The American people still don't understand what happened (because a lot of people at the top don't want them to know). This movie is a long overdue first step in explaining it.A MUST see movie, especially for those who lived it. If it wasn't so true and had I not experienced first hand, I'd say it was a brilliantly thought up story akin to Oceans 11-13 or "The Sting" (back in the 70's). Unfortunately, it's a true story and my business was wiped about because of it (residential architect). Greed and fraud. That's how the house of cards came tumbling down. If you aren't up on finance/wall street, go anyway...you'll get the jist of what happened. Great for discussion afterwards with anyone closely related to the story. We ALL have and are still suffering from this majestic meltdown of character which resulted in what I think is worse than the great depression (we still have years until recovery puts this in the rear view mirror)... Only thing I felt should have been more of a focus on was the story of Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve. He started this whole mess. Once wall street saw the Fed's would back anything and print "funny money" - game on. Greed took over and fraud, it's kissing cousin, followed suit.  If Obama would have stepped in (his first year in office) and let BofA FAIL and then restructure/breakup the big banks - this whole debacle would have been a shorter recovery with new rules in place. Instead, what did he do?? Bail out the auto industry. I only hope more American's see this movie and DEMAND more criminal charges for those that were at the top. Unfortunately that won't happen. I lost everything during this mess and it will take years more to recover (and I was one of the "good guys")...I feel everyone's pain watching this movie and re-living it.  A MUST see...Nothing Short of Fantastic Directed by Adam McKay, whose past movies have been straight up comedies, albeit good comedies, I didn't know what to expect when going into this film. I have a good general knowledge of financial terminology and of the housing crisis in general, but after watching this movie, I realize that there was so much I actually didn't know about, or knew but was wrong about. I can see how to many people, much of the information presented in the film is going to fly over their heads because it is a bunch of jargon about numbers and financial situations, but to me it was fascinating.  Adam McKay does a fantastic job adapting Michael Lewis' book to what I believe to be the simplest way to put the information given. Furthermore, he manages to blend a sense of outrage and sorrow for what happened to people with his signature clever and straightforward humor. Furthermore, the sense of outrage is carried on throughout the movie almost as an undercurrent to every joke, like there is some twisted double meaning behind every man and his decisions. This rage is best expressed in Steve Carrel's character who, ironically, needs to go to anger management courses to deal with those feelings. Along with Steve Carrel's character (who in my opinion is the best performance), there are fantastic performances from Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and even more unknowns like Hamish Linklater. One of the best things about this film is its very quick-footed pace. It's as though the movie is racing to find out as much as it can before the inevitable crash happens. While other may find this pace annoying and hard to keep up, to me I was so tuned in to everything said that the pace just escalated my enjoyment. The film loses a little steam at the end, but that's only because the tone turns darker and much more serious.  Overall, The Big Short is a very important film, a scathingly funny film that raises awareness about a crisis that most people might only have known at the surface level. It's one of the most enthralling films of the year as well as one of the most entertaining. Expect some awards come Oscar season.A Must-See Film for All Americans The Big Short should be required viewing for everyone in the world affected by the financial crisis in 2008, which means almost everyone in the Western world and certainly everyone in America. Michael Lewis seemed to be one of the few journalists who actually understood what was going on and described it to readers in his book while Fox News was blaming the whole thing on a few deadbeat homeowners who didn't know the difference between a variable rate mortgage and money left on the street. Even the film tried to place at least part of the blame on strippers with a couple of home equity loans which is complete crap.  One of the conversations in the book went something like this: "Who would take out a loan on a house if they couldn't make the first payment?" This was countered by Steve Eiseman, "Who would give a home loan to someone who couldn't make the first payment?" The housing meltdown was the biggest crime in US history and, as the film points out, no one went to jail for it except one unlucky Wall Street slob. The truth is that the police should have taped off all of this end of Manhattan and designated it a crime scene and out courts should have brought a huge crowd of people to justice. Instead no laws were changed and the same thing, or something even worse, is likely to happen again sooner rather than later. The film does a marvelous job not only of making the technical details understandable to the layman but in making a supremely entertaining film (the most important thing in cinema). Spoiler Alert: The bad guys win in this movie. The rest of us lost and will continue to lose until we stand up and do something about it.Eye Opener of the corruption in USA ! Wow ! Wow ! Wow !!! Most people do accept that corruption is rampant in the USA, but after seeing this movie you will ask yourself how is this even possible. How can people be so irresponsible and unaccountable? Everyone needs to see this movie to wake up and start asking questions. Christian Bale, Steve Carell are fabulous and the script is awesome. Wonder where Christian, Steve, Brad, and Ryan are investing their money now. I seriously doubt their money is invested on Wall Street after making this movie. Wall street is a ponzi scheme. Madoff was peanuts compared to what Wall street is doing. Do not believe what the 6 o'clock news is telling you. Do not believe what politicians are telling you. Do not believe what economist on TV are telling you. All the "experts" are in serious conflict of interests because they are being paid to read a prepared narrative.Storytelling at its most effective As an aspiring student of finance and obviously one of the many who believes the world is run by corporations and governments colluding, this movie was the perfect entertainment that brought in bouts of humour with cameos and dramatisation when required, the end asking questions in an unfunny way but complemented by a satirical note after. What's not to like? Chrisitian Bale is just too f***ing good (excuse my French) in his role as the nerdy broker whose meticulousness is well complemented by his non-exuberant non wall street demeanour. Ryan Gosling is convincing as the plagiariser who knew what to do with the golden nugget of info. Steve Carell is probably right after Bale, if we choose to rank performance, that is. His rather unusual role as the uncaped crusader of wall street is interesting, and probably the most unlikely character but nonetheless one of the most pivotal ones as well. Brad Pitt was short and effective, and unremarkable, which is exactly what the story required. But, again, the cameos. I don't really care if the top critics have a distaste for such stunts, but they were such a welcome footnote in bringing in some lightness to the convoluted jargon of finance. They were the garnish that's just makes the meal flavourful and a sight to behold. And as a music lover, the end theme was right on the money. Although, I have to admit, the amount of s**te that year produced, I believe my praise is kind of biased. The big short allowed me to believe in Hollywood again.The Truth is as Corrupt as Fiction 9.75 of 10. For those who have seen American Psycho (2000), there's extra beauty in this with Christian Bale portraying a different, but nearly as odd if not as sociopathic, type of American Wall Street oddity. In fact, the film captures the wide variety of borderline sociopaths occupying banks and Wall Street. While technically a comedic thriller, satire, based on the very true and vivid recent history of banks, it would be accurate to call it an acted documentary too. Besides being amusing and educational on the history of the big bailout, it weaves in energetic music, scenery, and well-acted eccentric characters so that it overcomes all the usual complaints about documentaries and historical re-enactments. About the only drawback involves how it decides to dramatize and then tell the truth about one particular dramatization when it wasn't really necessary and added some unneeded length to the film. Fortunately, the film doesn't depend upon it and it is interesting even if somewhat pointless and detracting from the immersion.The most boring movie for 2015 Under zero emotions! The story supposed to be great but it wasn't. That drama was not a drama but just some pieces of stories that this director tried to joined by force and to give a meaning during its way. Most of the biggest troubles was that camera that never stopped shaking and zooming in and out and moving up and down with no sense even in the most quiet portrait. There is no need to play with moving camera in senseless way to make the story more dramatic. Big disappointing even in some characters there. Not professional. Pretending! I would ask to this director to give me back the time i spent to watch his bullshit and maybe to tell to him how he can do this movie in more positive way.Repetitive, preachy with little insights Absolutely same story of the protagonists (Brad Pitt, Christian Bale and Steve Carrell). They could have rather avoided making each scene from all three guys' perspective. It is like same scene repeated twice. The movie which pretends to be informative, is full of errors. Christian bale in one scene says loan to value is 5. This makes no sense, he probably meant loan to equity. The Jenga tower was made wrong. It was showing AAA to be most risky. Most of the speeches were cynical with little meat. The key climatic speech by Steve had no logic and only rhetoric like "I have no issues in telling you that you are wrong". But do you also have any reasons why the said person is wrong. Avoid, if you possible. Much more interesting documentaries are available on the housing crisis.one of the worst movies i've ever seen i thought that the reason to watch a movie was to care about the characters, but this had no characters to care about. The direction was great, in terms of the ideas shown in the movie, but it was f-ing awful. I liked the asides to the camera, but the shots of moving images was dizzying. As a person who is not into wall street and trading, i didn't understand half of the film. Sorry, but this ranks as a complete waste of time in my books. The actors were great, but I didn't care about any of them. Nice to see Brad Pitt again, but no one made me care about their story. I guess if you understand wall street and it's lingo you would care more about this movie. This is my first review on IMDb and the movie so infuriated me that I felt I must write a review to express how deeply I hated it.The preview was the best part The preview made this movie seem a lot more interesting than it actually is. If you know nothing about banks and bonds, or just don't simply care about that, this is not the movie for you. The humor is very immature and not funny as nobody in the theater was laughing when a joke was made. The plot is very convoluted and confusing so much that it puts you to sleep because nothing is going on. It was a complete waste of money and we left the theater before the movie finished. While the acting may be good and the actors are popular faces, it's hard to get by the bad organization and confusing plot. Anyone who was hoping for an interesting, funny, on the edge type of movie, this is not the one. The movie is not dramatic at all as nothing was giving a sense of urgency. It is like just a bunch of men arguing about bonds and not doing any work. That's about it.
Legal/historical drama, not action Don't be fooled by the title. Make sure you know what you're getting yourself into when you watch this film. Bridge of Spies is literally about the Cold War Bridge of Spies, where Soviet/US spies were exchanged through negotiations. This is nothing like "The Americans" (FX TV drama - for some high unrealistic and over-sexualized espionage action - redirect here) and the most action-packed scene you will see is Francis Gary Powers getting shot out of his U2 plane during his mission.  Bridge of Spies is really a historical/legal drama. And based on my preliminary research, they seem to be getting most of their facts right. Obviously a little bit embellished for Hollywood's sake, Bridge of Spies does a fine job as a historical docudrama. There is a lot of talking, but it's meaningful talking. At times, the film can be a little slow {opening scene, especially}, but give it a chance and you might enjoy it. History buffs like myself will definitely enjoy it. But thrill-seekers, you're better off to see the new James Bond movie instead.A very good, very Spielberg motion picture, starring Tom Hanks. This movie hit me really strangely. I was expecting a political drama about the cold war, and while indeed it was that, I was not expecting to have so much fun and for Bridge of Spies to be so humorous.  The Coen brothers writing a movie Steven Spielberg would direct just sounds like a winning combination and it really was. Sealing the deal, was a great performance by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks does what he does best, by playing an everyday man in an average life. James Donovan was just an insurance lawyer who gets caught up in the middle of the Cold War. Bridge of Spies, starts him off so normal and then turns his life into quite an adventure. And I do mean adventure. In the hands of Spielberg, the movie's visuals were large and epic. I was expecting this movie to feel more like his last flick, Lincoln. Instead it feels more like Indiana Jones, as James Donovan travels to Berlin at the time when the wall was being completed.  Watching Hanks play Donovan who is just swept into an overwhelming situation and just keeps his cool and his charm is just highly enjoyable.  Totally loved Bridge of Spies, It's one of the best team ups between Hanks and Spielberg and even though Lincoln was a great movie, Bridge of Spies is everything Spielberg is capable of. So entertaining."And the Best Supporting Actor Oscar goes to... Mark Rylance" There are combinations of film makers that make you confident, as you pay your ticket price, that you are not going to be terribly disappointed: Steven Spielberg directing; Tom Hanks taking the lead; Janusz Kaminski behind the camera; Michael Kahn editing and a Coen brothers script (with Matt Charmon (Suite Fran√ßaise)). And Bridge of Spies doesn't disappoint, particularly for someone of my more advanced years (I was born the year following the film's climatic events) who remembers well the terror of potential nuclear catastrophe that hung over the world through the 60's and 70's. In a story based on true events, Hanks plays James Donovan (diverging somewhat from reality here) as an insurance lawyer dragged by his firm into defending Rudolf Abel, the accused Soviet spy played exquisitely by British stage acting legend Mark Rylance. Against this backdrop, the international blue touch paper is about to be lit by the shooting down over Russia of Gary Powers (Austin Stowell from "Whiplash") in his U-2 spy plane (sorry ‚Äì "article"). Donovan becomes instrumental in unofficially negotiating on behalf of the US government the release of Powers in East Berlin. The deal is jeopardized by his boy-scout tendencies to also want to help another US captive Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers). I've read some negative reviews of this film in the papers that made me quite cross, describing it as "yawnsome" and "sanctimoniously dull". For me, nothing could be further from the truth and the packed Saturday night audience I saw this with seemed equally gripped from beginning to end, silent save for the odd laugh where some appropriate humor is weaved into the story. Tom Hanks is solid and believable as the fish-out-of-water lawyer, albeit that the role is played with a large spoonful of patriotic American sugar as Donovan trumpets about the importance of the constitution over the lynch-mob mentality of the general public. Alan Alda ‚Äì great to see again on the big screen ‚Äì channels his best Hawkeye-style exasperation as Donovan's boss, looking for a clean and quick conviction. But it is Mark Rylance ‚Äì an irregular player in movies, and due to appear again in next year's "BFG" ‚Äì who shines out as the acting star of the film. His salubrious and calm turn as the cornered spy just reeks of class and if he isn't nominated for a Best Supporting Actor nomination for this then there is no justice. (A special 'casting recognition award' to my wife Sue for spotting that the actress playing Judge Byer's wife ‚Äì Le Clanch√© du Rand ‚Äì was Meg Ryan's mother in Sleepless in Seattle 22 years ago!)  The cinematography is superb with some gorgeous tracking shots and framed scenes. Most outstanding of all is the scene depicting the traumatic construction of the Berlin wall ‚Äì long tracking shots in greys and blues delivering a truly breathtaking piece of cinema. In general I'd give a big shout-out to both the art department and the special effects team in making the desolation of East Berlin feel so real. It makes the similar scenes, that I commented positively on in the recent "Man from U.N.C.L.E." seem like an amateur school production. The special effects team also contribute in making the shooting down of the U-2 a thrilling piece of cinema. Music is sparingly and effectively used by Thomas Newman, and it can be no greater complement to the composer than that I was wondering until the end titles as to whether it was another Spielberg/ John Williams collaboration or not. A great film, one of my favorites this year. Highly recommended, especially if you are over 50. You should also get out to a cinema to see this one ‚Äì it will be far more effective on the big screen than the small one. (Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks.)An unshowy Steven Spielberg does a master's job with Cold War tensions, honoring a real-life attorney's victory over fear. A feel-good Cold War melodrama, Bridge of Spies is an absorbing true-life espionage tale very smoothly handled by old pros who know what they're doing. In its grown-up seriousness and basis in historical conflict, Steven Spielberg's first feature since Lincoln three years ago joins the list of the director's half-dozen previous "war" films, but in its honoring of an American civilian who pulled off a smooth prisoner exchange between the East and West during a very tense period, the film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does now. Spielberg's fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, which world- premiered at the New York Film Festival and opens commercially on October 16, looks to generate stout box-office returns for Disney through the autumn season. For people of Spielberg's generation, the early years of the nuclear era and the stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union represents a significant part of the fabric of childhood. With the passage of time, it's possible to tell stories of the time without furnishing them with overt propagandistic overlays, and for Westerners there is the added built-in appeal of the "we won" factor and the perception that dealing with adversaries was so much simpler then than it is now. As their focus in this impeccably rendered recreation of a moment in history, most palpably represented by the building of the Berlin Wall, Spielberg and screenwriters Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen have chosen a sort-of Atticus Finch of the north, a principled, American Everyman insurance attorney unexpectedly paged to represent a high-level Soviet spy caught in New York. There is no question that Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is guilty, but James B. Donovan (Hanks), a proper and decent family man with a professional dedication to his client and an abiding loyalty to the principles of the U.S. Constitution, has a quick and intuitive read of any legal situation and shrewdly stays at least one step ahead of the game in almost any situation.One of Spielberg's best most recent movies Bridge Of Spies is a historical drama film starring Tom Hanks, co-written by the Coen brothers, and directed by Steven Spielberg. Even though its subject matter of the Cold War is something I know very little about, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am now more interested than ever to learn more about it. I rank it among the best of Spielberg's most recent movies. In 1957, tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War are at their peak. Spies from both the American CIA and Soviet KGB are a major threat to the security of both world powers and each side often resorts to hasty measures to stop any classified information from being leaked. In Brooklyn, New York, Rudolf Abel is arrested under the suspicion of being a spy. James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is assigned as Abel's defence lawyer. However the idea of defending a potential Soviet spy proves to be an unpopular and difficult task for Donovan. Meanwhile, over in the Soviet Union, an American spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down and captured by the KGB. As a means to ease tension between the two warring countries, Donovan proposes a swap between the two prisoners of war, Abel for Powers. Despite containing barely any action scenes and being almost entirely made up of talking, the film never feels boring or slow paced. This is most likely due to the Coen brothers' clever screenplay and Steven Spielberg's creative direction. There were many suspenseful moments where it felt like the prisoner negotiations would go horribly wrong and that kept me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hanks also gives another memorable performance as James B. Donovan, once again proving his versatility as an actor. I rate it 8.5/10.Great Spy Thriller In 1957, during the Cold War, the insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is assigned by the Bar association to defend in court the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), who was captured by the FBI. Donovan is successful and Rudolf is sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death penalty. Meanwhile the American pilot and spy Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is arrested by the Soviet government while taking photos from a spy plane that crashed. The CIA summons Donovan to help in the negotiation to exchange the two spies. When Donovan learns that the American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) was arrested in the border of East Berlin while trying to bring his German girlfriend to the West Berlin, he decides to include the student in the negotiation. However his proposal is not supported by the CIA that is interested in Powers only. Further, Powers is prisoner of the soviet government and Pryor is prisoner of the GDR (German Democratic Republic). Will Donovan succeed in his intent? "Bridge of Spies" is a great spy thriller based on a true story in the period of the Cold War. The plot is engaging and the cinematography, costume design and art direction are amazing. It is unnecessary to comment the direction of Steven Spielberg and the performance of Tom Hanks, perfect as usual, but it is impressive the capacity of negotiation of James B. Donovan. This American lawyer is shown as an impressive negotiator, having cold blood to make tough decisions. The credits informs that Donovan has been also successful negotiating later in Cuba the release of prisoners. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Ponte dos Espi√µes" ("Bridge of Spies")Spielberg and Hanks--fry to find a better duo than that for a great film. "Everyone deserves a defense. Everyone matters." James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) In Bridge of Spies, Steven Spielberg once again masterfully goes to the historical drama with a righteous man's theme (think Schindler and Lincoln for starters). This time lawyer James B. Donovan is asked to defend an accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Able (Mark Rylance, superb), in order to show the world the American justice system is democratic.  The story is "inspired by true events" with the outline of the exchange of Able for U-2 downed pilot Gary Powers historically accurate. As usual, Spielberg recreates the times with the atmosphere, cars, and film noir aspect of a spy thriller in the figurative and literal Cold War. He said, "I always wanted to tell the stories that really interested me in my personal life‚Äîwhich are stories about things that actually happened." Hanks is central to Spielberg's vision of the lone hero defying the odds and supporting the highest ideals of the American Constitution and the individually virtuous man. Never does Hanks overplay the good-guy card; he's just very adept at playing an everyman not always right but always righteous.  The dialogue is crisp, a no fooling around typical of Spielberg and Hanks but a charming bad guy as well: James Donovan: "Aren't you worried?" Rudolf Abel: "Would it help?" As producer Kristie Macosko Krieger commented about Spielberg, "He's got a childlike sense of wonder. He never gets tired of hearing stories . . . . " Bridge of Spies is vintage Spielberg with a Lincoln-like atmosphere, righteous hero, and intriguing multi-plot, an entertaining spy story brimming with humanity.  As the director says, "This is more about very smart people in conversation with each other, and the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads is that, if they make the wrong decisions, it's the end of the world."Good acting can't save true-life lugubrious Cold War tale that lacks suspense What motivated Steven Spielberg to go ahead and take on a project such as "Bridge of Spies?" I've read that it was simply his nostalgia for the Cold War era, firmly ensconced in his childhood memories. Unfortunately, the vehicle to tell that story‚Äîthe combined tale of the capture and trial of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel and swap for the downed US pilot Gary Powers on Russian soil‚Äîpacks little punch due to its obvious lack of suspense. The "Bridge of Spies" narrative can be easily summarized in a short paragraph: the US government unofficially conscripts insurance lawyer James Donovan to defend Soviet spy Abel after he's captured by the Feds in Brooklyn. The trial is a foregone conclusion but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence Abel to prison instead of death since he could be used in a prisoner exchange in the future. Sure enough, after Gary Powers is shot down in his U2 spy plane, Donovan is again called upon to negotiate a prisoner swap with the Russians. A wrench is thrown into the negotiations when a US graduate student is arrested as a spy by the East Germans. Donovan deftly negotiates the swap of Abel for both Powers and the American student, and the exchange is facilitated with little incident. As historical incidents related to the Cold War go, the Abel-Powers narrative is hardly one of high drama. A major problem is that Donovan has no single, strong antagonist to play off of. The negotiations with his Soviet counterpart, a KGB agent masquerading as a diplomat, are a forgone conclusion. We know of course that the spy swap will be successful, so where is the suspense? The "heart-pounding" moment is hardly heart pounding at all‚Äîas Abel and Powers are about to exchange places, there is a slight delay before the East Germans deliver the American student to complete their part of the bargain. Yes of course I understand that Donovan dramatically threatened the East Germans, as they could have been blamed by the Russians for sabotaging the spy swap. But their decision was really a forgone conclusion too, as the East Germans were always under the yoke of the Russians, and were in no position to act independently (balking at giving up the student of course was their way of "saving face"). With all this lack of suspense, it was incumbent upon Mr. Spielberg's screenwriters (including "luminaries" Joel and Ethan Coen) to manufacture a series of fictional events to spice up a "thriller" that hardly thrills at all! Here a few examples: spectators at Abel's sentencing did not loudly object to the no death penalty sentence; Donovan and family were not victims of a drive-by shooting; Donovan's coat was not stolen by a gang in East Berlin (in reality, Donovan merely observed a gang nearby) and Donovan never personally observed people being killed as they attempted to climb over the Berlin Wall. Spielberg's attempt to recreate the era is rife with numerous gaffes. Early on Donovan is seen riding in a in a NYC R-32 subway car that first went into service in 1964 (the scene is set in 1961). That wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that the interior of the car appears to be from the 70s and beyond, and not 1961. The gaffes, which include anachronisms, character error, continuity, errors in geography, factual errors, plot holes, revealing mistakes and miscellaneous errors are all detailed under the Bridge of Spies "Goofs" section on IMDb. "Bridge of Spies" is not a complete loss as the film features some excellent acting by Tom Hanks as Donovan and Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy Abel. With its 40 million dollar budget and decided lack of suspense, I wonder why the film was made in the first place. It of course gives Spielberg an opportunity to peddle a rather simplistic and obvious message: there were some bad people on the other side of the Iron Curtain (faceless soldiers shooting people trying to escape over the Berlin War) but also individuals such as master spy Abel, who end up displaying unexpected glimpses of humanity.Turkey Without The Gravy I am biased in my review of BRIDGE OF SPIES. The Cold War is my thing, always has been my thing. I am dazzled by that time in history: surveillance, the cars, CIA, Eisenhower, and the mystique of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.  From the trailer of this film, I expected a delicious plate of Cold War atmosphere, intrigue, and commentary. Like a gleeful child, I sprinted to the movie theatre ‚Äì expecting a non-pretentious high octane version of Mad Men. I anticipated my favorite era in history being served up like LET ME IN (a piece of 1980s period perfection elegantly directed by Matt Reeves). I held close the trailer as I landed my perfect middle seat in the theatre. The clips of a U2 Surveillance jet spiraling at 70,000 feet, children overflowing in tears as they watch a thermonuclear film strip, and Tom Hanks' face plastered to a subway window as we see guards firing at bystanders trying to climb over the Berlin Wall.  Then you add Steven Spielberg to the mix ‚Äì the master of the period piece ‚Äì modern cinema - the evoker of our deepest emotions. One of my favorite Spielberg films is Munich. Munich captures the violence of the Middle East 70s with revere, respect, and revelation. This is what I wanted from Bridge Of Spies. I wanted a dark, harrowing portrait of the Cold War, I wanted this tense era exposed in Spielbergian fashion, and I wanted to have 1957-1961 ruminating in my heart, mind, and belly. Bridge of Spies, however, met none of my desired expectations.  Diluted by a PG-13 rating, filled with comedic moments (clearly due to the Coen Brothers having written or participated in this script) that don't tickle my fancy, and an avoidance of Cold War atmosphere ‚Äì Bridge Of Spies hit me like a tennis ball on the head.  It's taught, adequately plotted, and the hero is smart, likable, and witty. It's garnered rave reviews. But, for anyone that likes substance, don't look here. Spielberg's story is a moral tale ‚Äì of courage and standing up for one's ideals ‚Äì the universal plot which Steven devours like a hungry child.  Unfortunately, there's no stakes. Hanks follows his journey and does what he does best ‚Äì but his universe is given little context. You'll want turkey and you'll get turkey ‚Äì but you're not getting any gravy.  **Possible Spoilers ‚Äì Things that bugged me about the film was plethora of wasted opportunities. When you have Spielberg at the helm, you know what could have been ‚Äì  1. The relationship between the Lawyer (Hanks) and the Soviet Captive (Mark Rylance) is an unbalanced paper weight. We get a glimpse into the Lawyer's character, the archetypal Tom Hanks - fair, honest, moral, etc. We get very little info on the Captive. He is quiet, dignified, and keeps responding to Hanks wondering if he is aware of his dire situation, "Would it help?" Rylance is the typical Spielbergian "caught in the middle guy" ‚Äì much like Ben Kingsley in Schindler's List. Physically weak, trapped and powerless - yet stoic and unafraid. That being said, what are his motives? He is a spy but what drives him ‚Äì where is the monologue where he explains his background, what formed and shaped him and what forms the basis of his lifelong goals? 2. What I love about Mad Men is its strong focus on the media and culture of the era. Except for the end of Bridge of Spies (where we get a clip of Pierre Salinger informing the news of the spy swap) and an early scene of a teenage girl watching a late night story, there's not much to nibble on ‚Äì Spielberg wastes a huge opportunity in a class room scene where kids are watching a nuclear bomb film strip. Lifting the film strip like a YouTube Clip and then showing a few generic shots of kids watching it and one girl crying - the master of modern cinema stumbles and falls into shallow surf. In this instance, I wanted to yell at the editor ‚Äì build this up, let it seep in, give us some Wonder Years or Let Me In flavor. There's none to be had ‚Äì  3. Not only do we get a vapid Francis Gary Powers ‚Äì due to lackluster character development and the miscasting (in my opinion), but the U2 Surveillance storyline is about 12 minutes. Give me at least 25, Steven!! When the U2 is shot out of the sky, we get about a minute of action ‚Äì give us three. In addition, because Francis Gary Powers has no character development, I don't sympathize with him or even care if he comes home.  4. The PhD student who is included in the Prisoner Swap is devoid of character ‚Äì another guy that I could care less if he makes it home. Both guys appeared to have a lackluster indifferent time over the in the USSR. The Soviets dowsed Powers with water and German soldiers rip up the PHD students thesis paper ‚Äì oh no! 5. There is no discussion of the disastrous political implications of the U2 being shot down over the Soviet Union. Reluctant to authorize the mission, Eisenhower was smeared by its failure and left office of the President on a black cloud. However, we don't hear Eisenhower's name mentioned once in the story.  All and all, Spielberg delivers a cup of vanilla ice cream with fudge ‚Äì most audiences are going to love Hanks and the Soviet spy.  In the final analysis, it's a buddy film with some period costumes and a somewhat poignant conclusion. That being said, those that want a stirring pot of fear, sadness, and elation ‚Äì I suggest you wait for this on HBO and watch Munich instead.  Ted's Personal Enjoyment: C+interesting historical drama and a great performance "Bridge of Spies" from 2015 is about the Francis Gary Powers incident in the 1960s. As usual, with the exception of the Lincoln assassination, I remember it. This time, though, only vaguely. The U.S. arrested a Russian spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and chose James Donovan (Tom Hanks) who had some experience in military cases, to defend him. Abel is found guilty but Donovan is able to convince the Judge to commute his sentence to life in case the U.S. needs him later - for instance, if we should want to exchange him for one of our own. That situation happens when Francis Gary Powers, taking aerial photographs for the CIA, is shot down and taken prisoner. Donovan is then sent to negotiate the exchange. For many people, this will be a slow, talky drama, with one big action scene, Powers being shot down, and one scene of tension (if you don't know the outcome). It is, however, a very good drama with Hanks giving a strong and sometimes humorous performance as Donovan, thrust into the world of international spies and negotiations. He takes it upon himself to also work for the freedom of an American student, Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) who was arrested for being at the wrong place at the wrong time.  That student is the only person involved in the case who is alive today, at 83, and praised the film but thought they "took a lot of liberties with it." Well, that's Hollywood. The main reason, other than historical interest, to watch this film is the performance of Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel. A winner of three Tony awards, two Olivier awards, and a BAFTA, Rylance is a highly regarded stage actor, known as the best of his generation. He's made very few films but he's about to make more and take the film industry by storm. As Abel, Rylance creates a human being, portraying him as a quiet, unassuming older man sent to do a job. He bonds with Donovan, but he tells him that he's not afraid to die. He spends his time in prison drawing. It is a remarkable performance which has earned him an Oscar nomination. Strangely, many people involved in this incident didn't live too long after -- Abel, who returned to the Soviet Union and to his family, lectured for 10 years and died in 1971; Donovan died in 1970; and Powers died in a helicopter crash while working for a TV station in 1977. I hope the film will encourage some people to read up on this case - of course, I always hope that. Maybe some time somebody will do it rather than posting the question someone did about Gandhi -- was this a fictional character.Lukewarm Coldwar Drama by Spielberg with many painful grimaces by Hanks BRIDGE of SPIES, Spielberg // Starring Tom Hanks in Lukewarm Coldwar drama. Summary: Uninspired Spielberg Mountain from Molehill with pitiful Hanks in Pain throughout. Viewed at Colis√©e cinema, Marrakesh, Friday Dec. 4, 2015. By Alex Deleon. With so many intriguing Cold War subjects up for grabs one wonders what made Steven Spielberg choose this relatively minor Cold War incident as the subject matter of his latest directorial effort.  The background: In the summer of 1960 an American high altitude spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union and pilot Gary Powers who bailed out and survived was interned by the Russians. At about the same time a big time Russian spy with US citizenship was arrested and put on trail for treason in the USA. Idealistic New York attorney James Donovan (Hanks) defends him in court and is then recruited by the CIA to facilitate an exchange of this spy for captured U2 spy plane pilot Powers in Berlin. The exchange took place in divided Berlin on Feb. 20, 1962 at the height of the Kennedy administration six months prior to the Cuban Missiles crisis.  The foreground: The result: a big disappointment with a heavy handed script by the Coen Brothers and some very bad acting in a long tedious dragged out attempt to elevate this subject to the level of Greek tragedy with Tom Hanks pulling slightly different variations of a pained face in every scene he's in, which is most of the picture. Greek tragedy this is not, although we are compelled to feel a little sorry for Hanks when his steadfast defense of the American Constitution is met with hate, derision, and even death threats from his fellow Americans, and then he has to hide his dangerous spy exchange trip from his own family when he volunteers to go to Berlin on a thankless top secret mission to ease cold war tensions and save an American college student stranded in East Berlin into the bargain. En somme:to sum up -- From The combination Spielberg/Hanks and the setting in Berlin, a city I know so well, I expected much more. This turned out to be a routine, almost soppy Hanks performance and a very routine uninspired turn by Spielberg at the helm. First of all I remember the era of the film very well and it did not seem to me at the time to be nearly the momentous event it is built up to be in this film. If lawyer Donavan (Hanks) was in the news for a while it certainly wasn't a very big while, and the spy exchange at the bridge was merely seen as a minor event in much more momentous cold war Events of the time such as the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1962 and The Cuban missile crisis in October 1962. I remember thinking at the time that it was nice for our side to admit for once that We also Spy and thought that might be the ball Spielberg would run with. But the mawky family drama we are given, and the overall talkiness with little backup action, plus the building up of the the exchange on the Berlin bridge in freezing winter weather to an event of Superbowl proportions simply does not have the drama we are supposed to think it had. Overall, a dud that fails to go off in a stagy unrecognizable Berlin. Recommended only for die-hard Tom Hankniks who sympathize with Mr. next-door America, no matter what he does. As for the Cold War political background -- Google tells it much better. (Google, Gary Powers, U2 incident) Alex, Marrakesh. :carries a spirit of all-American-ism without being too preachy, keeping a wit about it and Tom Hanks One of the surprising things about Bridge of Spies is not really that Steven Spielberg directed this story, which tracks the trial and then trade of a Russian spy in 1957 (an exchange for an American pilot, and someone else who I'll get to shortly). It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script. It's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress). The Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance. In a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go. Bridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice ("Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now. Two little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax. Aside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.Burning Bridge with Boredom How Steven Spielberg went from the king of summer thrills to the most boring director in Hollywood is a problem that's perplexed me since I pried my eyes open through Lincoln. We all know the man can make a great movie. Most of us grew up on a diet of E.T., Jaws and Indiana Jones: spectacular event films with all the entertainment oomph of a theme park roller coaster. Then, Spielberg hit middle age and wanted to make important films for grown-ups. He made Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and Munich, but he also made Minority Report, A.I and War of the Worlds ‚Äì pretty decent action films with big star power. It looked like Spielberg had come of age with a sharpened skill set and a slightly deeper world view, but the more high-brow Spielberg gets, the duller his movies become... Inspired by real life events, and apparently a footnote in a JFK biography, Bridge of Spies tells the story of an insurance attorney named James Donovan. A mild-mannered family man plucked from a Norman Rockwell painting, Donovan is as American as the flag itself ‚Äì and it's a trait he waves at every opportunity, from gratuitous speeches about the American Constitution to his acceptance of a case he is destined to lose. In the opening act, we watch an older man (Mark Rylance) take his easel on the subway, sit in the park and paint, and very carefully remove a fake nickel from the underside of a park bench. The nickel is hollow, and written on a tiny piece of paper within, is a series of codes. The man's name is Rudolf Abel, and he's arrested for treason and espionage just a few moments later. Given the year is 1957, Abel's fate looks bleak. The Rosenbergs were executed just four years earlier after being convicted of similar charges, and Abel refuses to cooperate with the CIA, making him delectably disposable. These days, he'd probably just disappear, but back then, America still believed its own propaganda and the notion of due process. It must appear as if Abel is getting a fair and just trial, which is where James Donovan comes in... It feels a little like a greatest hits album, but the scenes with Mark Rylance have real pop. The two men have an interesting dynamic as ideological warriors who landed on different sides of the battlefield, and it's the only part of the film that has any real traction because everyone else is locked in a freezer of Cold War archetype. Spielberg capitalizes on the common ground, offering up timely and inspirational rhetoric concerning the importance of due process, Constitutional rights and freedoms, and the American way, but like Lincoln, the big speeches have all the subtlety of a Broadway musical... Abridged from Ex.Press.comA Well-Acted Cold War Thriller Bridge Of Spies is a well acted, thrilling, smart Cold War drama that features a Oscar worthy performance from Tom hanks. Bridge of Spies tells the true story of a Cold War spy swap, during the height of tension between the U.S. and Russia. The time period was so tense that when films can capture that tone it's usually special, that being said the film doesn't quite capture that tone, but it comes close. Tom Hanks performance, and Spielberg's seasoned direction manage to save the film. When the film could have been slow, they save it by using either humor, or great acting, Acting that will most likely get Hanks an Oscar nomination. In the end Bridge of Spies isn't as good as it could have been, but is still admittedly a great film that will undoubtedly get plenty of recognition at the 2015 Academy Awards.Some good acting in an utterly disappointing movie Mark Rylance stands out as the best reason to watch this movie. And, I feel tempted to say, the only reason to do so. His lines take the cream of the screenplay. I am quite a fan of spy movies. That is exactly why I find this to be extremely disappointing as a movie. Seeing Steven Spielberg's name come up at the final credits was a sort of cherry on the funeral cake. The direction and the editing are the two most disappointing elements of this production. Then parts of the story. It is all so predictable, so clich√©, so d√©j√†-vu. I happened to watch this film in the weeks in which the BBC broadcast a brilliant 5-part series entitled "London Spy". That is everything a spy-film fan can wish for. "Bridge of Spies" is everything but that. Underwhelming at best...Hanks &amp; Rylance Are Superb Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance lead the way here and give superlative performances in this cerebral and powerful Cold War drama. Another masterful movie from director Steven Spielberg, with a most solid screenplay from Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel. The films all centers around the initial defense of accused Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance) by attorney James B.Donovan (Hanks), which made Donovan a most unpopular man in America, especially when he appealed Abel's conviction all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the conviction by a 5-4 vote. Meanwhile, in 1960, a U.S. U-2 pilot, Francis Gary Powers was captured by the Soviets, after his spy plane was shot down over Soviet territory. Subsequently, the American State Dept. would ask Donovan to possibly negotiate an exchange of Abel and Powers, since Donovan had been contacted by the Soviets through the East Germans that this might be possible. Based on true events, there's plenty of intrigue here as Donovan, through intense and difficult negotiations, tries to acquire the release of the two prisoners, along with a third prisoner the American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), being held on "spy" charges by the East Germans. It will all culminate in some amazing and tense scenes on the German Glienicke Bridge. All in all, I found this to be a first class movie, that despite it's length of 2 hrs. and 21 min., had me absorbed throughout."It doesn't matter what people think. You know what you did." Spielberg knows what he did, but I have a few thoughts. Let's start with the title - You know, there's only one "spy" per se, who matters anyway. But it makes it sound like some thriller-diller, eh? Now Tom Hanks - uh, what's with that incredibly furrowed, knit brow all through the story. Makeup Oscar time? Did they borrow it from a Klingon? The woman who plays Donovan's wife? I know she's supposed to be convincingly all 1950s square - but really, heels and full lipstick all the time? Smiling at everything? At least they didn't plug in Jessica Chastain, that would not have been credible opposite Donovan's shlubby character. A performance as flat as one of those pancakes in the big American breakfast he never ate. The youth are not at this movie, they're all out to see the latest vampire/zombie/Tom Cruise dreck. So the boomers out to see an ennobling patriotic drama have lived through all this, including "duck and cover" and the Missile Crisis. Do those of us who actually were terrorized and traumatized by all that really need pedantic little lessons about the bombs and the sirens, delivered by Donovan's delusional little genius son? I found it insulting. Of course, all the Russians are scene-chewing geeky monsters, sometimes in such close-up we can see the beet-bits in their teeth. Gosh, it was cold in that Cold War! So we have to see everyone blowing and wiping their noses, boogers hanging, in order to get the idea? Exception: Mark Rylance, the only great thing about the movie. I've been watching Rylance in "Wolf Hall," and it's very impressive how he can create such a level of charismatic tension by hardly doing anything at all. He's all stillness, posture, little eye movements and gazes, all restrained, all coiled in. Amazing. Back to the thriller at hand. So in the big spectacle scene where the U2 gets shot down, did Spielberg really need to show off, proving "Oh, I can do 'Gravity,' I can do 'The Walk'" just for bragging cred? And is it actually historically true that Powers gripped on to edge of his crumbling cockpit and just failed to hit the destruct button before his tether broke? (OH! is that a sneaky symbolic allusion to 'aborting' a mission?) This whole thing could have been done as a 15-minute documentary (not that I'd like seeing another documentary) rather than puffed up into a dry and predictable "drama. When we see Hanks' character lying face down on his bed at home because he's so beat, I suppose if I were him I'd be concerned to hide my face for having accepted another such stereotypical heroic individual little man role. Do nasty CIA agents really skip into the air in peevish excitement like an 11-year old when they get frustrated? (Oh, they probably do.) It might have been more exciting to get into a row with the dopey woman in the seats behind us who kept aggravating my wife by kneeing and bumping the back of her seat - but "Would it help?" So the Coen brothers helped write this. I guess Spielberg thought it might be more tasty to shmear some funky mustard on this baloney sandwich, but "Would it help?" My fantasy is that the Coens were often snickering up their sleeves.Cold War Propaganda A new film set in the Cold War era of the 1950's was released a few weeks ago and is apparently a big hit. The plot revolves around James B. Donovan, a simple lawyer who is chosen to defend Colonel Rudolf Abel, a captured Soviet spy, in the midst of an atmosphere of anti-communist hysteria sweeping the US. Later in the movie Mr. Donovan is recruited by CIA to negotiate the release of captured American spies in exchange for Colonel Abel, including U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers who was captured by the Soviets after his spy plane was shot down in Soviet airspace. The tortured tagline of the film sums up the propaganda point to be driven home: "In the shadow of war, one man showed the world what we stand for." What we (the US) stand for is supposedly a just and humane society where everyone, even a communist spy, is entitled to a fair trial. This is set against the supposed tyranny and cruelty of communist states. However, the version of events presented in this film and the case it attempts to make in favor of an American system of "fair play" can easily be disproved. Many relevant details have been distorted or conveniently left out of the narrative. Also, some facts have been included but presented out of any historical context. Unfortunately, most Americans will passively accept this false narrative without question or without doing any further study of their own. They will accept the movie as being a true recounting of historical events. I could now spend a lot of time discussing every single propaganda element within the film such as the dark and gloomy atmosphere in East Berlin; the scowling faces of the East German border guards; the menacing and hostile demeanor of various communist officials or scenes of torture, but I have decided to take a different approach. I will simply tell the truth of the historical incident that this film is supposedly based on; and I will do it using the memoirs of the two primary American participants in these events - James Donovan and Francis Powers. Let's start by comparing the details and outcomes of the Abel trial in the US with that of Powers' trial in the Soviet Union. Both spies were caught red-handed and so there could be no doubt as to their guilt in both cases. Therefore, the purpose of the trials should have been simply to gather all the facts available in an effort to come up with a suitable punishment to fit the crime. Below, I have included a table that shows the results of each trial. Powers (Soviet trial) Abel (US trial) Held Incommunicado 4 weeks 3 weeks Phys. or Psych. Abuse No Yes Max. Poss. Sentence Death (rare cases) Death (very common) Actual Sentence 10 years 30 years Powers stated in his autobiography, written a decade after his return to the US, that he did not suffer any abuse during his captivity in the Soviet Union. Abel, however, said that during his interrogation he was struck in the face by one of the FBI agents who grew frustrated at his silence and refusal to cooperate. Powers was told by the Soviets that execution for espionage was rare in the USSR, but Abel was informed that the death penalty was very likely to be his fate. In fact, just a few years prior to Abel's trial in 1957, the Rosenbergs had been sent to the electric chair for stealing atomic secrets for the Soviet Union. Finally, in the sentences that were eventually handed down, Powers received a relatively light 10 years imprisonment while Abel was given 30 years. The Soviets were accused of subjecting Powers to a "show trial," but this is exactly what the Americans did with Rudolf Abel. As it turns out, despite all the blather about the high ideals of the American legal system, Donovan and his co-conspirators were really just concerned with promoting the idea of superior values of American "fair play," without any regard for the substance behind such claims. Furthermore, the real reason Mr. Donovan argued to save Abel's life was in order to hold him as a bargaining chip in the inevitable event of a spy swap with the Soviets down the road. Mr. Donovan, the humble lawyer, was actually a high-ranking career spy. He admits in his memoirs that at the time he was supposed to be impartially defending Colonel Abel, he was at that moment still a spook! In his own words he reveals that he "still held a commission as a commander in Naval Intelligence." Prior to that he had worked as head legal counsel in the OSS (precursor to the CIA) for several years and had helped to organize the CIA after WWII! However, from the insane viewpoint of American exceptionalism nothing here is out of place, but if this film had been done from the Soviet perspective (taking into account the undeniable facts of the incident), the plot might go like this: The US violates Soviet airspace repeatedly until one of their spy planes is finally shot down. The pilot, despite his refusal to denounce the criminal activity of his government, receives a very light sentence in comparison to America's treatment of captured Soviet agents. Some time later, a CIA spymaster shows up in East Berlin demanding the release of three American spies in exchange for one Soviet spy. Although this naturally strikes the Soviets as unfair, due to their good nature they agree. Colonel Abel returns home to a hero's welcome while Francis Powers is received with suspicion, denounced by the media and much of the American public as a traitor, and is held incommunicado by the CIA for "debriefing" for nearly a month.

The plot is about ace lawyer Tom Hanks (his screen name does not really matter, since the movie is just star performance) who is going to prove how good he is, both to the Russians and the East-Germans. A rather puffy-faced Hanks is in most scenes, playing a smug and arrogant lawyer, who always gets the last word and whatever he wants. His performance as a the lawyer is rather overbearing and even slightly unpleasant, but the public still liked him a lot and laughed at all his one-liners (again, star performance, rather than good plot or script). The spies or would-be spies featured in the movie are: 1) a sour little man, who speaks with what sounded to me an Irish accents and who was supposed to be funny with his unflappability. He repeats "Would it help if I worry?" countless times, every time getting a laugh 2) a rather dumb American pilot and 3) another sort of heroic American student, getting mixed up with foreign politics, when he'd better stayed at home. They all seem to be just props to give Hanks a chance to shine. The moral of the story should be that all countries should be better off minding their own business. However, this sound unrealistic, so the moral is that American heroes (especially Tom Hanks) always save the day. Mind the overbearing soundtrack that seems to come straight out "Saving private Ryan"Disappointingly shallow and poorly acted out Hanks, Alda, Spielberg, the Coen brothers. What can go wrong? Apparently, quite a lot. Strengths first: the meticulous recreation of the 60's across two countries is breathtaking. The streets look 60's, the people look and talk 60's, the atmosphere is 60's. It's immersing and awe-inspiring. Now the weaknesses: 1) Lots and lots of exposition. I understand that the millenials are expected to not know the history from 50 years ago, but come on - if someone doesn't know/love history they aren't going to see this movie in the first place. Stop wasting our time with exposition. 2) Poor acting. This must be the weakest performance from Tom Hanks I've seen in years. The guy is sleep-walking through the role, and everyone else is wooden and not worth mentioning, except for Alan Alda who steals every scene he's in. Amy Ryan is just awful I'm sorry to say. 3) Too long. Way too long. Should've ended with the exchange taking place. We don't need the "happy end" through vindication - it's completely implausible too. 4) Not focused. The pilot's story is completely surplus to requirements and insignificant - it doesn't add anything to the narrative. We don't really need to see the pilot until his first scene in captivity. Instead, the time should be spent on character development of which there is absolutely none. 5) Predictable. Yes, the story is well known and we all know how it ends, but this means that the unpredictability needs to be in the nuances. The little things that aren't part of the written history. But everything is predictable, nothing is captivating. 6) The treatment of the story. The script is by the Coen brothers but it has John Le Carre written all over it. It's a classic Le Carre-like spy thriller (thriller, not action). There have been fantastic film adaptations of Le Carre, so we know it can be done. Sadly, on this occasion Spielberg fails to deliver. 4/10Missing something It was opening night, the theater was packed and I was expecting greatness. After all, this story is right in Spielberg's wheelhouse. The time period, cold war, Tom Hanks, the stars were aligned. I will start with this notion, Spielberg's movies are always well acted, always well shot and always beautifully scored. Bridge of Spies does not fail this standard. There are clearly some remarkable acting performances. It wouldn't be a surprise to see some trophies handed out for this work. The director got what he needed, superb acting. The actors did not get what they need, superb story telling. It is the only thing missing here but it's a biggie.  If you know anything about the real life story of James Donovan you could easily imagine a truly exciting movie. The opening credit sequence included this line...Based on Real Events. This disclaimer gives license to the director to "Hollywood up" the story. So basically there are no excuses. In Munich, the director pealed your sole with great story telling, tension and acting. Bridge of Spies had that potential, at least, that's what I was expecting. Tension was left out of this movie for some reason. I theorize Spielberg did this intensionally. Why? Somebody should ask him.Dull and boring. This movie is long, stagy, pretentious and boring. The acting is hammy, and the characters are drab and inspire little interest. The tension should have been gripping. Instead it is absent. The ending of movie is already known and is anti-climatic. The movie seems to suggest that Abel was not treated fairly and downplays the seriousness of his crimes and the sinister nature of his work. The treatment of Francis Gary Powers is completely superficial, which makes the story even weaker. For an audience not familiar with the history surrounding Abel and Powers, this movie will not make any sense at all. This movie contains no heroes, heroines, no damsels in distress, none of the stock characters and situations usually employed to give a story some substance. Instead, the movie just plods along to its foregone conclusion. Why would any movie maker find such bland characters worthy of a movie? The real story is how the Soviets managed to shoot down an American spy plane flying at 70,000 feet. How the Soviets were able to detect and target a U2 flying at that altitude is not explained, nor is the huge political fallout caused by the Powers debacle even mentioned. Indeed, the names of Eisenhower and Khrushchev are absent, yet in the actual event they were the key players, and by leaving them out, there's no story.Mr Smith goes to a bridge I am a Cold War child, born in a country which did have common borders with a Warsaw Pact member but was never a target of thermonuclear destruction. I was still at primary school when I came across a couple of serialized excerpts from Powers' memoir. He really caught my imagination. I saw "The Spy Who Came in from the Cold" and "Across the Bridge" (with Rod Steiger), films in which the bridge is both the passage and the frontier, a no-man's land in which destinies can be decided in a split second of hesitation or bad luck. Bridge of Spies was a great disappointment. Cars and costumes were fine but the spirit and the people of the era was absent. I don't understand why, when I think of "Munich" or "Schindler's List", when there are so many novels to consult for the atmosphere and so many memoirs to consult for the facts. Why was Powers pictured with such unkind shallowness? Why were CIA men and DDR functionaries such caricatures? No matter how great Mark Rylance was, where was the motivation and the ideology of the Soviet spy? Where were the political leaders of the two superpowers? How did the little lawyer from the Bronx become such a cool operative behind the lines, from one day to the other, without experiencing any fear or trepidation? There is nothing wrong with high morals or nostalgia in cinema but when a film tries to portray an episode from a complex political and ideological conflict serving only these ingredients, then I can only be disappointed at the waste of means and opportunities. Pity.very bad fake this is a silly and stupid set of stamps and manifestation of an inferiority complex from a lack of knowledge. In the film, the mass of historical and factual errors, and the film is not a history of the spy Rudolf Abel and his exchange on pilot Francis Gary Powers, and a pretentious propaganda picture. It all started back in the Spielberg movie "Terminal", but in this movie took a truly catastrophic proportions. Spielberg does not have a clue about life in the USSR and the GDR, and all of his view of life in these countries is based on a picture of the American propaganda magazines and newspapers of the time (ie, during the Cold War. Who started the United States and its allies, and the Warsaw Pact was created as a response against the NATO alliance. And the plan of offensive war in Europe, originally did not belong to the Soviet Union and the United States and the United Kingdom). If you are interested in the history of flying spy plane U-2 over the Soviet Union and the subsequent exchange of Francis Gary Powers to the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, see the Soviet movie "Dead Season". It is much better to do than this fake of Spielberg. In addition, in this old Russian movie authentic costumes, interiors and uniforms of the period. Unlike Spielberg film in which nothing is authentic, except for helmets GDR Army. By the way, Francis Gary Powers voluntarily told all in captivity, without tortures and horrors in "Spilberg style". Upon returning to the US, he was accused that not blew himself up along with the aircraft at ejection (under catapult CIA profit laid an explosive charge) and that did not take the poisoned needle for suicide (Francis Powers voluntarily gave the needle during the arrest). If you interesting to see a movie about Powers, watch Soviet movie "We accuse" (1985). As far as I know, in the United States was no movie about Francis Gary Powers. Although he fulfilled his soldier duty to the end, and died like a hero - rescuing children from falling helicopter. This movie - 0 from 10.Very disappointing I personally felt this film was not to my taste. I went in expecting a nice meaty courtroom drama. Turned out it was something else entirely. Something bereft of any drama at all, really. This film is about a man who faces numerous obstacles that he needs to overcome in order to do the right thing. The problem is that each time he comes across an obstacle turns out all he has to do is simply ask someone to remove it for him! And for some reason they do it for him! Every single time! He does this over and over again throughout the film. It's ridiculous. If he can simply ask for whatever wants then there is nothing at stake. There is never any tension.  I wish I had not wasted my money. And I wish I had instead sat at home watching a tin of beans heat up in a microwave. And because everyone knows you can't put metal things in a microwave, it would have at least provided more drama and more tension than the entirety of this very long and very boring film.*Yawn* It's very slow, but still brilliant to say the least.Exclellent Movie - More Excellent Country Than Now This review may be a spoiler if you don't know the real history and haven't seen the movie. This an inspired depiction of the 1960's exchange of a Russian Spy captured by the United States and then traded for our spy captured by the Soviets. The movie is excellent and a sparkling story with superb acting that moves along whether you know what happened or you don't. Tom Hanks is at his best portraying a private attorney requested by the US Government to negotiate the exchange as a private person not a government employee. It gets quite tense at times and I understood it better the second time I viewed it. I gave it a 10. What struck me, and why I am writing this review, is the difference in our country then compared to now. Then we were all patriotic and it was USA first. It is not so now. Now we have many people who refuse to stand for the National Anthem. I liked our country better then than now. Actually I am disgusted at the behavior now. If you are interested as why, check on the NFL.Good film of Cold War true events "Bridge of Spies" is a first rate film about three true events that occurred at the height of the Cold War (1946-1991). They were headline news stories of their day. The first two incidents were unrelated but were tied together by the third event. Director Steven Spielberg and the writing team had a tough job condensing three stories over five years into a film of less than 2¬Ω hours. They had to skip much detail, and the film seems crammed in places. Some things may not be apparent to one who doesn't know the history.  The first event was the 1957 New York arrest, trial and conviction of Rudolf Abel, a Soviet spy. The second event was the 1960 crash of an American spy plane over Russia and the arrest, trial and conviction of the pilot, Francis Gary Powers. The third event was the 1962 prisoner exchange of the two men, along with a second American. The first and last of these three events involve a third principal character, James Donovan, a New York attorney. The film revolves around Donovan and his role in the lives of the captive men.  All of the cast are superb in their roles. The film naturally had Hollywood treatment, so some parts are fiction. Folks interested in the Cold War, or in espionage, or Soviet spying in particular, might enjoy more details. So, I offer some here from my study of these subjects.  Rudolf Abel was one of many aliases of Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (1903-1971). Fisher was an English-born Russian. He moved to Russia in the 1920s, served in the military and became a Soviet intelligence officer. After World War II, he joined the KGB and was trained to spy in the U.S. He left Russia in 1948. Using different IDs and passports, he made his way across Europe to Canada and then the U.S. on Nov. 17. He operated in a spy ring under the code name, Mark. When things heated up, he was about to leave the U.S. with a new ID. But, he was arrested before he could leave. That was June 21, 1957. The film gives a sense of intrigue with Abel's capture. It didn't happen the way the movie portrays it. He answered the door in his hotel room and was arrested by FBI agents. But the scenes with a hollow nickel were one way to bring into the story a real aspect that led to Abel's capture. In 1953, a Brooklyn newspaper boy received a hollow nickel for payment when he was collecting for his paper route. He dropped the coin and it popped open, revealing a piece of microfilm. It wound up in the hands of the FBI. In time, through trailing other known Soviet spies, and the defection of one in May of 1957, the feds were able to corral Abel.  The federal court in New York convicted him of spying and sentenced him to 30 years in prison. He had served just over four years in an Atlanta prison, when he was exchanged in 1962 for Gary Powers. Back home in Russia, Fisher lectured on his experiences until he died at age 68 in 1971. Francis Gary Powers (1929-1977) was a U.S. Air Force jet pilot during 1952-56. He was discharged from the Air Force as a captain in 1956, and went to work for the CIA to fly U-2 missions over the Soviet Union. Those began on Sept. 27, 1956 and continued into 1960. On May 1 of that year, Powers was shot down by a new Soviet ground to air missile, and parachuted to safety. On Aug. 19, the Soviet Union convicted him of espionage and sentenced him to three years in prison and seven years of hard labor. He served just over 21 months in prison before the February 10, 1962 exchange. The movie doesn't show it, but the Powers family and two American attorneys were at his trial. In later years, Powers received honors for his service. Soviet records released after the fall of the Iron Curtain verified the details Power had given of his U-2 flight. Powers died on Aug. 1, 1977 when his TV traffic helicopter crashed in Los Angeles. While making an emergency landing, he swerved to avoid hitting children playing in a park.  James Donovan (1916-1970) took the Abel case after several others had turned it down. He had been in a private law firm just seven years after serving as a commander in the Navy. During World War II, he was associate counsel in a research and development office. After the war, he was assistant to Justice Robert H. Jackson, the chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg war trials in Germany. Donovan was the main negotiator in the prisoner exchange of Abel and Powers, which also included an American student, Frederic Pryor.  While the movie doesn't cover it, Donovan's efforts that same year and the next for Cuban exiles were as harrowing as his negotiations with the Soviets. In June, exiled Cubans asked him to negotiate the release of the Cuban Americans captured by Fidel Castro after the failed April 17, 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The negotiations concluded on July 3, 1963, and led to the release of about 1,100 people. Donovan was just 53 years old when he died of a heart attack in January 1970.  A 1976 TV movie was made about Gary Powers. Lee Majors starred in "Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident." A 1948 movie, "The Iron Curtain," stars Dana Andrews as Igor Gouzenko. He was a Soviet crypto clerk who defected and exposed a massive spy network in Canada and the U.S. The Soviets were way ahead of the U.S. in their espionage work after WW II and during the early years of the Cold War.Query - Rylance 's Oscar. I enjoyed this movie more than I thought would - Tom Hanks is his usual brilliant self and Spielberg directs this really well. My only problem is with Mark Rylance getting an Oscar for his turn as Abel the Soviet spy. He always underplays and I personally do not rate his acting talents at all. He is so laid back as to be almost horizontal. It is, by its subject, a very talky movie but it is well written and none of the talk is wasted time. It is absorbing and interesting about a time when I had little interest in world politics. It all makes sense to me now.From Brooklyn to Berlin ***MILD SPOILERS***True story of the capture conviction and later exchange of Soviet master spy Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance, who was caught in his Brooklyn hotel room by the FBI trying to relay,in a hollowed out US nickel,a secret documents to his Soviet controllers back in 1957. What seemed like an open and shut case of espionage Abel was given insurance lawyer James B. Donovan, Tom Hanks, to represent him to show the world as well as the hated Soviet Union that he was to get a fair trial before he's to be executed or at least sent away for life for his crimes. Donovan really takes his job as well as the US Constatution seriously and defends Abel to the best of his ability only to have his client convicted and given a 30 year sentence which to many Americans seems like a slap on the wrist: That's after the Rosenbergs were executed for the very same crimes that Abel was convicted of some five years earlier. With Abel locked away in federal prison in Georgia and Donoven appealing his conviction US Air Force pilot Francis Gary Powers,Austin Stowell, is shot down with his U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union on of all days May 1-May or Workers Day in the USSR-1960 giving Abel a lifeline for an early out by the US Government who's ready to exchange him for Powers. It was Powers who against orders didn't end up killing himself with a cyanide tipped needle before he was captured by the Russians alive that exposed him as a US spy not a weather man as the US Government claimed he was. With Donovan still Abel's lawyer he's told by his government to negotiate Abel's release in exchange for Powers who's been given a three year sentence, a lot less the Abel was given by the US courts ,behind bars as well as seven years house arrest-In the Moscow Hilton- by the Soviet peoples court. It's with all this going on a love sick American collage student Fred Pryor played by Will Rogers?, not the one you think it is but someone else, is busted by the Communist East German police in trying to get his German girlfriend out of the city of divided Berlin before it's walled up by the East German police as well as military. With the US more then willing to let the totally innocent Pryor hang-by his you know what's- but only wanting to get Powers, who in fact was spying on the USSR, freed Donovan makes it a point to get both Pryor as well as Donovan freed or else he just won't cooperate with his string pullers in both the State Department and Pentagon. ***MILD SPOILERS SINCE HISTORY ALREADY SHOWED US WHAT HAPPENED***Donovan prevailed in the end getting both Powers as well as Pryor freed for the return of Rudolf Able in a nail biting exchange on the Berlin Gilenicke Bridge with out as much as a shot, in anger or celebration, being fired. Donvovan who was hated and called a dirty Commie by almost everyone who knew him is now a hero not only by getting Powers and Pryor back but later getting over 9,000 Cuban freedom fighters and their families back to freedom after being captured and arrested by Castro's troops in the disastrous "Bay of Pigs" invasion of Communist Cuba in 1961. As for Francis Gary Powers the main man in this movie he never was given the respect that he deserved in him not killing himself before the Commies or Russans captured him thus exposing the entire U-2 spy operations to the world at large. And putting the US, who up until then said it was national policy not to spy on anyone, the self proclaimed "Good Guys of the Free World" in a bad light.Well done Well-acted, well-written, well-directed, well-produced. Spielberg and the Coen brothers take an interesting episode in world history and craft a compelling, dramatic story.  About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it. My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of "terrible", with 5 being "mediocre" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A Classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating)Getting across the wall Bridge of Spies is a pedestrian cold war drama that combines the talents of Steven Spielberg and the Coen brothers. It really is a literal title as the climax takes place on a bridge and it has spies. Tom Hanks plays an insurance lawyer. We are meant to root for him even though as he tries to stiff a personal injury lawyer. Remember folks, his insured driver injured five people but he wants to limit it as one claim. Hanks really has the hang of these types of characters now, sturdy, steady, steadfast with just a hint of overacting. He plays James Donovan who is called in to defend Rudolf Abel a captured KGB spy operating in the USA. He places his life at risk to save him from the death penalty, being astute enough to realise that Abel may become useful in later years. So it does when the Russians capture a U-2 spy plane pilot. Donovan then has to put his personal safety at risk by going to East Germany to negotiate a spy swap. The film features a critically acclaimed performance from Mark Rylance who plays Abel and won a best supporting actor Oscar. Rylance is an example of a subtle, understated performance. Spielberg is a master craftsman but the film is just too cumbersome and stuffy. It never has the labyrinthic thrills of a John Le Carre story. There is some wonderful art direction but the film really needed some zap.***1/2 Someone will have to explain to me why Mark Rylance won the best supporting Oscar award for this very good film, especially in a year where Sylvester Stallone was well favored to garner the award. That being said, this was a very good film showing the efforts of a Brooklyn lawyer in going to Europe to secure the swap of Rudolph Ivanovich Abel, a Russian spy with Gary Francis Powers, the latter getting caught during the U-2 Spy Incident during the waning years of the Eisenhower administration. Hanks, as the attorney, is relentless that the swap must include the economics student who was studying in East Germany at the wrong time. The film showed the break that there was between East Germany and the Soviet Union.OK story, but too long and too slow This is a movie about spies during the cold war. Main problem was the movie was well over 2 hours with not enough excitement or tension. Plot is Rudolf Abel is arrested for being a Russian spy, I guess he was but never really admits it. Tom Hanks plays James his lawyer. When an US pilot gets captured by the Russians, James makes a play to trade Rudolf for him. He does the dangerous work of even going to Berlin and meeting with Russian and German officials. He learns of a US student whom has been arrested in Berlin, so going against what he's told, he tries to bargain for the student also. So of course the 2 sides have issues, but in the end James is able to negotiate the release of both US detainees.  FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, but only watch it if you got a lot of time on your hands.Good Entertainment if You Don't Need Historical Accuracy or Reality We enjoyed this movie on a purely entertainment level. If you don't have to have historical accuracy and logic, this will do for that. The movie is filled with mucho movie clich√©s, for example, a dark stormy, rainy night to set the anxious scene for the shady CIA agent following Tom Hanks, cold blizzardy snow to set the East Germany post war gloom and danger, mean/cold/evil CIA agents, a judge that doesn't care about following proper legal proceedings, WW II era German soldiers, cold and calculating Soviets, 1950's innocence in America, Commie hating Americans, unquestioning allegiance to the Military, and of course everything has to be based on a time deadline and come down to a happy ending at the last moment. The first part of the movie made me uncomfortable because of its historical inaccuracy and exaggerations. Once I stopped looking for accuracy and reality as necessities, I settled down to just being entertained.  Gary Powers clinging to his spinning out of control U-2 was both exciting and silly. A person attached to an out of control airplane that was falling at +400 mph would be torn apart. I believe the historically accurate story was less exciting. Gary Powers ejected after his plane was hit, failed to destroy the aircraft and take his suicide pill, and was captured, to the embarrassment of the U.S. The movie takes a long time to move through the story that we know has to have a happy ending. It's filled with almost there, then failure, then almost there again. That's the main pattern of the telling. Tom Hanks is always Tom Hanks, no matter who he plays these days. He's no longer the intense actor we saw in "Big", "Forrest Gump", "Cast Away", or his other blockbuster masterpieces.  The overall theme of the story was a good one. Spying was considered a necessary part of the Cold War, and both sides denying that they were spying was part of the game. History loses something in the telling.An interesting story but it's one that is imbalanced and poorly structured (minor spoilers) James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is a lawyer who practices in 'insurance' law, but when he's tasked with defending Soviet spy and traitor Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) it proves to be a case that is not only career-defining for Donovan, but one that is also life-changing as well. Bridge Of Spies was a film that did hold my interest and have me gripped (up until the conclusion of Abel's trial). However, from this point on, at least as far as I was concerned, it gradually became less and less interesting.... The first problem lies with how the film has been structured - Bridge Of Spies is a film that runs for over 2 hours, but in those 2 + hours the film essentially only has two threads hanging it together (Abel's trial and the exchange of prisoners). What you get here is about 45 minutes of trial and about 90 minutes of Donovan's various conversations with government officials. As I've said the first third of it is OK, but the final two thirds of the picture are repetitive and rather dull and it quickly becomes evident that the prisoner exchange aspect of the story does not necessitate 90 minutes worth of screen time. The next issue lies with how imbalanced the whole film feels; as I've said great portions of the film are spent on both Abel's trial and on Donovan's wonderful negotiating skills in effecting the prisoner exchanges, but Spielberg and his team of scriptwriters (2 of whom are the Coen brothers) seem to overlook other aspects of the film such as what happened to Abel whilst he was in the US? What happened to Powers when he was captured in Russia? What happened to the American student whilst he was held in Germany? Spielberg sets all these plot points up on an assembly line, but doesn't delve deeper into any of these plot points which at times means that the film lacks depth and insight. I was particularly disappointed that Powers didn't factor as prominently in the story considering that he was quite an important character. Rylance won an Oscar for his performance here which I personally found a bit puzzling (yes he's OK, but I didn't really see anything brilliant about his performance). Hanks again is OK but he generally gives a fairly stock 'everyman' performance which isn't that big a stretch for him. When all is said and done I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed by Bridge Of Spies; to me it put too much focus in some areas and not enough focus in other areas which resulted in an imbalanced and poorly structured film. I think the best way to summarise it would be 'interesting subject matter that was poorly delivered.'Spy Chase Spielberg Style Although very good to look at and mostly continually interesting (while maybe a little over length) this bridge may not hold as much weight as it could have. I suppose we should know what we can expect with Spielberg at the helm. While I agree this is one of his better movies, it still offers the usual over exaggerated bits just to liven up the action - while some facts get overlooked for the sake of 'entertainment'. We don't get to know anything about the character the whole show is built around - not even what his bit of folded paper was all about, so have to assume this was perhaps mocked-up to hold our interest. Mr Hank's wife is just a bit too difficult to believe - especially her reaction after their home and family get shot up!- then again, with that whole segment being a fabricated beat-up (this looks like Cohen Bros stuff) I guess it also fits in with the way Hollywood saw 50's women.  It's mostly good based on fact dramatic entertainment with an element of fanciful trimmings - what more could be expected of a Spielberg/Cohen partnership?. Another positive comes in the way Award winner Marc Rylance as Abel (the spy) and Tom Hanks as his defense, perfectly bounce words and glances off each other.Boring to Death!!! During the Cold War, an American lawyer is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers. I never thought that i would ever watch a Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks movie and get so goddamn bored i really lost my interest after 30 minutes and Mark Rylance? He wasn't even that great to begin with and it amazes me how he even won that Oscar instead of Stallone who was magnificent in Creed. Tom Hanks is as great as always but the boring pacing it just ruins the whole movie and the audience's experience and to be honest i had more fun with Indiana Jones 4 than this.A bridge too far. Spielberg's latest film, Bridge of Spies ends up being about exactly that. A bridge in Berlin where captured spies are swapped from east to west. And the hero of the piece, played by Tom Hanks, is the one good American who will win the day and save the participants. And that is where my least favourite trope of a Spielberg film comes out. There's no denying that Spielberg is a good filmmaker and a master storyteller. I just wish that he wouldn't allow his sentimentality to subvert the real subjects of his movies. What Bridge of Spies should be about, and briefly is, are the two contrasting spies in this mostly true story. The film opens with Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) being captured. It's made clear that there is no question of his guilt. The government doesn't want anything to do with the defence, so attorney James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is randomly assigned to the case. Its then that you get to see the performance of Rylance dominate in his sessions with Donovan. Seemingly non-plussed, Abel doesn't seem to care about his fate and Rylance brings a real sense of eccentricity and intelligence to his character. The trial is stacked against him, with zero chance of an acquittal and that's when the film started to lose my interest. Minutes are devoted to the actual trial and the viewer is left to wonder about the nature of the evidence and the drama of the case. I hoped to learn more about the psychology of spydom, and Rylance has the nuance to reveal it. Ultimately, the character remains an unknowable cipher. But it's deemed unimportant because Spielberg has bigger fish to fry. Namely, after the conviction, the suggestion by Donovan that in lieu of sentencing, Abel may be used as a trade for an American spy being held by the Soviets. This turns out to be U.S. air pilot Francis Gary Powers, shot down over Soviet air space while on a reconnaissance mission. His guilt isn't in question either, but unlike Abel, we don't get to know too much about Powers other than the fact that he is young and handsome. His instructions were to blow up his plane and commit suicide if he is captured, neither of which he does. It's difficult to care about his fate, particularly with his actions remaining unquestioned. He seems more pawn than spy. So the trade seems unbalanced. The second half of the movie shifts the focus almost completely to Donovan and his mission to make the spy swap in Berlin. We get an hour or so of stereotypical, and in some cases ridiculous agents and diplomats of the East German and Soviet variety. And this is where Spielberg really shows his hand. He uses Hanks for his Jimmy Stewart quality as an aw shucks, righteous man who not only manages the swap, but gets an extra prisoner, an American student held in East Berlin. We've been prepared for this since the start with scenes that show what a good husband and father he is, a sympathetic and kind lawyer, and, it seems, the only character with a pure agenda. So by the end, the film becomes a flag waving tribute to the decency of a simple, honest man. Forrest Gump does d√©tente.Excellent and often very absorbing film, without being one of Spielberg's finest 'Bridge of Spies' had much going for it, mainly that it's based on a very interesting story, Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance are talented actors with some very noteworthy performances and when in his prime Steven Spielberg directed some of the most relentlessly entertaining and entertaining films in cinema. While 'Bridge of Spies' is not one of Spielberg's finest films, in the way 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'ET', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Empire of the Sun', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'Jurassic Park' are, for me despite its flaws along with 'Lincoln' and 'War Horse' (remember liking 'Munich' a lot too, though it needs a re-watch) it's one of his better ones since 'AI'. There is not an awful lot wrong with 'Bridge of Spies', though due to the subject matter it's not going to appeal to all tastebuds. To me, it's biggest problem was pacing. By all means not a continuous problem, because there was enough in the film that was really engaging, but parts do drag and not every scene felt like it was needed. The beginning is notably draggy and the film could easily have ended after the climactic scene on the bridge, because the ending did feel unnecessarily stretched and was particularly guilty of the sappiness and over-sentimentality that Spielberg is often criticised for. Similarly Donovan's family scenes could have been excised with no problem, they add very little and their cloying nature did feel too much and misplaced within the rest of the film. The only other problem was Thomas Newman's score, it's nicely composed and it fits at least (to have it used sparingly was also a good move in order to not distract from the atmosphere and dialogue) but there is nothing hugely memorable or anything to go wow over or that evokes any strong emotions. Not bad as such, just bland. However, 'Bridge of Spies', as always with Spielberg is incredibly well-made, as well as directed with a lot of class. It is sumptuously shot and the period detail is elegant, atmospheric and positively eye catching, especially the scenes in Berlin where you actually feel the cold, austerity and tension. While there is a lot of talk in 'Bridge of Spies', the script is thought-provoking and tightly structured, not making the mistake of being rambling, using complicated jargon or being too wordy. There is even some nice knowing witty humour that gives the film some freshness and is well-incorporated when it appears, while the political and patriotic elements avoid being preachy. While the pace is not completely secure and not every scene felt necessary, the story is very absorbing and is told with intelligence, tension and emotion. While there is perhaps not enough on the trial, that part is very intriguingly done, while the Berlin scenes that dominate the film have a lot of tension and suspense. The shift from America to Berlin is handled well and not too crudely, a very easy thing to do when visually and atmospherically their scenes are so different. The characters are engagingly written on the most part, with the exception of Donovan's family (his wife in particular is the typical nurturing but frustrated clich√© with little variation on it). Donovan is one of those characters that holds the narrative together as strong as a rock and is easily rootable, while Abel comes close to being the most sympathetic character while at the same time evoking some chills. The chemistry between the two characters is very strongly done. All the acting is very good (though Amy Ryan barely registers in the role that gives her very little to work with), with Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance being outstanding. Hanks is effortlessly commanding and has such a great cool charisma, essential for a lead role that is on screen for almost the whole duration. Despite his screen time being much less, Rylance portrays Abel with quiet understated dignity, with his expressions and eyes speaking every bit as much as when he's delivering his lines, that comes over both chillingly and heart-wrenchingly. All in all, excellent and often very absorbing. 7.5/10 Bethany CoxBridge of Spies displays a lot of patriotism, character, and love for your enemies. Bridge of Spies had an amazing display of sincere and authentic care for your enemies. The display of love for your enemies in this movie is a great example of who we are supposed to be in Christ when we struggle to do the right thing against our sin nature. For when we love our enemies, our friends may hate us for it, but we can be assured in who we are in Christ by not backing down in our character and convictions even if the crowd demands our head. In the Bible in Matthew 5:43-45 it says, "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven." Character is also greatly displayed in Donovan's character throughout the movie. For example when the American government asks Donovan to violate attorney client privilege defending an accused Russian spy on American soil, Donovan refuses quoting the constitution and stays true to his client and character. Bridge of Spies is a great movie filled with true patriotism.Cheap CGI and predictable plot Spielberg has done it again: After the lame and shameful CGI in Indy 4, Bridge of Spies returns with some terrible CGI of a plummeting plane so lame that makes the fake plastic baby form American Sniper a masterpiece.  The movie is OK, but it's flat and predictable: **SPOILER HERE** A brilliant lawyer (Hanks) defends a soviet spy and works his ways not to send him to the electric chair in case 'someday' a US pilot is caught by the soviets and there's a need to exchange them both. What happens a minute later? You guessed right: A US pilot is held prisoner (the one in the cheap CGI plane) and Tom Hanks is in charge of the exchange. Tadaaah.  Also a US student is held prisoner just because, but Tom Hanks manages to free them both after 3 long hours of chit chat and blurry backgrounds thanks to the cheap CGI that fills every corner of the movie.Interesting but somewhat draggy To start off, Tom Hank's acting was spot on. He played the character James Donovan well, and the film as a whole allows us to root for him and to feel what he feels, even though everyone looks down on him for his ideals. Mark Rylance's character (Rudolf Abel) was dry in my opinion, although there were small moments where he shined.  The plot as a whole was interesting, but the movie's progress felt somewhat slow. Was it to build up tension? I'd guess so, though I didn't feel it and I was always waiting for more to happen (to no avail, until the finale). The movie could have been shortened to an hour an a half, in my humble opinion. Perhaps it is somewhat due to the relatively simple and short main plot.  Not an absolute must watch in my opinion. I'm sorry but I expected so much more.  6/10Spielberg Can Make Even the Cold War Maudlin I thought that the Coen brothers as co-screenwriters of "Bridge of Spies" meant that we might get some restraint and intelligence to balance the maudlin platitudes that almost certainly come attached with a Steven Spielberg film. But I was wrong. Spielberg takes a chilly Cold War setting and then proceeds to pump sentimentality into it until by the end it's as sunny and warm as a Folgers coffee commercial. Tom Hanks, as usual, does his best to calm Spielberg down, and plays the main character as an every man Joe trying to do the right thing despite Spielberg's attempts to cram his heroics down our throats. But by the film's end, he's as overwhelmed by the rest of us by Spielberg's schmaltz, served with healthy doses of the requisite pounding Spielbergian score, this one supplied not by John Williams but rather by Thomas Newman. Mark Rylance won an Oscar for playing a Russian spy who barely speaks, and I suppose I appreciated his ability to convey emotions without histrionics, something Spielberg certainly isn't capable of. But I can't say I really see that he did anything special enough to warrant an Academy Award. The Coens were nominated for their script, which they co-wrote with Matt Charman, and the film also copped nominations for Best Picture, Production Design, Original Score, and Sound Mixing. Grade: B-An exciting film which however varies wildly from the real truth This film is an example of myth-making, whether intentional or not I do not know. There is very little chance that the U-2 spy aircraft supposedly 'shot down' in 1960 by the Soviets in the notorious 'U-2 Incident' was really shot down at all. The various existing stories significantly contradict each other. The Russians say they fired one S-75 Dvina missile, but two different internet sites say that seven or thirteen missiles were fired, one shooting a MIG-19 out of the sky by mistake. I do not believe that any of these stories is true. We now know that Lee Harvey Oswald insisted the plane was never really shot down, and papers released in 2012 by the CIA show that they never believed either that their own man, the young pilot Francis Gary Powers, was really shot down. So why should the film suggest that he was and perpetuate a now discredited myth? It was apparently impossible for the Soviets' S-75 missile to hit a target flying at above 70,000 feet as the U-2 was. Nor did they have the guidance and control capacity to hit the plane even if a rocket existed which could get that high with any semblance of accuracy. The film shows the plane crashing nose-downward, which contradicts the official report that it crashed nose-upwards. But it appears that the truth is it never crashed, and merely landed normally, as part of a complex and mysterious political plot. It has been suggested that this was to derail d√©tente, but that may not be the whole story. There are other ambiguities regarding Powers himself. There seems to be no certainty as to his birthplace. In the 1960s he was said to be from Pound, Virginia, but on Wikipedia it says Jenkins, Kentucky, or perhaps Burdine, Kentucky. All three places are near one another on the Kentucky-Virginia border, and I used to know the area well. In the old days, apart from Highway 23, there was nothing but dirt tracks. The region is one of the wildest and most remote in the entire Appalachians. I have spent many, many weeks there in the distant past. The area was populated almost entirely by genuine hillbillies, who lived in log cabins and still hunted with flintlock rifles. I know this because I met them as a child, entered their log cabins, and held their flintlocks. I was not allowed to fire one because the gunpowder was precious and they cast their own lead ball shot from an iron mould. But the boy who let me hold and aim his own precious flintlock, which had an immensely long barrel and had 'belonged to my great-great-great-grand-pappy', was from about 1800 or even earlier. Using it, the family got most of their wild meat. The boy told me, in words I shall never forget: 'I can shoot the head off a squirrel at a hundred yards with my flintlock.' It was from this wild area that Powers was supposed to have originated, as well as another well known and notorious CIA-linked figure. (The coincidence of two major spy figures coming from the same dot on the map is impossible.) I also knew as a child a genuine local man who told me the CIA and FBI both had a special connection with Pound, Virginia, and that he had been hired himself by the FBI to do messenger work across the South and to report regularly to Pound. When Powers died mysteriously in 1977, many people thought he had been murdered. So all of these matters are extremely murky, and we shall probably never know the real truth about any of it. As for the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, I do not know what the film's agenda is for showing him as a quiet gentle, thoughtful, and artistic man, who is repeatedly described as 'honourable'. Why also is the entire American population shown in the film as foaming-at-the-mouth McCarthyites who want to lynch Abel and Donovan? Are Soviet spies being set up as the new heroes? What is going on with this film? The idea that the supposedly naive insurance lawyer Donovan would be taken to see Allen Dulles, who would tell him he could carry out his own private negotiations with the Soviets at the height of the Cold War involving a spy and a captured pilot, is totally and outrageously ludicrous. Donovan had been part of the legal team at Nuremberg and must have had intelligence affiliations already in the 1940s. Rudolf Abel (aka Willie Fisher) appears to have been a failure as a Soviet spy in America, and it defies belief that the Soviets would exchange a high-value captured American airman for him. The suspicion is that the American and Soviet security services cooperated secretly, with or without the knowledge of their own governments, to stage these phoney events. The film does not make clear that Abel had been in jail for four years before the swap for Powers, and was hence 'old news'. The film maintains that the East Germans resented and defied the Soviets, which is absurd, since East Germany was the most supine and devoted Soviet satellite state in the entire Warsaw Pact. If the Germans had behaved as shown in the film, they would have been summarily executed. Why are we expected to swallow all this nonsense? The direction of the film by Stephen Spielberg is superb, and the performances by Tom Hanks as the lawyer Donovan and Mark Rylance as Abel are outstanding in every way. (Powers features only as a minor figure in the two parallel stories shown here, which only come together with the spy swap on the bridge in Berlin.) But how much better and more interesting the film would have been if it had been accurate, and had explored the many mysterious byways and unanswered enigmas and contradictions. Instead, it adds to the existing, enormous disinformation overload.Not bad but a bit boring I'm not really a fan of Tom Hanks but in this film, he gave a good, albeit not brilliant, performance as Donovan, who suffered public scorn to do what he thought was right. I went into this film unaware that it was based on real live events but at the end, it showed some of Donovan's accomplishments after these events and I was impressed by the number of people he saved; 9703. However in the film, I wasn't hugely impressed by Tom Hanks, although he's by no means a bad actor. Supporting actor Mark Rylance was good, perhaps better than Hanks, and had some funny moments particularly with his main phrase "Would it help?"  I'm not entirely sure if this was meant to be a funny film but it got a laugh out of the audience a fair few times. There were scenes showing Abel's indifference to his situation and Donovan had some amusing lines here and there, but it seemed that the films tone was supposed to be a bit more serious and the humorous parts ruined that slightly. That said, the funny scenes weren't bad, but would probably have been better suited to a more humorous film. There were some things I liked such as the friendship that developed between Abel and Donovan over the course of the film. Their relationship was the films strong point in my opinion. Another part that I liked was at the end, when Donovan was on the train and saw some people climbing over a fence. This links back to an earlier scene in Berlin, where some people were trying to scale a wall and got shot down, which is a good contrast between Berlin and New York. I thought the judge was a jerk and it seemed to me that he was letting his prejudice against Abel influence his decision in the courtroom, so I was glad when Donovan managed to talk him out of giving Abel the death sentence. To me, the judges behavior showed that some people can't be trusted with power, but it was nice to see that he wasn't totally corrupt, so perhaps I misjudged him.  This film had a lot of talk about negotiation and politics and since I have little interest in either - largely because I don't trust politicians - it wasn't really my kind of movie. However, I wouldn't call it a bad film. Tom Hanks has some good speeches and there's a funny line here and there, so if you like movies about what goes on behind the scenes in a war, instead of focusing on shooting and explosions, you'll probably like this film. There is a bit of shooting and blowing things up - specifically a plane used to spy on the enemy - but it's kept to a minimum, focusing mainly on Donovan's struggle to help Abel.A somewhat exciting but rather bland story of Americans helping each other Bridge of Spies is about a simple American lawyer, played by Tom Hanks, who during the 60's Cold War defends a Soviet spy, played by Mark Rylance. Hanks eventually end up in the middle of East Berlin to negotiate a trade, the Soviet spy for an American pilot. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg which means that the two heavyweights are reunited once again, the last time being in 2004 when they collaborated on The Terminal. Bridge of Spies was nominated for an Oscar, among others in the category for best picture. Mark Rylance won surprisingly for best supporting role. Bridge of Spies is a very skillfully crafted film but with such a competent director as Steven Spielberg, I wasn't expecting anything else. What really stands out with Bridge of Spies is how great they've recreated East Berlin in the 60's. The production design, the costumes and the music is indeed top class. I was curious about the story itself, but at the same time I sort of suspected it to be a pretty one-sided tale of American heroism. I was right. The fact that Bridge of Spies is told from an American perspective is not a problem, there are tons of great films told that way. The thing that bothers me is the liberties they take with the truth, just for dramatic effect. Everything can of course not be true in a film based on real events, but this film steps over the line a couple of times. An example of this is the portrayal of how the Soviet treats their prisoners just to make them look worse. The other thing that bothers me is the pacing of the film and the fact that it never really takes off. It's sort of like watching a motion picture combined with a documentary where they twist and turn the truth. Hanks spends a lot of time in East Berlin without ever really finding out anything new and vital. With its 2 hours and 20 minutes, Bridge of Spies is simply too long and could have been made on or below 2 hours. The story is however interesting and the film looks good, 6 out of 10. David Lindahl - www.filmografen.seFelt like it was directed by a committee. This is worth watching for the acting. Hanks and especially Rylance were masterful. Their characters carried the film. I kept wanting more, to hear how these honorable men, in opposite enemy camps planning to blow up the World, each doing their duty for beliefs and country, learn to know and like each other. Alas, this film hinted at the depth of their relationship but could have showed so much more. Rather, like a parasitic over-the-top twin, the movie within a movie interrupted the story. The U-2 pilot was more Millennium Falcon than Air Force, the U-2 special effects more "Gravity" than realistic high altitude ejection, and the U-2 training--OJT rather than classroom, made me laugh when humor was not intended. Some of the plot points felt gimmicky so I read up on the history after watching, and the film did take some literary license with several of the historical details. Although some were clearly worth the payoff to maintain tension, some struck me as more distracting than dramatic. The sense of place and feeling of the Cold War comes through, but don't watch this film to prep for a history test. Overall, the storytelling, pacing, and acting -- especially the two lead characters, make this well worth watching.Mostly Well-Made but Very Forgettable and a Little Slow Bridge of Spies is based on the true story of an insurance lawyer during the Cold War who is chosen to defend a Russian spy in court simply to give the man a fair trial, and he decides to take it too far. For the most part it's well presented, but it doesn't stand out as anything special.  The plot is one that I think we've all seen before. There's someone who wants to help beyond his call of duty, so he does. It's not a bad plot line, but it's not a particularly good one. It's like a superhero movie without the capes. Although Bridge of Spies is much better than most superhero movies. It's not very well-paced all the time though, and it does drag a little pretty much throughout the entire movie. I always felt myself checking the remaining run time and wondering how the movie would find enough content to compensate for its 142 minute run time. It does, though, and I think that for the most part it did it well.  The character development is just fine. Jim Donovan is just like any other main character in these kinds of movies: He wants to help people, and he overdoes it more than expected despite people not wanting him to. Other than him, there's hardly any focus on any other character, so in short, they're just fine. Nothing special, but not bad either.  The acting is just fine too. Mark Rylance, who somehow won an Oscar for his performance, is such a minor character that he barely had enough time to showcase his skills as an actor. Sure, he's important to the story, but he has barely enough screen time to really be considered all that important. This is more of a personal issue that doesn't really affect my opinion of the movie, however, and is more directed at the Oscars themselves.  Overall Bridge of Spies is a good movie. It's not fantastic, it's not great, it's just good. It's one of those movies that I just watched and will probably never watch again or think about really afterwards. It's pretty forgettable, actually. Nothing about it stood out in particular, it was just good. In the end I'd recommend this movie. Maybe you'll love it, maybe you'll hate it, and maybe you'll just like it. I can see why anyone would feel any of those ways.Topical Message is Too Profound to be Delivered So Dry and Deliberate So, more than a Decade after "The Patriot Act" and every Non Neo-Con in the Country weighed in with Loud and Convincing Arguments about "The Constitution", "The Bill of Rights", and the foundation of the Country's "American Values" at Risk, what with Torture now being called "Enhanced Interrogation Techniques", and so forth, Spielberg and His "Band of Brothers" have made a Film with the same Arguments. Everyone falling all over Themselves about this "High Moral Ground" Movie, where have you been? Tom Hanks, the Coen Brothers, and others Contribute to this A-List Film and all should be Commended for Their Contribution. Mark Rylance as Abel, the Soviet Spy (true story) Deserves His Oscar Credit. But the Nomination for Best Film of the Year by the Oscars. Hardly. The Film is Peppered with Spicy Scenes that Intrigue but Interest Wanes now and then with the Lethargic Pace and Dry Composition. The Message is Obvious but why Deliver it in such a Matter of Fact, Drawn Out, Lengthy Story that Sputters at times. This is one of those that the Parts are much Better than the Whole Thing and this Thing is surely Professional Artisism at its Highest Level, but as a Profound Picture with a Heavy Political and Topical Message. Not so much. It Misses the Mark and that is to Package the Content in a Gripping and Unforgettable Film that can not be Overlooked by the Masses. The Method that the Director and His Team chose, will Alienate Half the Audience and most likely will Never get the Encrypted Memo.Competent, unspectacular but enjoyable A well-made and acted but understated cold-war drama about the exchange of prisoners between the USA and the USSR in Germany. Tom Hanks is reliably good as the insurance lawyer James Donovan, drawn into cold-war intrigue, representing a Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in court. Mark Rylance gives a quiet, understated performance as the spy. Rylance is competent, but the performance is rather a surprising nod for an Oscar. After an American spy pilot is shot down over Soviet air space, much of the film is set in Berlin as Donovan negotiates with Soviet and East German authorities for the release of the pilot and an American student captured in East Berlin in exchange for Abel. The scene where the pilots plane is shot down, is poorly filmed with cheap special effects.  But otherwise the film is well shot with excellent period detail and atmosphere. Although some of the scenes in East Berlin verge slightly on absurd, a hint of the Coen brothers influence as screenwriters for the film. Amy Ryan is largely wasted as Donovan's wife while the early scenes detailing Abels court case feel a bit short and underdeveloped. And the final scenes fall prey to Steven Spielberg's usual twee sensibilities. But overall, the film represents a decent notch in the well worn and capable partnership between Spielberg and Hanks.A Dust-Off Slide-Solid Polit-Thriller Movie Review: "Bridge of Spies" (2015) Three years after releasing Academy-Award-nominated "Lincoln" starring Daniel Day-Lewis as 16th President of the United States, comes this Berlin-Wall building time period og early 1960s Germany screenplay atmospherically-researched by Joel &amp; Ethan Coen to the utmost attention of director Steven Spielberg, who had decided to make it a 135-Minute Polit-Drama, which no one hurts of just being clever motion picture entertainment. Leading actor Tom Hanks as capable U.S. constitution-defending Lawyer James B. Donovan, who travels to post-world-war-II Berlin, Germany in highly-visceral as moody remaining 35mm film cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and professional because accurate production design by Academy-Award-winner Adam Stockhausen, when "Bridge of Spies" already wastes his suspense feed in the first 30 minutes screening a remarkable sequence featuring supreme support actor Mark Rylance as the character Rudolf Abel, who exchanges tiny encrypted messages within only razor-sharpness' able to open split metallic coins for the precious "Intel" with regard to common park-bank placements. "Bridge of Spies" directed by Steven Spielberg is no surprise, but highly-professional, enduring as a quality motion picture, nevertheless missing the moment of truth, at least emotionally with a title-given bridge-exchange of cold-war prisoners in the final thirty minutes to no suspense-consequence of just being there. FAZIT: Picture approved (breakable)  Copyright 2018 Cinemajesty Entertainments LLCMilestone film in Steven Spielberg career Another milestone film in director Steven Spielberg's feather. This one is really a heart melting and inspirational story which based on true incidents. An attorney from USA, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) willing to take risk of his lifetime to bring the freedom for the three mistakenly captures by USA, RUSSIA &amp; GERMAN during the period of Cold War. The climax made me to cried. And the best part is that his childrens do not even know that their father is an attorney, which they thought was a fisherman or sailor until the news telecast in television. "Bridge of Spies is the true story of three extraordinary characters - William Fisher, alias Rudolf Abel, a British born KGB agent arrested by the FBI in New York City and jailed as a Soviet superspy for trying to steal America's most precious nuclear secrets; Gary Powers, the American U-2 pilot who was captured when ..."you don't seem alarmed.. Bridge Of Spies The negotiations are predictable and a bit eerie, maybe because it is based on factual events which the maker in here, does not completely rely upon giving enough space for the drama to fit in. Bridge Of Spies is way too long for its material; especially the side characters that follows upto the event seems a bit redundant, and needs better editing. Spielberg does not let the movie slip away even for a frame; his execution is amazing in it and gives enough range for the actors to settle in on the screen. Tom Hanks has the job to glue all the sequences up for the audience to root for the character for he is the only common or familiar on screen and he stinks to its job very well with some good supporting cast like Mark Rylance. Bridge Of Spies comes off enthralling to the audience contrary to its genre; which I suppose shows the excellence of the director, for the writing seemed a bit loose on building up the characters for the audience to that level of drama as it was on paper.A hit from Spielberg I always find Spielberg a hit-and-miss director; for every winning thriller like MUNICH there's a piece of tat like INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL to come along and reduce the director's stature in my eyes. Thankfully, BRIDGE OF SPIES is one of his mature films, which translates into talkiness which is never boring thanks to a very strong script that recalls great Cold War thrillers like THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. Tom Hanks is once again a likeable, quick-thinking everyman who this time around is tasked with defending a Russian spy in the courts. I remember despising Mark Rylance's WOLF HALL when I attempted watching it, but Rylance is at the top of his game here and extremely likeable as the self-effacing spy. The film's true story origins means it has the ring of authenticity throughout and Spielberg admirably avoids sentimentality, instead presenting complex characters working their way through complicated situations. The end result is a film which delights from beginning to end.Really well made Cold War true story 'Bridge of Spies' is an espionage thriller at its finest. It's set in the late 50s &amp; early 60s and certainly looks the part - I always love seeing the old cars driving around New York, looking classy. Starts off like any classic spy film, but then Abel (Rylance) is caught. In comes Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer who is asked to defend Abel, so he can receive due legal practice. The first 45min or so is a good courtroom drama and moves along fast enough, with Hanks giving a few great speeches and making some solid points about what's right and what's best. The movie really captures well the Cold War tension in America and what families would've gone through. It helps that this is the best film Spielberg has made in a few years and the best film Hanks has been in for a while. Once the movie turns into political chess, with an exchange of Abel for Powers (Stowell) in Berlin, the stakes are raised and there's plenty of great subterfuge. Hanks basically owns the film, with everyone having some good moments (especially Rylance, with his "would it help?"s), but he really plays a great everyman who stands up to both Germany, Russia &amp; his own country (mostly portrayed by the CIA/Shepherd) for what is morally right and just, not just what is politically acceptable at the current time.Just Solid, Classic Spielberg One of the most prolific directors in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg, returns to the silver screen with his new period thriller "Bridge of Spies" starring two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks. It features competent and solid filmmaking from its director, writers, and crafts team however, the film doesn't quite ignite passion and excitement from its standard storytelling. What really manages to standout is the impeccable and sensational performance of Emmy Award nominee Mark Rylance, who steals and owns every scene he's present. The film tells the story of James Donovan (Hanks), an American lawyer that is recruited by the CIA during the Cold War to help rescue a pilot (Austin Stowell) detained in the Soviet Union. It all begins with the discovery of a probable spy on our own soil Rudolf Abel (Rylance), who tests Donovan's profession and safety net. Academy Award winner Steven Spielberg brings many of his signature techniques to the spy tale. Tugging at the emotional heartstrings is an Olympic event at this juncture in his career, although not exactly hitting the mark the way it was intended. He frames his scenes with the same familiar authority that we've grown to love about Spielberg, and it definitely exceeds some of his lesser works like "War Horse" and "The Terminal." What the film truly lacks is a daring approach to its source material. Unfamiliar with the story and real life individuals, Spielberg, and the writers, Joel &amp; Ethan Coen and Matt Charman, don't enter the grit and horror of two countries at a feud, literally on the brink of a real devastating war. Tom Hanks brings his natural charisma and wit that we've loved about him for decades. His James Donovan is caring, engaging, and reminiscent of Atticus Finch in "To Kill a Mockingbird." His devotion to his family and the human condition is truly admirable, all clear and on display thanks to Hanks. As Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance is just a joy to behold, filling in the gaps of the film's shortcomings with charm and seasoned acting ability. It's a brilliant turn by a brilliant actor. It's one of the year's best supporting turns and a contender for the Oscar statue. As James' wife Mary, Amy Ryan is relegated to just a few scenes but great nonetheless. Also brief are the works of Billy Magnussen and Alan Alda, who have good, solid one scenes to chew on. Technically the film does present qualms. Janusz Kaminski's camera work is distracting in parts, shining bright lights through windows, and keeping a one note camera style all throughout its 135 minute run time. Thomas Newman's score isn't put to its best use, as it swells in inopportune moments, even managing to overwhelm a key and fantastic scene by Rylance. Michael Kahn cuts the film to a bloated expansive run time but manages to keep you involved enough to make it through. The film really shines in its Production Design by Adam Stockhausen and its Costume work by Kasia Walicka-Maimone. "Bridge of Spies" may find lovers in mass audiences. What it does well is ignite a curiosity and power to look at the history of its subject. Spielberg succeeds at introducing the world to James Donovan and what else he contributed to society, along with the supporting players at hand. We do wish that a better, more dynamic treatment had hit the screens. From an awards standpoint, it's going to appeal to a great deal. Perhaps a second viewing will open up more possibilities.greatly condensed and more tightly intertwined Hanks gives a very satisfying, watchable and assured performance, with just the right amount of hokum, homely and wily in judiciously balanced proportions,Because this is Hanks we're dealing with, audiences know what to expect. it's terrific craftsmanship, pure storytelling gusto and that Midas- touch ability to find grounds for optimism everywhere, Steven Spielberg has dramatised a true-life cold war spy-swap drama, starring Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. Those brought up on John Le Carr√© might perhaps expect from this moral equivalence, shabby compromise and exhausted futility. But Spielberg, with his gift for uncynicism, uncovers decency and moral courage amidst all the Realpolitik. He works from an excellent screenplay by up-and-coming British dramatist Matt Charman, a script punched up in recognisable places by Joel and Ethan Coen.Great Performances and Good Drama Bridge of Spies (2015)  *** (out of 4) Attorney James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is given the thankless job of defending suspected Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Donovan accepts the job but soon finds himself defending his client a bit too good for some, which leads to him being the main negotiator between America and Russia when it comes time for a prisoner swap. Steven Spielberg's BRIDGE OF SPIES isn't one of the director's greatest works but it's certainly a very well-made film that manages to hold your attention throughout the rather long running time. I must admit that the trailer for the film really left me cold so I wasn't sure what to expect from the film but overall it's another good movie from the director, although the ending falls into that cringe-worthy, over-sentimental stuff that the director does quite often. With that said, there's no doubt that there's a highly good story being told here that grabs your attention and doesn't let it go. The screenplay by Joel &amp; Ethan Coen and Matt Charman does a very good job at capturing the spirit of the period and even if you're not familiar with the Cold War the film does a nice job at bringing you up to speed on the various fears. Spielberg perfectly handles the material and milks it for some nice drama as well as some political points that are certainly meant to be taken into consideration on some current issues. Hanks, as you'd expect, turns in an excellent performance and is certainly believable in the role of the attorney who finds his life spinning out of control from not only his wife but strangers who feels he is helping a spy. Hanks is such a calm grace that it really was entertaining just seeing him negotiate. Rylance also deserves a lot of credit for the way he played this character and I really loved the laid back approach to where the character never tips his cap in regards to what and who he really is. Technically speaking the film is quite good and of high standards. BRIDGE OF SPIES could have been a bit tougher on the political aspects but it's goal was to aim for the mainstream and in the end it's an entertaining film.Fascinating but a bit long One of the most interesting movies I have seen so far this year.  My only criticism was that it was just a tad too long and began to drag when Donovan was in Berlin trying to negotiate the prisoner exchange. It is definitely a movie for history buffs rather than people seeking a shoot 'em up, blow 'em up action movie. The characters of Abel and Donovan are both well developed. The historical settings are rich and enjoyable. People sensitive to Hollywood making fun of American culture may be upset by the portrayal of CIA operatives as descendants of the Keystone CopsThis is what real spies looks like This is one of only a few spy movies i happened to see in 2015. I have seen most of Steven Spielberg movies. Some of them i liked more than others. He created horror, adventure, mystery, fantasy, comedy genre movies. But his strongest movies are the ones about history. Bridge of spies is about a lawyer who gets in a dangerous politics game of spies between USA and USSR. I gotta say this movie is not adventure movie so if you are waiting for lots of action and shooting and running, forget it. But if you want to see a good realistic spy movie that shows what spies looks like in a real world this movie is a must. Again Tom Hanks performed perfectly. Directing, screenplay and cameraman job is done with highest standards. The only weak spot i would think of is it gets too sentimental at times. But who has seen Steven Spielberg movies, knows he does it a lot. I totally recommend this movie for history, real life events based movie lovers.Excellent espionage movie Against the backdrop of immensely popular TV Shows such as The Americans &amp; Deutschland 83, Bridge of Spies holds its own ground and showcases a masterpiece to the audience, thanks to the incredible duo - Steven Spielberg &amp; Tom Hanks. It seems they can do no wrong and this movie makes them one of the top collaborators in Hollywood.  As for the movie, its not especially intense as compared to other high octane spy thrillers, but shows a lighter and more delicate version of the cold war era politics, with focus on negotiation tactics employed by governments and their officials. Quick &amp; witty dialogues along with some great emotions displayed by the actors (Kudos to Mark Rylance) makes it one of the best movies to watch in 2015.Classic American Propaganda Beside the good acting of Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, there isn't many good things about this movie. Tom Hanks appears as a symbol of 'great' America, doing the right things one after another, even though the authorities are against it (like it is possible for him to act so independent) to symbolize how 'great' is the US. On the other hand Soviets are the evils as usual. Tortures against American soldier/spy, hostile military officers even against their own spy ( while American soldier does the exact opposite), scared children that got education at school about nuclear war (ironically with the footage of nuclear experiments that US did) and many other things that show how evil the Soviet was. But the American side had right causes to act unjust (not evil, just unjust) because they are patriots which is a good thing. To summarize, it is all about taking necessary dosage of American propaganda with some good acting.Liked this movie very much, except for one disturbing issue... I did not expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did, though as a child in the late 50's, the subject matter and terrifying school-based videos really struck a chord. The acting was also very good! I just have to note that I had a real problem with the comment wielded at Tom Hanks' character at the beginning of the movie by the CIA agent over a drink: "...don't go all Boy Scout on me..." No one would have said that in 1957 and there were a few other similar inconsistencies...annoying. This story is an important one to be told--the "cold war" was very real as children and downright frightening on a daily basis. It's important to get this message out to the younger audience.Great spy/legal/historical drama also good for families This is a great spy and legal drama on the exchange of spies during the cold war. I went to see it with the kids and they all liked it. The historical reconstruction (East Berlin in particular) is very realistic and the movie mixes very well "every day" life scenes with intense scenes. Tom Hanks played very well the unwilling soft spoken hero (Atticus Finch style). The stress that himself and his family had to bear is a tense part of the first half of the movie. The (almost) final scene when the family discovers his role in the exchange is a great masterpiece for me. Mark Rylance in the Soviet spy role is also a great supporting actor, so much like a stubborn, quiet grandfather working at the post office, and so much different from the "traditional Russian spy" (either half-naked lady or half-brained bully) to be entirely believable (and likable too). One of my kids knew the story from a spy history book and vouches for the accuracy of the details (minor issue is that the American spying plane pilot Powers seems a novice whilst he had several flights under his belly, but you can't have everything).Not much Interesting!!! Even though I am not American I found many interesting movies about history and biographical, but not this one. I went to this movie with great expectation of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks and the rating given for the movie, but the movie was below my expectation. I don't find ,much mystery,twist,thriller or interesting drama.  The movie was just going on towards successful deal. The opposite parties involved in the negotiation with Tom Hanks are approving for all his demands after every second attempt. All looks very less complicated negotiations.Over hyped may be because of entities shown in the film are big or because of I already read about the incident depicted in the movie. But still there are many movies you will tend to watch again and again even though you read the story and watched already, this one not up to that level. The role given for Tom Hanks is just a piece of cake for him. Movie may be interesting to the audience who obsessed with that true events. Not for me.. sorry!!'Bridge of Spies': A Cold Fight The montage of 'Bridge of Spies' is loaded with narratively significant match cuts. Those are reminiscent of the ironically great cut in 'Catch Me If You Can' where the shot of a girl saying "no, no ..." in surprise is harshly cut into "yes, yes ..." being yelled by the same girl while having intercourse consequently. It's useful to compare them with the pretentious, nonfunctional, so- called innovative jump cuts of Goddard's. Hitchcock once explained that cutting "should be called assembly. ¬Ö Montage means the assembly of pieces of film which, moved in rapid succession before the eye, create an idea." Spielberg surely have thoroughly comprehended the notion.  As far as I've noticed, each sequence is in a narratively significant dialogue with the ones surrounding it. Such dialogue is also aesthetical. For instance, there is a seemingly tranquil sequence, where Donovan is meeting the spy in confinement, preceded by an aggressively disruptive sequence - following the sentence being declared in the courtroom - and proceeding to a the scene where Donovan's house is being shot. This reminds me of the contrast characteristic of montage once explained by Hitchcock. The movie is also loaded with dark, fiendish ironies (again, reminiscent of 'Catch Me If You Can' to an extent) delicately embodied by Tom Hanks. The picture is full of good deeds, being done by the typecast Hanks, and some kind of patriotism which is so recurrent in Spielberg's works. Such extent of these characteristics are not appealing to me. Nonetheless, they've done their works so appropriately and elaborately that I can't help enjoying them! I get filled with the tremendous, yet not corny, melodramatic atmosphere the director builds up. One remarkable reason why it doesn't feel corny is that he demonstrates even the (so-to-say) villain in a perceptive manner. It is notable, as a recurrent element - and therefore a privilege from the auteurism point of view - that his typical protagonist is neither a hero nor a villain but he's somewhere in the middle. It should be also wisely noticed that such middle state is not caused by the character's (or indeed filmmakers') inability to possess a clear status but by his absolutely firm and self-assured status which isn't predominantly accepted. Take for instance Hanks's role as a purely professional lawyer in this movie, his role as an arguably hardboiled cop ‚Äì albeit not the protagonist - in 'Catch Me If You Can', Lincoln firmly believing in one simple principle in 'Lincoln' and Schindler as a mere industrialist in 'Schindler's List'. From a more detailed point of view, what matters to his protagonists is not the right or wrong but is (their) principles. For instance, Donovan, in this picture, believes in his job - and its principles - to such extent that even the Soviet spy, being defended by him, cautions "Jim ... you should be careful. Careful!"  Another privilege of Spielberg's over these contemporary, pretentious directors is his precise perception and elaborate fulfillment of complication and complexity. This picture, as an excellent example, features tens of instances of complication, in situations and interactions, which are likely to capture an audience's mind to such extent that it would reinforce the narrative and convey the suspense and thrill to the audience much more effectively. Such mature director is completely in contrast to the directors aforementioned. Take the highly cherished director, Nolan, for example. He's used to complicating his works so much that not only he, but perhaps anyone, can do. However, what he ‚Äì and that anyone naturally ‚Äì is unable to do is finishing up the narrative with any given degree of complication it's loaded with. He just abandons the narrative in a nondescript point.  There are two narratives constituting the story which, interestingly enough, while interacting with each other, gradually build up the political condition of the day too. It just caught my undivided attention how a cold fight, magnificently representing the Cold War, was demonstrated throughout the last sequences of the film ‚Äì not to mention it's there throughout the movie with varying degrees. Throughout those final sequences, Donovan is involved in an outrageous fight where everyone is fully attempting to prove their power. It is literally a cold fight. It employs no muscle but is absolutely detrimental and nerve-wrecking.  The Cold War, naturally, had a cold side to it, signifying you couldn't know what's to come for sure. However, it was extraordinarily hot. Living in the day, while bombarded by propagandas suggesting a horrible war could begin at any time, one would be overwhelmed, distressed and, in all, superfluously confident. Such state of tremendously firm presumptions regarding war, enemy and stuff like that is fabulously suggested by the blinding lights throughout the movie. In most cases, light is dreadfully dark in this movie, making it arguably a groundbreaking neo-noir. Such lighting suggests the sense of assurance in the confinement and incarceration scenes too; this time implying Donovan and the spy being assured of their professional principles, which is what's common between them, as the glamorous gleam in their background is. His employment of technology, unlike most of Hollywood directors' exploitation of technology, actively induces my analytic enjoyment. Finally, the amphiboly in the title of the picture caught my eyes. Bridge has two meanings here. Its second meaning, medium/facilitator, is Donovan himself who, at the peak of the movie, ends up at a bridge (the first meaning) bridging the spies. And you see a final touch in the end of the sequence where everyone leaves the situation rapidly and all the lights are turned off but Donovan stays. And ultimately, the aerial long shot ‚Äì featuring only Donovan and the bridge ‚Äì implies the amphiboly in the title, 'Bridge of Spies'.  So far as I've watched Spielberg's works, along with 'Catch Me If You Can', this one of his have best appealed to me. PS. Spielberg-Hanks, undoubtedly, is one the functionally greatest duo in filmmaking.Spielberg shows us a simpler, humaner side of the Cold-War era I should start by saying that this movie really moved me - in a way that I truly didn't expect it to. As the end credits rolled I found myself in soft tears, something I almost never do.  Maybe it's the setting, I was expecting a spy movie packed with intense dialogue or maybe even chases here and there... I was so wrong and for the better of it. Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor and he plays the role of a simple lawyer being dragged into an unfamiliar situation with a huge amount of confidence and bravery. He fights for what he believes is right and plays both sides ( the Germans and the Russians) perfectly. I love his line in the end "It doesn't matter what people think, you know what you did." Make no mistake, this is a human drama with all the best elements of a spy story. The acting by both Hanks and Rylance is great, Mr. Mark is a pleasure to watch and I don't think that anyone could have played the role of the soviet spy better than he did. There is something in his eyes and the way he talks, it just pins you down and you just have to focus on him. Of course, the camera work in the movie is excellent and it really puts you right inside the action - especially in the second part of the movie.Engaging, Entertaining and very Hollywood A well acted movie with catchy dialog. Too often though, it sounds like punch lines being delivered. "I'm not afraid to die....Then the punchline...but it wouldn't be my first choice." Unfortunately it was meant to please not give the story any depth. At the end of the film you know nothing about, nor care about, the characters other than what was minimally needed to move the story. Just for the record, all the women are minor characters. You really don't have an idea about the relationship between the Tom Hanks character and his wife. Refreshingly, there no guns, girls or chase scenes and yet the movie is engaging. Tom Hanks is the anti James Bond.As Gripping and Smart as Any Spy Thriller Made Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.8/5 stars With "Bridge of Spies", Steven Spielberg infuses new life in Hollywood's all-but-forgotten Cold War espionage thrillers from the 70s and 80s. He goes about creating an arresting, sometimes haunting milieu in the midst of a mission of wits and high-intensity at the height of the Cold War, where American attorney James B. Donovan is recruited by the CIA to negotiate the release of a US spy-plane pilot - shot down and captured in Soviet territory - in exchange of a KGB spy, Rudolf Abel, who was arrested for espionage in the US. Spielberg enters full-blown Stanley Kramer mode, and triumphantly delivers (like he has on numerous times in his distinguished career) a socially conscious tale of back-and-forth diplomacy and behind- closed-doors politics at home, at the office, and on the global stage. At the same time, he doesn't let up the tension for a moment in this richly-detailed narrative where the interactions between smart and unpredictable characters is the main focus of the Director and his writers (the maverick Coen Brothers; avant-garde filmmakers in their own right). And, eventually, it's these interactions that are the core foundation of "Bridge of Spies", with its real strength lying in the bond developed between its two main characters - unwitting negotiator Donovan (Tom Hanks in fine form) and incarcerated Soviet spy Abel (Mark Rylance deservedly an Oscar nominee). The warm portrait of a highly unlikely friendship is perhaps the movie's greatest achievement, even more than its sublime Direction, crisp writing, lasting cinematography, and exemplary performances. Steven Spielberg and the Coen Brothers take on the Cold War and spy world with a visually stunning, tension-filled, and surprisingly feel-good thriller that slithers along with gripping intensity and tantalizing uncertainty.History written with excellence History comes alive with Bridge of Spies. Mark Rylance is excellently cast as Rudolph Able, by all appearances, a kindly man who just wishes to be alone with his paint set. Appearances are deceiving, as we learn he is actually a Russian spy. Playing out as a secondary story, we watch as Francis Gary Powers is selected to fly a US plane in order to gather intelligence on Russia. Given a poison to take should he be captured, Powers realizes how dangerous a mission he was about to undertake. James Donovan is charged with the task of providing Able a suitable defense, not unlike John Adams had been called to do nearly two hundred years before with the Red Coats who fired into the crowd at Boston. Donovan loses in court, but is able to spare Able's life, citing that killing him would only incite hostilities against the US by Russia. Powers' mission is a failure as he is shot down, and tortured by the Russians. To add to the events, the Berlin Wall is going up in Germany, causing strife in that country as well. Fredric Pryor, an American college student studying abroad, is taken prisoner. Sent under orders to do an even change, Able for Powers, Donovan doesn't like the idea of leaving an American behind. To the dismay of the US Government, Donovan begins to set negations to get both Pryor and Powers, telling the Russians that they won't get Able if the US doesn't get both of their citizens back. The drama intensifies as it appears Germany may balk at the suggestion of giving up Pryor. The events come to ahead on a snowy bridge, as Able and Powers stand on opposite sides of the bridge, not knowing if they would step foot on the homeland again. At the last second, the Germans show up at Checkpoint Charlie with Pryor, and the exchange is made, and Donovan is happy with his success, yet worried about Able's fate, as the two have become friends amongst the madness of world politics. The brisk pace of the movie, as well as the engaging characters make this a must see movie. Alan Alda proves he still has it, even though he appears briefly in the film. Both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance both forth such amazing performances, that both should be considered Oscar worthy. It's next to impossible to make a suspenseful film about a historical event of which you already know the outcome. Yet Spielberg is able to do just that. This is a true must see film! 10 out of 10.Another masterpiece from the grand master. Well What can i say? Spielberg did it again! This is a film that has that instant feeling you just love it and you're watching something truly special. And its a true story, and i'm a sucker for true stories. The story its another great lesson to be learned by humanity, and the screenplay does an outstanding job telling it. It has all the ingredients Spielberg is known for, the hope in humanity, the believe in the mans power to change the course of history for the good, the true selfless, and so on.  The cast is beyond perfect, and everyone gives amazing performances, but of course Tom Hanks steals the show, he gives one of his most likable performances, in the end the character helps a lot. Its just a bigger than life character which fits like a glove in Tom Hanks. The other characters are also amazing, but the one that stands the most to me, even if hes not the one to appear the most, is the Russian spy (Mark Rylance) hes just one of those characters that his so unique and likable that is amazing. The production values are just top notch as one would expect from a Spielberg film. The visuals are hauntingly beautiful and perfectly illustrate the feel of the cold war. The film is amazingly shot, there's a scene with an aircraft that is breathtaking. The special effects are perfect. The production design is bound to be nominated for an Oscar, special attention to the Berlin settings. The score is another hit for Thomas Newman, though the film has this amazing atmosphere were there's very little score and the one there is is mainly in the final minutes. This gives a very authentic and realistic feeling to the film, its like you are really rgere. Thats why i was surprised that the length of the score is almost 50 minutes!  Overall the film has a lot in common with Lincoln, its really the perfect follower to that amazing picture. This is one of those films where you just get lost in the story, it's a very immersive film, a true masterpiece thats bound to get a ton of nominations from the academy.Slow as death - felt like a MOW/Docudrama. Little substance and Boring! I am a big fan of Spielberg and really had high expectations for this film. However, it was so slow moving that if it was not for the director name and Tom Hanks I would have walked out of it. Yes, you read that correctly. There was really nothing moving about the movie and the over saturated directing made it even worse. The main few events were played over and over so much that the end of the story felt blaise. Great material and wonderful that it is a true story but it was the most shallow slow moving boring docudrama and I love history but I would not recommend or waste any money on this movie. I give it a 1 star and the worst movie Spielberg has made.
Imagine yourself as a 5 year old child discovering for the first time a brand new world exists outside of your room At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival the film "ROOM" won the People's Choice Award today. It tells a story of a young woman and her five year old son who have been held in captivity in a confined and windowless living space for six years. Brie Larson stars as Ma and her son named Jack is played by Jacob Tremblay who is so believable that you will feel empathetic towards their captivity but relief as to how Ma convinces Jack that their little world is real and is wonderful.  As Jack grows he starts to ask questions about their isolated lifestyle and we the audience anticipate that Ma must try and escape with young Jack but how? The story draws similarities to the actual events that were Jaycee Lee Dugard's true life story which occurred on June 10, 1991, in South Lake Tahoe, California. Dugard was 11 years old at the time she was abducted from a street while she was walking from home to a school bus stop and she was held captive for the next 18 years in a concealed back yard in a make shift shed. There is also some resemblance to the kidnapping of Amanda Berry who had a child fathered by her kidnapper Ariel Castro. This film was titled Cleveland Abduction and it was released in 2015. It tells the true story of three girls who were held captive for over 10 years by Ariel Castro in his home with no one aware how close the girls were to their own homes and families. The film Room focuses more on Jack and Ma's awkward adjustment to life outside of their room which was their entire world for the past six years. There is a strong supporting cast including performances such as Joan Allen's role as Jack's loving Grandma and the ever convincing all-star William H Macy as a resistant Grandpa who is having difficulty accepting that his daughter is raising her rapist's son.  There are some scenes that are so heartwarming that it will be difficult not to find yourself becoming emotionally involved. In one particular very touching and loving scene, Jack asks his Grandma to cut his long hair so that the strength that he thinks that his shoulder length hair possesses can be transferred over to his sick Ma so she can return home from the hospital. Jack who understandably is initially withdrawn from anyone other than his Ma simply tells his Grandma after she washes and cuts his hair that he loves her. This loving scene between Jack and his Grandma will stay with me forever.  Jack and Ma's is a story of isolation, fear, hopelessness versus hope and most importantly a film about redemption and the family bond. Room is deserving of an Oscar nomination for best picture and nominations in a few other categories as well such as best actress, best actor and best director. I give the film a 9.5 out of 10 rating. This film is terrific!!This one is gonna stick with me "Room" is an adaption of an internationally best-seller novel written by Irish playwright and novelist, Emma Donoghue. This is her first book to be adapted into a major motion picture and I have to say that it is a rather impressive one. I have not read Emma's novel yet, but I can only guess that this movie sticks to the novel's roots, considering that Emma decided to write the screenplay herself. Room is a story about a women who was kidnapped during her high school years and locked in a shed for 7 years. She was impregnated by her kidnapper in this room and was locked inside with the child. The child grows up and around the age of five is when the movie picks up. Throughout this entire movie we are taken through this story strictly from the Jack's (the child) point of view. Even though this story is experienced through the lens of this child, the story is in no way filtered or gussied up. It is this intimate and raw story about a child and his mother spending a hugely relevant portion of their existence stuck in this dull, dirty and claustrophobia-inducing shed. This shed contained one small window that emits a tiny portion of daylight into the room. To me, this represented a light at the end of the tunnel. Sort of like a tiny glimmer of hope in a deep and dark abyss. Throughout this entire movie, Jack narrates his experiences as he embarks upon the world. Jacob Trembley portrays this character with such a sense of wonder and innocence that every single narration that I hear from this boy is just heartbreaking. Every time Jack takes away something from the world, he takes it in as something new and exciting even if it is scary. They are things that everyone takes for granted everyday: trees, dogs, the sky, etc. You would think that the dramatic climax would be at the beginning when Jack gets out of the tiny room he has been locked in his entire life, but after-wards, this film just drags in one dramatic scene after another in a way that turns this film into one big heartache an experience. I do have say that Jacob Trembley and Allison Brie's performances carry a lot of the weight of this film. Allison gives a very natural and organic performance. You never catch her overacting or being too stiff during any scene in this movie. Jack Trembley gave one of the most, if not the most, impressive performances of the year. Not just because of his age, but because of how well of a dramatic performance that he gives without over or underacting in any of his scenes. He seemed to take his role with a very adult-like seriousness that translated into a lot of the movie's themes of innocence that are chased by the persistent and harsh reality that Jack and his mother are facing. The directing and cinematography in this film are beautiful. The film's intense theme is complimented with a variety of out-of- focus and close up shots that highlight the child's immediate consciousness as he takes the outside world with fresh- eyes. Many of the scenes are also complimented by a beautiful and breathtaking film score composed by the award-winning Stephen Rennicks who has been crafting soundtracks in the indie film world since 1997. Overall, this is a film that I won't be forgetting for the rest of my life. Mainly because it is a film about escaping outside of the room that you have been stuck in your whole life and discovering a world that has been hidden from you. I know that sounds kind of cheesy but this film does it in the most grounded and intense way possible. Not to mention that it is dosed with themes of abandonment, human-kindness, and media exploitation. I don't usually give films a 10/10. As a matter of fact, I could probably count the films this year that I do consider 10s on one hand. The films I consider perfect are life changing in some way or benchmarks in cinematic history. While this film will probably be washed away by the ever expanding ocean that is cinema, it is not a movie that I will be personally ever forgetting. I can't remember watching a film that made me feel so grateful for just being alive.A brilliant movie, but painful to watch Room (2015/I) was directed by Lenny Abrahamson. It stars Jacob Tremblay as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother ("Ma") The situation becomes very clear early in the film. Jack and his mother are held captive by a man who has kidnapped her, raped her, impregnated her, and uses her as his sexual slave. Jack and his mother have lived in a small, locked shed, which they call "Room." Jack's mother has lived in "Room" since she was abducted seven years earlier. Jack has lived there for all of his life--five years. By incredible ingenuity, motivated by love, Ma has kept Jack from realizing the horrors of their situation. It's hard to believe that anyone could be so motivated and capable, allowing the boy to believe that his situation is normal, but it works in the film and you accept it. What happens next is pretty well known, but I won't go into it because it might decrease your enjoyment of the movie. It's dramatic, frightening, and, heart-wrenching, all at the same time. Brie Larson does a wonderful job as the mother, and Jacob Tremblay has to be the best child actor we have. He is absolutely brilliant. Director Abrahamson must be an extremely talented man to draw two such great performances from his actors. This is a must-see film, but it's not easy to watch. Even though Room wasn't based on any specific incident, we all know of cases of warped men who have kidnapped and enslaved women. It's hard to think about the lives of those women without becoming depressed.  We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. Given the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie, it will work on the small screen as well. Seek it out and watch, but prepare yourself mentally before you begin.Infinitely deep, an experience I will not forget. *Insert all 9 &amp; 10 reviews here* I was in awe during the entire film. Lenny Abrahamson &amp; the writing team made sure there was not one dull moment. The addition of "insignificant" characters and plot twists are later realized to be so significant and influential in keeping the film alive throughout its duration. It was the little things that made this story one of the best I've seen in a long time. I experienced an entire palette of emotions all at once and was left in a deep level of curiosity and reflection. Very few films have the power to continue to influence its audience after the credits. Room is endless in the most beautiful way.A non-traditional thriller with another brilliant turn from Brie Larson but an even better one from Jacob Tremblay. Room is a harrowing thriller, but not in the traditional sense of the word. It deals with a dark subject matter and the first half of the film can be quite disturbing. Yet director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) has adapted the best-selling novel with grace and grandeur. Here is a film so artistically unique and deviant, chock full of genuine emotion thanks to two outstanding performances, that isn't afraid to take risks and surprise at every turn. Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue, Room introduces us to Ma and Jack, a mother and son held captive in a garden shed. As we learn more about their captivity, their world becomes clearer and clearer to us. They live by a routine, have names for every object in room, and Ma must be careful as her son grows older and more curious. The film is structured into two halves, and by now it's no spoiler that the second half deals with their readjustment into the outside world, and Jack's first time outside of room. The film is thematically complex, yet never overwhelming. At its core it's about motherhood, but Jack's unique upbringing complicates things. Director Lenny Abrahamson is no stranger to the strange, and with Room he's made a masterpiece of filmmaking. The entire idea of 'room,' the abstract concept of space, is ever-present in the production. In their bubble of room, Ma and Jack are restricted, as evident by Abrahamson's close angles and tight shots. The small space allows for high concept filmmaking, and when they get out of room, it only gets better, with a new color palette and experimental camera angles through Jack's eyes. The entire film is seen through the eyes of this child, and it's genius. What I loved about the book was its focus on Jack and how he adjusts to seeing this new world for the first time, and the movie never loses sight of that. I wrote about the pressure placed on child actors in my review for the incredible Beasts of No Nation, and Jacob Tremblay fits like a glove. Like Abraham Attah, he isn't a child actor, but an actor who just happens to be of a younger age. His wide eyes and expressive thoughts are very believable, and when he sees the outside world for the first time, it's a thing of beauty. Tremblay has brilliant chemistry with Brie Larson, and for one second I never doubted her devotion to him. As Ma faces frustrating upon leaving room, from her parents, doctors, and the media, she never forgets her son Jack, and always puts his wellbeing first. Larson taps into this character, one that undergoes a stunning transformation as she basically lost seven years of her life being locked up. Her performance will blow you away. The best actors are the ones able to transport you into their characters' own universes, no matter how isolated from society they happen to be. Larson, Tremblay, and Joan Allen all have a tremendous range of emotional ability and are able to sell you on their story not just for two hours, but for an entire lifetime. With Room, Abrahamson goes the extra mile with his direction, and director of photography Danny Cohen keeps all eyes on Jack. The film asks us to examine how we view the world and how this viewpoint is shaped by our nurtured upbringing. The result is a breathtaking experience brought to life, one you won't soon forget.A tense and compelling film Lenny Abrahamson's Room opens in a 10 x 10 room that has no windows, a locked door, and no light other than that provided by an overhead skylight. Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a slight five-year old boy with hair down to his shoulders wakes up each morning as he has all his life, saying hello to his world. He says hello, not to the sun or the grass outside his front door where he can run and laugh and play but only to the objects which is all his world consists of: the lamp, the sink, the plant, the refrigerator. His only friend is a mouse that he feeds with some pleasure. Not that he lacks for companionship. Ma (Brie Larson) is with him and their endless days consist of cooking, reading, and watching TV where Jack is told that what he sees on the screen is not real, only pretend. All he knows of the world is what he sees in front of his eyes. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) brings food and other household items but when he comes, Jack has to hide in his wardrobe, out of sight. Ma, we find out, has been kept prisoner and used for sex by the hulking man who comes every night and we know that Jack is a result of his mother's rape. Jack is the focus of the film and we see everything from his point of view, with the help of his sometime narration but we can also get into his mother's mind and feel her pain and live her dreams. There is never any doubt of his mother's love though the obvious strain of keeping herself from crying out every minute is painfully obvious. To Jack, she is the center of his world and his reason for being. When the second half of the film takes a surprising turn and shifts 180 degrees, Jack and Ma are not prepared for what awaits them. Even when an alternative is suggested as possible, he doesn't want to hear anything about a different world with blue sky and rivers and trees. Room is a tense and compelling film in which Brie Larson more than fulfills the brilliance that she showed in Short Term 12 and should make her an Oscar contender. Tremblay is also superb. He lives his character and makes him come alive, even though he is only nine years old. Supporting roles by Joan Allen and William H. Macy also contribute to the film's second half but it is always Larson and Tremblay that carry the day. The film is not mawkish or sentimental even though the soaring score by Stephen Rennicks comes close. While there are has some plot implausibilities, the film is a tribute to the resiliency and the dedicated love of a parent for their child. It is also a teaching experience. Like many who are walled off from each other and think the box they are in is all there is, the film can give us the combination to open the locked door, if we take the risk to turn the key.The best film I've seen in years: indescribable! I know one thing, I will never, ever forget this heartrending, unbelievably-acted 'movie' for the rest of my days. I'm just at a loss for words and struggling to describe how truly powerful and heart-grabbing this story was. I'll go so far as to say that if you don't cry, shed a tear, or feel the urge to weep profusely after (or while) watching Room, you don't have a heart. The mother (Brie Larson) and her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. The beauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universally relatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep, deep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears; sometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. It made me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always had my eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I was witnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told and one of the best uses of cinema I've ever seen. ...Try not to read much/anything about it before going in to see it (and yes, definitely catch it in a theater near you ASAP). Go in and be engrossed and moved (in ways I can't describe) by this experience. 10/10 *Hands down* the best film of 2015, and the single best thing I've seen in years. :')A Harrowing Film with Incredible Performances! Based on the novel of the same name by Emma Donoghue, 'Room' is a challenging, unsettling, harrowing film, that leaves you disturbed. But that is its sheer power. The Incredible Performances only add to the film's hefty nature. 'Room' Synopsis: After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a thrilling discovery: the outside world. 'Room' is a disturbing story about bad things that happen to good people. But its also about hope &amp; fighting back. Its shocking to see the protagonist, a child, discover the world along-with his brave mother, who survived a harrowing experience. I was engrossed &amp; often disturbed by the narrative, especially after the son &amp; mother escape. The series of events that follow are so gut-wrenching, I almost broke down. 'Room' is masterfully penned by Emma Donoghue herself. The Writing is consistently powerful &amp; the dialogue are realistic to the core. Lenny Abrahamson's Direction is first-class. He has handled this dramatic, unsettling tale with complete flourish. Cinematography is perfectly claustrophobic. Editing is razor-crisp. Art Design is skilfully done. Performance-Wise: Brie Larson &amp; Jacob Tremblay deliver incredible performances. Brie is astounding as the tormented, yet brave protagonist, while Jacob steals the show with a flawless performance. The child does wonders &amp; makes 'Room' unforgettable. Of the supporting cast, Joan Allen &amp; The Always Solid William H. Macy leave a solid mark. On the whole, 'Room' is a must watch! Its certainly unsettling, but its power is undeniable.Beautiful, moving, intense I haven't seen a genuinely emotional, smart, non-manipulative, heart- felt drama in a loooong time. Brie Larson deservedly won an Oscar for her performance in this, but Room should've swept the board in every category. The film centres on a Mother and her five year old son, living inside just four walls, and it slowly transpires that she has been held captive for seven years, and had a child by her kidnapper. She creates a world for her son within their confines, not telling him the truth about their situation and what's outside until he's old enough to understand. After failed escape attempts in the past, but now with the help of her son, she gives freedom another try. There were moments in Room that were so intense that I barely breathed. It never feels inauthentic, and thanks to incredible acting, it's always believable. If you want a straight-up thriller of 'bad guy commits crime, bad guy gets comeuppance', you'll be disappointed. This is about human resilience, the bond between Mother and child, selflessness, and finding your place in the world after having your understanding of it flipped upside down.Awesome film - shame about the trailer Room, based on the book by Emma Donoghue, starts on young Jack's 5th birthday. He gets a birthday cake from his mother (but no candles); a visit from his father; and a gift, albeit belatedly. This would all be perfectly normal except that all of this takes place within 'Room' - a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight and no means of escape. For the mother, Joy, was abducted as a teen and locked away for sex in the style of the dreadful real-life examples such as that perpetrated by Josef Fritzl in Austria. Jack is the (presumably) unintended result: a boy with no perception of the real world beyond his four single-sided walls and with the staunchly-held view that the things he sees on a flickering TV screen are in 'TV land' and unreal. Will Jack and Joy survive and ever see freedom again?  And that's where I'll leave this synopsis, since (if you've been lucky enough to avoid the trailer) there is a tense cat-and-mouse story to unfurl here. This is an absorbing, although slow-moving, film that builds to some truly nail-biting moments. The screenwriter (also Donoghue) and director (Irishman Lenny "Frank" Abrahamson) are to be commended in keeping the story and drama really well-grounded and un-saccharined. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), the 'evil kidnapper', is not painted as some predictable monster: he is even portrayed to be kind and caring at some warped level. And there is no gratuitous sex: we are in effect seven years into the story and the abnormal is now completely normalised. The film is told primarily from the viewpoint of Jack (Jacob Tremblay) but we also get under the skin of Joy (Brie Larson) and her emotions in trying to mentally deal with her ordeal. Looking at a picture of her with her school friends she bitterly comments that "Nothing happened to them - - they just got on with their lives". The acting is superb. I made the mistake of voting for John Boyega for the BAFTA Rising Star award before seeing this film (you can cast your vote here http://www.bafta.org/film/awards/ee-rising-star-award-in-2016). Not that Boyega isn't great, but Brie Larson really REALLY delivers here. She obviously won't give a hoot if she wins the Best Actress Oscar! And for me, for this award, she shines out in what I would perhaps see as one of this year's weaker Oscar categories. Jacob Tremblay is also exceptional as Jack - and it would be nice (rather than try to compare young performances with adult ones, as per Anna Paquin) if there was a special awards category for actors and actresses under 10. If there was, then Tremblay would storm it! You seriously forget that this is a child acting a part. He is totally connected to the role and these two core performances lock in your belief in the story. Supporting the cast are the ever reliable William H Macy as Joy's mentally tortured father, Joan Allen (Pamela Landy from the "Bourne" films) as her equally distraught mother and Sean Bridgers as the kidnapper. At 2 hours long some of the scenes in the middle of the film made my attention waver a little. But my main criticism is in the trailer and marketing of the film. If ever there was a need for a true 'teaser trailer' this is it. I never know who is responsible for putting trailers together - whether the director has the final say or whether its some nameless marketing bods in the distribution company, but whoever it is they should be taken out and 'given a good talking to' for this travesty. It's like putting all of the twists in films like "The Crying Game", "The Sixth Sense" and "Gone Girl" in their respective trailers. I've gone so far as to create my own One Mann's Movies cut of the trailer, just for you good people, which I have included with my bob-the-movie-man.com version of this review. A leisurely, nuanced and effecting drama, this is not for fans of "Die Hard" or "Fast and Furious" fans. But for everyone else, this should be a must see. Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks.(Insert Expletive Here).... Perfect!!!!! Don't listen to the haters or those that want to chip away at the overall brilliance of 'Room'. What film doesn't have small flaws, they pale into insignificance during the 2 hours of continuous emotional maelstrom that follows. This film wrings every last drop of emotion and drama out of the allotted playtime. Make no mistake, despite short bursts of touching serenity, this films starts up full throttle and doesn't let-up. I can only assume reviewers here scoring this film 8 or less must be Vulcan by birth, or just terminally insensitive. This is a first rate drama with stand out performances all round. Especially from the child protagonist.  **Warning** If you have trouble viewing emotionally charged material of a sensitive nature about abuse. You would be well advised not to view this film.room is perfect Too many tears, too much sadness. Story of a teenager Ma kidnapped, raped and made a mom. And mom and son Jack locked in a room away from the world. Really sad when Jack said I don't want to be 5 I want to be 4. Even a 5 year old wants continued happiness in simplicity and in the arms of his only friend his own mother. He wants to be breast fed , he wants to shower with his Ma. He enjoys the only place he knows for his first 5 yrs of his life. There is no chaos from the real person he knows. Ma wants Jack to rescue them from the room. Life outside the room has its' own problems of tears, cries, fights. Excellent writing by Emma Donoghue who wrote the novel and the screenplay. Jacob Tremblay as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother Ma are terrific. Every scene, every dialogue has sincerity. Oscar worthy screenplay. Oscar worthy acting . Joan Allen as Ma's mom and Jack's grandma is perfect grandma, loving, caring, sensitive and excellent. Definite Oscar nominees. Jacob Tremblay , so young and so perfect in every scene.One of those small movies that deserve much more than what will ever be given This is a movie I saw because it was nominated for the Oscars. I had to see the one to make the bet. Thank God I make the bet, I have come to see this great movie. Although I think that it has several shortcomings of script, that will explain in zone spoiler, still I think that it knows them to surpass more and goes ahead. Also hooks and you want to continue watching. The actors are great. If I'm not mistaken they are all unknown but that does not stop them from being great. Even the child and it is not easy to do. The picture is not very good outdoors, but to make a credible film is enough. Even if you do not have nice blueprints or composites. The director, if he knows how to take the film forward. When the thread is finished, it knows how to change and move on and that is very difficult. Spoiler: For me the problem with the script is that I think that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room ends quickly and then it has to continue somewhere. You are watching it and you do not know what happens until you discover it, but when you discover it, you do not know where it is going to go, but it is still on one side and still very well. At the second turning point, the same thing happens exactly as well. Another great thing about the movie, which plays the script is that of acceptance. Will the grandparents accept their grandchild born of rape? It is a pleasure to meet these jewels that the world of cinema offers us.This movie transformed my life, but not for the reasons people might think I usually trust RottenTomatoes and IMDb ratings, and while I might watch something that gets a 60% rating or above if the subject interests me, I will usually fall in line with the critics and reviewers on any movie that gets a 97% on RT or such high scores on IMDb. Well, this movie completely shattered my entire belief system, to the point where I find myself without a guiding light for the future. Many better worded reviews on this site have already captured the grievances that I had with this film, but I must write mine out so that I can feel better and move on with my life... It felt like it was 3 hours long. In an unbelievable feat of cinematography, they managed to stretch time so that a 2 hour movie felt like 3. The could have condensed the film into an hour and 20 minutes and I would felt less cheated. Outside of a short plot line, *nothing* happened. And every single thread that could have been interesting to develop was cut short leaving us unsatisfied and wondering.  It's a movie about nothing. There was no great insight into the human cause or suffering, no great insight into the psyche of the captor, no details on the parental breakup, no real role given to the very interesting characters of the girl's real father or her mom's new husband. The girl was a b*tch (I mean, that's forgivable given the circumstances), but outside of sympathy for her, it was not entertaining to connect with her on any level. And every single time anything got interesting in the movie the scene ended. The real life is a lot scarier and way more touching than this movie, and unless one lives in a room, turning on the news every day brings a lot more real emotion and watching a poorly constructed movie with a very minimal depth is not that touching. What can we learn from a 5 year old and his view on the world? That could be interesting to see, sure, but even here, the monologues were short and infantile (because what would you expect from a 5 year old?) Jack was no great thinker at a young age. Yes, the world is full of wonder on the outside, whether you're 5 or 85. Perhaps it was a movie for those whose view on life has gotten so complacent that they lost any sense of that wonderment and listening to an annoying 5 year old describe his first experiences in the real world outside of his room brought them to tears because of nostalgia or remembering their own childhood innocence. Clearly, I am one of the few against the world who Loved this movie, so I'll be the first to admit defeat. Now, however, I'm left to scratch my head and re-evaluate my relationship with movie reviews.Sensitive and Delicate Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live in a small room in a shed without windows and with only a skylight on the roof. When Joy has encounters with a man, Jack locks himself in a closet. When Jack is five years old, Joy tells him that she lived with her parents in a comfortable house and a man called Old Nick lured and kidnapped her seven years ago. Joy plots a scheme to let Jack flee from the room and call the police. When they are rescued, they move to the house of Joy's mother and they have to begin the adaptation to the routine of a normal life. But is it not easy. "Room" is a sensitive and delicate film with a dramatic and realistic story of woman and child abuse and the effects in the aftermath. The screenplay is very well written increasing tension without the use of cheap means such as graphic violence, sex and gore but only subtle dialogues. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay have awesome performances, showing also fantastic chemistry, and with magnificent supporting cast including names such as Joan Allen and William H. Macy. In the end, "Room" is an unforgettable and unique film that touches the viewer's heart. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Quarto de Jack" ("The Room of Jack")Fails To Plumb The Subject's Depth A poor kissing cousin to "Stockholm, Pennsylvania," "Room" is a backyard shed creating the world's limits to a kidnapped young woman and her by-the-adbductor son. Snatched at seventeen, Joy (Brie Larson) is imprisoned for seven years by a standard, un-dimensional psycho holding the power of life and death over her. (Cross him in the least and there's no electricity or heat.) At the start, Joy's son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), is angry and semi-feral yet quite content following silly rules in the only world he knows. Their pointless days come to an end when Joy contrives Jack's death forcing the psycho to bury the allegedly dead child. Well-rehearsed, Jack escapes and the dominoes fall leading to their escape to a world that has passed by Joy and one in which Jack has zero knowledge (a first encounter with steps mystifies him). Yellow ribbons and celebrations follow. With opposite effect. Joy's parents have divorced, high school chums have moved on. A formative slice of high school track star Joy's life is missing. Joy's biological dad harshly judges her; mom and daughter fight at the same level of a rebellious teen railing against parental control. Due to his age, Jack is 'plastic', his societal integration much easier. Soon he's knocking around a ball with neighbor kid. But, a reporter's insensitive question causes Joy to break down which leads to a brief institutionalization. And she's released all better. However, the treatment of an inherently dramatic subject matter of abduction and reintegration here falls short. The sunshine and rainbows, feel good ending, while moving, is mawkish. Everyone is healed and the horror of what was lived through for nearly a decade is forgotten. It is also a cheap device when children are wiser than adults. All these problems of the script. The balance of the failure of this film rests squarely on Brie Larson's shoulders. Her portrayal, as others, is at arms length with the character and hit a wall keeping her from connecting with feelings. Many crow her portrayal is spectacular. For her it is. In the annals of effective acting it is middling. Therefore, this is her tour de force - by default. "Stockholm, Pennsylvania" took the protagonist's story to a far more logical, satisfying and shocking conclusion. On the base, sensational end of the spectrum, TV's "Cleveland Abduction." Find "Room" between the two. Either a good movie-of-the-week or poor indie sidestepping, and in some ways trivializing, a horrific subject. Watch "Stockholm, Pennsylvania" instead.Totally avoidable This is one of those movies that the IMDb rating tricks you into believing is better than it actually is. The IMDb synopsis also makes you believe that you are being taken on a journey - of the struggles of being held captive, into the psyche of the captor, of the innocence of childhood, of motherly love that triumphs. You probably imagine some sort of "Life is Beautiful" unfolding in a room. But NO! Be warned. This movie is about an annoying kid and his annoyed mom stuck in a room. They both manage to escape the room and guess what? They continue to be annoying and annoyed. The characters are so completely one dimensional, the movie fails to both entertain or be insightful. You end up feeling stuck with the characters in this 2 hour long ordeal. Like someone dragging a fingernail on a chalkboard. The quickly made TV documentaries after kidnapped victims are rescued (as in the case of Elizabeth Smart or Amanda Berry) look like Oscar winning stories in contrast and are actually watchable. This movie is plain painful to watch.Disturbing abduction plot and subsequent redemption tale doesn't rise above the level of an average Lifetime Movie Room is based on the 2010 novel of the same name by the Irish turned Canadian novelist/playwright Emma Donoghue. The film has already garnered accolades from almost all critical quarters with heaps of approbation for its lead actress, Brie Larson. It's a rather uncomplicated story with a plot that is broken up into two distinct parts. For the first 45 minutes or so, a young mother, Joy, and five year old son, Jack, appear trapped in a small room where they've been residing for quite a long time. Eventually it's revealed we're watching a horror story: seven years earlier, when Joy was 17 years old, she was kidnapped by a neighborhood pervert, Old Nick, who has kept her prisoner in a shed next to his house. Old Nick makes what appear to be weekly visits bringing groceries but also rapes Joy whenever he comes over. There's no escape from the room that only has one skylight window since Old Nick is the only one who knows the numbers to the combination lock to enter. Jack is born as a result of Old Nick violating Joy and it's her son that's the only thing keeping her alive. The child does remarkably well despite growing up in such a deprived environment. Joy teaches Jack how to make a birthday cake and he plays with the limited amount of objects found in the room‚Äîoccasionally Old Nick might bring the boy a present (such as an electric model car). There are of course tensions between mother and son‚ÄîJoy doesn't react well when Jack throws a tantrum for example. The best part of the picture is the way in which Joy and Jack are rescued from this abominable situation--but unfortunately it's not all that believable. Joy's plan is to have Jack pretend that he's dead and instruct him how to escape from inside a rolled up rug after Old Nick drives away in his pickup to dispose of the "body." The entire escape is predicated on Old Nick's decision not to check to see if Jack is really dead‚Äîas the scene plays out, Old Nick inexplicably backs off after Joy screams at him not to look at Jack because (as she explains it to him), she can't stomach the idea of the pervert touching her dead son. The subsequent way in which Jack miraculously escapes from Old Nick's truck and the heart- pounding way in which the police figure out where the little boy came from, make up for the slow-moving turn of events in Act One. The second half of Room does not have the rising tension found in the first. The focus on how all the family members adjust is what the second half of Act Two is all about. Joy returns home to find her mother Nancy divorced from her father Robert, and now married to Leo. There is an underdeveloped subplot involving Robert who is repulsed by the idea that Jack was conceived through rape and that his father was pervert Old Nick. Robert goes home to an out of state residence and his catalog of resentments remain unexplored. A better subplot involves the intrusion of the media upon Joy and the rest of the family. Joy agrees to give an interview to a reporter for money and she asks her painful questions about what went on with Old Nick and whether she made the right decision in raising Jack and depriving him of a normal childhood (the suggestion is made that she could have convinced Old Nick to leave the newborn Jack anonymously at a hospital).  Conflict develops between Joy and Nancy and eventually there's the rather predictable trope of Joy attempting suicide. Most critics found Jack's acclimation to his new found world to be touching and cathartic. When he bonds with Leo's dog and a new pal next door, all seems right with the world. And even Joy is seen getting herself together at film's end. So what is one to think of all this? It's a story that I suppose holds one's interest to the end; although the central twist (i.e. the escape), feels contrived. While the young Jacob Tremblay did a fine job playing Jack, his successful adjustment to the outside world feels to me much more schematic than cathartic, as many critics insist. As for Brie Larson, calls for her to win an Oscar for best actress seem misplaced--although her performance is fine given the pedestrian script. In the end, Room rises to the level of an average Lifetime movie, with a few interesting twists and turns here and there but more predictable elements making up the bulk of the overall proceedings.And the Award for Best Drama for Housewives Goes to¬Ö¬Ö It's hard to get revenge on a bad movie. I am partially consoled considering I snuck into this theater rather than paying for a ticket. Still, this subversion robbed me of the cathartic argument over my refund with some hapless manager. Room stole two hours of my life, and the only way I am going to get value from that experience is to get the last word.  Room has an extremely fertile premise. An unnamed woman (Brie Larson) has been kidnapped and imprisoned in a shed for seven years, five of which she has spent raising her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). I am unaware how the book navigated this premise, but author and screenwriter Emma Donoghue had a bottomless potential of directions and selected none. The writing is too shallow to be a thought experiment on trauma or a character study. The narrative is too muddled by loose ends to be a simple "feel good" movie. Cult classic The Room had a similar degree of cohesion¬Ö yeah okay no it didn't. Poor contractually obligated jokes aside, Room is simply aimless. This child grows up in a 10x10 room surrounded by sexual abuse his entire life and his lone complications are a paleness, shyness, and poor grammar. I have met children with comparable behavior from normal households. Children might be plastic, but no one is going to manage a full swift recovery from being born into this environment. The mother character is better explored, but barely. The strength of this woman while kidnapped is unbelievable, but interesting questions are raised after the escape. Her relationship with her parents, her friends, and dealing with new realties are all introduced and either dropped or solved off screen. This is a device derived from the book where everything is seen through Jack's perspective. But post-escape Jack is just cute and boring, not worth following. His narration of events is insufferable. The conclusion of Room is sickening. The film has the audacity to propose that mother and son will be able to leave this experience behind in the closing moments. This claim is beyond ignorant and well into insulting. For the sake of critical fairness I will mention all the two and a half things I enjoyed. The escape sequence is genuinely thrilling. Putting a child in peril is often a cheap way to manipulate the audience. It worked here, so credit is due. Second, the cinematography in the room itself was surprising. I think most films would have tried for a more claustrophobic. Instead, the dimensions are simply defined and unjudged. The abrupt camera pans while Jack is running from wall to wall brilliantly reflects the mindset of these trapped characters. This place is simultaneously small and their entire world; traversing the room is trivial, but also the greatest possible distance. The one victory achieved by the closing scene is the brief moment perfect perspective when the room is seen from the outside. Finally, the acting was serviceable. It is hard to completely differentiate the awful roles from performances, but the film did dodge some melodrama.  The Oscars successfully suckered me into watching Room. I would like to just chuck this movie atop a pile of other examples where the illustrious academy failed, but I am apparently in the minority. There are some aspects of quality filmmaking here, but there is no prize for best drama for housewives. Room took a premise ripe with potential and failed to nurture it with a drop of ingenuity or realism. I was disappointed, and I refuse to believe I am the only one.Boring and nonsensical A woman and her son are held in a garden shed, referred to as 'room', by a man who uses the woman as his sex slave, having abducted her 7 years earlier. The woman concocts a plan to smuggle the son out in order for him to find help and free them. After the plan is successfully executed, we follow the two in the aftermath of the ordeal, struggling to retrieve the life that was previously stolen from her. The film is repetitive and annoying. At no point is the captivity nor the woman's response to the situation believable. It's just a garden shed located in some suburb instead of underground. The woman's not shackled and can virtually escape every time the captor enters the room.  Relying on child actors is a notoriously shaky endeavour and again the constant whining of the kid and the way it talks, is grating and tiresome. There also seems to be no real connect between the first and second act. The 7 years she previously spent in the room might just as well have been a written premise at the start of the film. With no deeper layers to the film and with no character really fleshed out, the film feels aimless and not well thought-through. 3/10ROOM is an Emotional Juggernaut; One of 2015's Top Films Lenny Abrahamson directed one of the best hidden gems of 2014 in FRANK, a strange little film starring Domhnall Gleeson and Michael Fassbender about an indie band getting an unpleasant taste of mainstream success. It was a dark comedy with some real emotion sown into it. A year later, Abrahamson returns with a new film where he goes straight for the heart with a vengeance in ROOM. This man is one of the best directors I've found for emotional impact, keeping in mind I've seeing nothing else of his work but the two mentioned. But there is no denying the emotional gut punch you get watching ROOM. Based on a source novel from author Emma Donoghue (who also penned the script), it's a disturbing (and eventually uplifting) tale told primarily from the perspective of little Jack (Jacob Tremblay). As the movie begins, Jack is awakening for his fifth birthday in Room, the only world he knows. He was born in Room lived in it all his life with his mom (Brie Larson). He's a relatively happy child who believes Room to encompass the entirety of the world. Except, now that he's five, his mom believes it's time for him to know the truth. Seven years prior, she had been tricked and abducted by the man he knows only as Old Nick, the mysterious visitor who comes at night while Jack's asleep to bring food and supplies. Old Nick locked Jack's mom in the little 11' x 11' garden shed and she's been trapped there ever since. Now that Jack is getting older, his mom wants him to help them escape to freedom. ROOM is divided into two distinct halves: inside Room and outside Room. The first half of the movie is arguably the best material in my opinion. It paints a picture of daily life for Jack and his mom, giving the audience a glimpse into their meager existence. Ma tries to make the best of a bad situation for Jack but there's only so much she can do. Until now, Jack has had zero knowledge of a world beyond the walls. He believes TV shows are from other planets, believes common things like trees and dogs are make-believe, and addresses every item in Room as if it were one of his best friends. While Ma has done her best to keep Jack somewhat normalized and happy, she isn't faring as well. She's been beaten, tortured, and raped. She's been trapped in this room for seven years with only a small skylight in the ceiling giving her a glimpse of the natural sky. There are days when the pressure just gets to be too much; Jack calls them her "gone days" when she lies in bed, not moving or speaking a word. It's a nerve-wracking first half to a film and ramps up to the eventual escape planning. Again, the emotional gut punches keep coming as Ma realizes she will likely have to put her son in mortal danger if she ever hopes of getting him out of there with the chance of a normal life. Meanwhile, Jack is confused and scared out of his wits. His mom has turned his entire world upside down with talk of how there is an enormous world outside the four walls and how all those things he believed imaginary are real. The second half of the movie loses a little steam because we don't have the built-in tension that comes with a captive and her son living in a box with an unstable kidnapper, but it delves into life after Room. It shows how Ma and Jack begin to adjust to the real world. To Jack, of course, this is more than his mind can process at first. I mean, the kid has never seen a horizon before and now he's faced with new environments, new experiences, and new people. While Jack does have his own troubles acclimating to the new life, Ma seems to have it worse. She seems all right at the start, relieved to be free and happy to return to normality, but after seven years of that sort of tortuous existence, normal doesn't come easy. Her parents have since divorced and her own mother has an old friend as her new live-in boyfriend. Her father has moved away and returns to reconnect with his long-lost daughter, but he has trouble accepting Jack and his¬Öwell¬Öorigins. Brie Larson does a phenomenal job with this material. Ma is a complex, deeply troubled character and Larson positively nails it with a very natural, genuine performance. She deserved every award she brought home for this role. Equal accolades belong to young Jacob Tremblay. In my experiences, the grand majority of child actors turn in stiff, unnatural performances but there are exceptions and Tremblay is top of the list. I believed every moment of his performance in ROOM and it's a real accomplishment for both him and director Abrahamson. ROOM is undoubtedly one of the best movies from 2015 (again, my opinion but I strongly believe so) and it comes with a strong recommendation from me. You'd have to be pretty dead inside for this movie to have not even the slightest emotional effect on you.Unintentionally insulting This is the movie that happens every year that isn't good, but wins critical acclaim by being distinct and including a child actor. It's disturbing, but without the tact required by the writing. Now to spoil things. A woman is held hostage as a sex slave for seven years and at some point has a baby boy, who she convinces the "Room" is the entire world. During this they play uplifting music and it is absolutely tonally daft. Once they escape Room they are better off. Then, "Ma" feels bad about how horribly she treated her son and thus tries to kill herself, to make it all better. Also, the boy in this movie looks and sounds exactly like a girl and has long hair. So I'm expecting maybe "Ma" lied that it was a boy, so her kid wouldn't be a rape target. Nope. Toward the end you realize it's a boy, and you go, "Whoa, why was I distracted by that for absolutely no reason?" Then, they revisit Room. And Ma feels better. Because going to where you were repeated raped for seven years makes you happy. Absurd, ridiculous, fantastical film that is unintentionally insulting.Room is not as good as everyone says it is. Room stars Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. It offers Larson her best performance of her career and Tremblay a break out role. While he may not quite get past the whole "kid actor" stereotype he is admittedly better than almost every other child actor out there today. Both of these actors are receiving some serious awards buzz right now, as is this film in general. This may be due to the odd nature of its plot line. A mother and child are stuck inside a room for at least five years of their lives. Trapped inside never once going out to see or experience the world. So, when they get out we watch as this child gets to see everything for the first time. Yes it's an interesting plot that hasn't really been done before but it can't really pull it off. It's odd that it struggles so bad with making this a worthy adaption of the book seeing as the author actually wrote the film. Much like last years 'Gone Girl'. However 'Gone Girl' actually had a good director. The one other film this director had done was 'Frank'. So I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, he may have proved to us that he is a one hit wonder. Because this film is not near as good as everyone is saying. This mainly steams from sloppy writing. Writing that would've probably worked in a book format. In that format you are able to show characters thoughts and feelings far easier than in film so you have to write accordingly. But this doesn't happen. This is really the only reason this film fails. But it fails hard. From the first scenes of the film it was pretty clear that not enough thought went into making this a piece of cinema. Characters actions and reactions to everything feel absurdly artificial. Like a cop figuring out where the room they lived in was from one extremely vague sentence. Or how the film seems to pretend like these two had never made one single escape attempt. Literally the second escape they try gets them out. I couldn't help think that they had never actually tried, because the guy didn't even hesitate to buy into their trick. In fact not one person in this film reacts naturally. Everyone was an extreme version of a normal person and it made nearly everyone in the film super unlikable. Especially the main two characters. They did virtually nothing aside from scream at whoever they wanted for no apparent reason.  Almost every conversation ended in an annoying screaming match between random people. A screaming match that either made no sense or just made you dislike the characters. So, when these two get out it's hard to legitimately care about them. You don't know anything about them other then the fact that they liked yelling for no reason. 'Room' may have strong performances and an interesting idea to back it up but not much else. It has a hard time making you actually care about its characters. No one reacts like a human being but instead yells at each other when ever they feel like they need to. It wastes its best qualities with a limp and lifeless script that fails to appropriately adapt the acclaimed novel.Overly unrealistic and lacking depth The movie has its moving moments, especially the emblematic one with the kid staring in awe at the newly discovered world, but that's about it. The story is overly unrealistic and both the psychological drama and the physical misery lack depth. 17-year-old girl is kidnapped with the lure that some sick dog needs her attention. This is followed by 7 years of imprisonment in a backyard shed (the so-called "Room") and regular raping, which ‚Äì in the second year ‚Äì produces a child. The mother accepts the fruit of the relationship (named Jack) without reservations and from that moment on her only goal is to keep it safe. A goal in which she succeeds with flying colors. And so, no matter his complete isolation, the misery of his existence, and the fact that he is a constant, although unconscious, witness of his mother's abuse, at 5 Jack is both mentally and physically healthy, even happy child, he has smooth skin and complex reactions and the only sign of his unusual circumstances is his long hair... I didn't even have to use irony ‚Äì the whole thing is flat enough on its own. Actually, I see it as an insult to anyone who have lived through "the Room trauma" ‚Äì be it real, or more metaphoric. It sets ridiculous standards for the victims while what they truly need is understanding and compassion. But yeah, let's say that mother's love conquers it all and clap our hands.Unique, endearing, magnificent A beautifully spectacular film with an interesting plot that carries past the viewer's expectation-excellent! A heartwarming piece of authentic artwork-well worth a watch; a film of great significance carrying important values of today's society.dismal attempt at tugging on heart-strings Considering the horrific subject matter, this movie managed to come over as glossy, superficial, and above all it was determined to be emotionally manipulative at every opportunity. I'm sorry but since when was kidnap, imprisonment and prolonged abuse as cosy and sentimental as this? In what way does this movie attempt to truly confront its audience with the raw, vile atrocity of its subject matter? It didn't need to be ultra-explicit visually, but 'Room' was presented more like a hankies-at-the-ready emo weepfest than a genuinely harrowing study in cruelty and repression. As for the 2nd half of the movie, the attempts at scenes of angsty/shouty family drama and turmoil were from the straight-to-DVD standard school of acting. All in all a bland, boring and forgettable excercise in hollywood 'realism'.Too realistic A pure drama film The film is so realistic, the thoughts the ideas the acting the scenes.... which make the film good and watchable The only scene i felt the real drama with action and suspense was the escape scene, the rest of the film after, is very boring and waste of time I think this film is overratedGreat movie The movie is really good, it tells the story in a very good way, it makes you feel connected to the film's world. I love this movie. I just think they could tell more of what happened later, I mean, it makes want to know the rest of the story, how their life goes on. I mean, it is so good it does that.Based on a true incident This film is based on a true incident in 2008. Jack, five years old, long hair lives in "room" with her mother. They live to cook, clean the room and do physical exercises from day to day. Things in the room are all the world for Jack. Jack thinks what happens on the TV is fancy. Sometimes a strange man comes into the room and leaves some foods. One day his mother, Joy tells Jack the truth. There is a real world outside this room. Jack gets confused, but Joy attempts to escape from the room¬Ö I think that the real thrill of this film starts since Jack and Joy has get away from the room. How can they accept outside world? How can they get used to live outside world? This theme is so big, principal and deep in this film.Excellent movie This is a suspense movie. The main character is Joy and Jack. Joy is mother of Jack and has been incarcerated for 7 years. Jack is the five years old and don't know the outside world at all. They have been locked in a small room for a long time. In order to escape from the room, they take action in a certain way. However, when they get out of the room, there is also a problem they have to confront. I feel that their performance look completely real. I strongly recommend this movie.Compelling Story Topped with Some Amazing Acting and Great Camera-work It was on my watch-list since long and had a chance to watch it finally last weekend. Room is an interesting story of a 5-year-old boy's interpretation of the real world as it comes face to face with it after circumstances force him to be confined in a small room, totally isolated from the outside world, for the first five years of his life. The movie released in 2015.  Story (10/10): Jack and Ma are being confined to a small room by their abductor who kidnapped Ma before Jack was born. Jack hasn't seen the real world - for him, there is no real world that exists outside the room - as explained by Ma who protects him from the abductor at all costs. She also makes sure he has everything he needs even within that small space. However, as he turns 5 and his curiosity about the world increases, Ma realizes it's time to introduce Jack to the world he needs to be a part of. As they implement their escape plan, lead by Jack, he encounters the real world - people, animals, natural phenomena, technology and a lot more. All his notions are challenged at once. The large part of the story is how the relationship between Ma and Jack changes as Jack, now, has a lot of questions for Ma - a little too much to handle for a young mother. However, Jack never gives up on his mother - the only person he trusts blindly in this world - as he slowly adjusts to the real world. While Jack adjusts to the real world, Ma finds herself understanding and adjusting to the new realities, emerged while she was abducted, that adds to her frustration.  Acting (9/10): Without a doubt, Jacob Tremblay, playing Jack was the star of the movie and pretty much shouldered it. His acting was top notch as a confused lad who is in dilemma of what to believe and what not. Brie Larson had a tough role to play with a combination of multiple emotions at once sometimes. She was great to watch. Joan Allen made her presence felt in the supporting cast, playing Ma's mother and trying to connect with Jack. Some of her scenes with Jack are really touching as she becomes his second confidant after Ma. William Macy, playing Ma's father, has a very brief role to play compared to Joan Allen.  Direction (9/10): Lenny Abrahamson excelled at telling a touching and a compelling story. His use of the camera in the opening scenes to project claustrophobia was impressive. The movie starts off as a little dark and depressing but it kind of opens up as Jack comes out of "The Room". While the central focus of the movie was Jack's association with Ma, Lenny also projected Jack's association with the room itself which starts from the opening scene and ends in the last scene. What I loved was the way that closure was brought. In addition, while the movie is very emotional, the melodrama has been almost nil - which made it very realistic. Overall, a very impressive effort.  Overall (9/10): A great movie for a compelling story topped up with some amazing acting by the lead cast and great camera work.Excellent moving film Jack is the boy who lives in the shed with his mother and he was born and raised there so he has never seen real outer world through his eyes. He and his mother were shut up by Jack's father, but one day, she finally decided to try to escape. The story of is based on real incident called Fritzl case, but the story doesn't progresses following that case accurately. Therefore, the story is half-original but it is a great moving story. I think it was difficult to imagine that situation, but the screenwriter well and realistically wrote life in a shed and first facing with real outer world. You'll understand after watching this, the story about not only Jack but also his mother actually. The bond of them and their growth literally moved me. Moreover, the actors well show characters' emotion even Jacob Tremblay who acted Jack. He was 8 years old when this film was shot, but he really well acted that difficult role I can't believe. The Fritzl case was a terrible incident but making team was managed to make such a great film. 10 out of 10 of course.Amazing and breathtaking movie! I did not know what kind of expectations to have before watching this movie. But now, when I've seen it, I must say; WOW! Amazing acting, very realistic and serious story... the way it is all filmed and how the story is told is just about perfect! And Jacob Tremblay is probably the best kid we've seen acting (or at least one of the best).  Another positive thing about this movie is that it does not only tell the story of being prisoners and the escape - but also the life after; adapting to "reality". Once again; how could I have missed this until now?Unmissable. So brilliant and full of natural emotions. One of the best movies I have ever seen. So impressed by the acting, story and direction. The emotions shown and state of mind depicted are so so original that it makes the movie unique. Movie taught me being free and happy is also tough. You have to learn that as well. You will cry a lot for sure. Enjoy.This movie really shows the sorrow out of the characters This movie is based on how a mother and a child live half of their lives locked away in a Room. This movie is narrated from the child's point of view, thinking that out of the room there is nothing but space. The actors really do a great job showing the sorrow of living in a Room. This movie really makes you think how we humans are violent against our own species.Best film I've seen for years If I could give this film more than 10 I would. This is only my second review but had to write something as it's so good.The acting is first class as is the story line. I've yet to see Brie Larson in a film but after watching Room, I can see why she is so highly rated. What I also enjoyed was the way the director concentrated on the struggle of the family after the events which is sometimes missed during these type of films. Room will be enjoyed by all film fans.Excellent Movie I will admit I did not want to go to see this. I thought oh great another chick flick I am getting drug to. Well within a very short time my mind was changed and I never budged from my seat. Not sure I blinked. Jacob Tremblay was magnificent in this movie first of all. The plot was gripping and had you wanting so much for help to hurry up and find them. This movie showed the lengths a mother will go to for the child she loves so desperately. I would watch this movie over and over again and it is certainly not just a chick flick but something everyone needs to see. If you have not seen it you missed the best movie of the year. Go rent it.Shocking, emotional and creative Room was an impressive from the start, it unveiled more and more mystery and intrigue as it went on. In the confines of a small room and space a great story of struggle, sacrifice and sadness is conveyed. The film is effective in getting the viewer to formulate numerous thoughts as to why a young mother and her son exist in this small room. We gradually wonder until a shocking and unspeakable truth is revealed to us. After this revelation a number of things makes sense. Like little Jack is slowly coming to terms with reality it gradually sets in for the audience. Lenny Abrahamson cleverly keeps his audience within the confines of that room until he reveals its cruel reality. Its a shocking truth to most who perhaps conjured up all kinds of science fiction related reasons, the reality is bleak.  The first half of Room was suspenseful, intriguing and became increasingly poignant as it went on. The strength of the film was in the build up and longing of the mother and her son to escape into the world. The second part of Room while pleasing at the start took a dive as the mother went through emotional turmoil and took the audience through this sad journey. The film wasn't long enough to explore the long ranging effects and aftermath such entrapment would have on the mother and son. Hence it was an unnecessary emotional downward spiral. If the film had built up the need for escape, the difficulty of it and painted a fairy tale picture of the outside it might have been even better. Escape happened far too soon, perhaps this could have been prolonged and intensified so when they finally escaped it would have been a lot more rewarding and satisfying. The outside and final scenes could have been drastically shortened to show a happy and free mother and son.  Overall a decent film, Brie Larson gives a stellar performance and one can see why she earned the Academy Award for best actress.  7.5/10Nothing short of amazing * Loved this movie!I saw this film on Frebuary 17 but you know I'm not much a science-fiction fan but I quite enjoyed this one, he his pretty good and incredible The movie centers around a girl and his best friends, the girl got a power and she has to live with and to use it properly. The boy is an only child and he lost his mother in a car accident so he has to live with his widowed father. Gwendoline try to help his friend the best she can, and a miracle appears The acting of the mains characters Clara Busin and Pierre Foliot was really great, Clara gives a beautiful and very convincing performance, especially during the more emotional scenes. There were moments in The dreaming girl that were so intense that I barely breathe. He is a gripping movie that will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions, but it's well worth the ride !!!!Moving This movie moves you. It is a story of Jack and his mother Joe living their lives in a room for more than 5 years. This room is the world for jack. Outside is space. Yet they manage to be happy at times, sad at times, normal at times and angry at times. I was glad the movie did not end with their release from the room. It showed their life in the real world. The amazement of jack at all the simple things we take for granted, yet for him they did not exist just some time ago. The regret, anger and sense of loss of Joe. How Jack was still attached to the room which was now a crime seen, but for him, his childhood venue. (which again we take for granted, but for him now was almost inaccessible). I connected with the characters in the movie which are very well played.  In the end, the movie to me is about a story of how much there is around us, the value of which we realize only when its taken away.Wonderful I remember seeing Brie Larson in a little movie called Short Term 12 and thinking this was a star in the making. She was absolutely brilliant in this movie. Combined with Abrahamson's strong direction, this movie was gripping from start to finish. So great to see a film at this budget level achieve so many deserved accolades."We're never anywhere but here." One has to stay with the film a good long while before anything of an uplifting nature comes along. The first part of the story dealing with Ma (Brie Larson) and son Jack's (Jacob Tremblay) isolation is claustrophobic, depressing and downright creepy at times. Their situation would seem nearly impossible to comprehend, though by now we've had real life examples of similar abductions in which the monstrous perpetrator fathers a child. Consider the cases of Jaycee Dugard and Amanda Berry, both hidden away, virtually in plain sight, as is the case depicted in this film. I found some of the story's concepts interesting, such as young Jack's distorted concept of space and time after exposure to a 'normal' life. The business with the hair and offering the 'strong' to his mother was a unique parallel to the mythology of Samson, and I thought that was cleverly done. I'm on the fence as to why Jack would want to go back to visit 'Room' once he sampled a safe and loving environment, and found it even more baffling that the local police department agreed to accompany him and Ma there. I'm gratified I stayed with the picture because straining through the early part of the story was very disturbing. This isn't the type of movie one ought to consider for entertainment, as the physical and mental abuse suffered by Ma was as harrowing an ordeal as one might find in a war or hostage film. And even though the story ends on a positive note, it's not with a feeling of joy that one eventually comes away with.One of the best movies I've ever seen Beautiful in every way. The relationship between the mother and son is so real, you can feel it through the screen. This is a gut wrenching movie and you will likely not get away with a dry eye but it is so worth it. At times, you forget it's a movie because it feels so real. The acting is so amazing given such a difficult situation to portray. I believe Jacob Tremblay deserved an Oscar nomination for completely nailing this complex performance at such a young age. Brie Larson hands down deserved her best actress win. This is a movie I will recommend to everyone I meet, it's THAT good.good! Brie larson plays a woman who has been kidnapped when she was a teenager and has been used for sex by her kidnapper "old jack",she raises then a boy"jack",who knew nothing about life but room and ma. the woman seems so used to her situation as a prisoner ,that we don't notice real pain neither suffering,rather the rhythm is so quiet and monotone,we sense boredom and quiet electric atmosphere. the woman(Brie Larson),s only interest is to take care of her child,she even over cares (has anxiety crises and manifests overprotective behavior). "jack"is a normal kid,who likes to play and is very curious,may get offensive with his ma in times, once old enough to understand and concentrate ,jack could serve to get both him and his ma out of room? how is the world outside ?for ma who s been imprisoned for 7 years ,and for jack who only knows the world through TV ? first contact,first stranger,first look on everything as we know it ,as we're used to it,how is life after room ,if there is ever gonna be one ? go and see the movie,you'll get the answers,...i guess...Jacob was so much better than Brie I wanted to see it when i first heard that Miss Larson took the Oscar.Nice film but for me at least she did not deserve it.Jacob Tremblay who deserved it,did not even have a nomination.Why??His performance was perfect and he was the one who made the film successful.So i suggest see it,but not for Brie Larson.She just payed for the Oscar or as we all know she probably did worse things to win it. I also liked some scenes.When Joy committed suicide,it was Jack who was strong for both of them.Also,you expect that when they are free,everything will be easy.But it appears that it is not.So i give a 7 for the script and of course young Jacob.I totally recommend this movie. I'm in fond of the main actress. Without revealing the truth, this movie comes in our heart directly so much. We are curious about the fact, that because of that, we just focus on the relationship between their family, not the kidnapper. Also the boy is so brilliant and smart. His angry face has a lot of power. I totally recommend this movie.A masterpiece! One of the best films i have seen in a long time. Spinning all of your emotions around one after another. Brie Larson truly reserved to win the academy award for best actress. This truly is a must watch, the story of a young boy and his mother locked away for years and there battle to survive.stripped of the melodrama that hurts most films Another very original movie with a familiar story plot, but concentrates more on the effects of the trauma on the human psyche then any kind of clich√©d melodrama. Most movies wouldn't dare to delve as deep as Room does into the effect that a horrifying event can have on a family and the tough choices that people must make which aren't choices at all, but the brutality of life. These two main characters, played brilliantly and unglamorously by Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley, never had a chance at a normal life.Inspiring OMG! Absolutely exceptional. The acting is superb especially from a child. And the connection between mother and son is breath taking. I'm not normally " moved" by movie but this one has touched my soul. I have to say (and I'm very hard to please) the most captivating film I've seen in a long timeEmotionally moving, captivating and well made This story about a young mother, stuck in captivity with her innocent five-year old son, is among the finest shown in cinema over these past couple of years. Though there is a glimpse into the horrors of being what it's like to experience being locked up by a twisted, cruel captor for many years inside his small garden shed, the plot also emphasises the struggles they face when having to face the real world that lays outside of 'Room'. Yet through it all, the deep and unbreakable bond between Ma and her little boy, Jack, which punctuates virtually every scene, is what makes this film so moving and never ceases to uplift. Brie Larson's performance as Ma is absolutely phenomenal; her portrayal as this woman protecting her little boy while battling the gut-wrenching struggles of being stuck inside Room, and then facing the difficulties of transitioning back to the outside world is so beautifully authentic. It was no surprise, and certainly no injustice, that she gained a 100% deserved Oscar win for Best Actress that year. Jacob Tremblay's portrayal as this sheltered, innocent little boy born into this dark world without a full awareness of what's truly going on is also fantastic. The outstanding chemistry between Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay is a huge contributing factor in successfully bringing across this story onto screen. But aside from the emotionally powerful storyline and excellent acting of the two leads, it is also a brilliantly shot film. Lenny Abrahamson fully deserved his Best Director nomination at the Oscars (despite never standing a chance against the likes of Inarittu that year) as he makes excellent use of cinematography, editing and set design to give an authentic picture of the character's perspective of what Room would be like, as well as the outside world later on. Some of the shots are truly beautiful, in spite of the lack of flashy special effects or lavish set design. Just in case you thought this film would only be good for its acting or emotional capacity, it is a genuinely well filmed movie. It's great to see that this film on the IMDB Top 250 list, that it's at least come close to getting it's deserved recognition. I would confidently proclaim this as one of the best films of this decade, right up there with the likes of Inception and 12 Years a Slave, not something many people would say.Terrific Thriller with Great Performances Room (2015)  **** (out of 4) A mother (Brie Larson) and her five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live in a small room where the mom eventually decides to try and get out of the room so that her son can have a better life. I'm really not going to say much more about the plot because it's really best that you go into the film just knowing the simplest detail and that's the fact that the mom and son are living inside a small room. I must admit that I went into this movie with high hopes and they were not only met but easily surpassed. Director Lenny Abrahamson once again shows that you don't need a one hundred million dollar budget in order to make a great film. No, ROOM shows what great directing, great acting and a great story can do. What really amazed me about the film is the way Abrahamson was able to make you feel trapped by the surroundings. The first portion of the movie all takes place inside this small room and this room is really a character of its own. What makes the film so special is the fact that you get accustom to this small room and you can feel for both of the characters and understand what they're going through. This first portion also works as a terrific mystery because you don't know why they're in this room and slowly the mystery is revealed. The film turns into a remarkable character study during the second act. Again, I'm not going to spoil any of the twists so lets just say that the mother, the son and others are so torn from what happened that it's remarkable watching the actors bring these characters to life. The various troubles that follow is something hard to watch at times but certainly impossible to forget. Brie Larson turns in a terrific performance and only after viewing the film will you see and understand how many different emotions she has to play. She easily becomes this character and there's not a single frame where you feel that you're watching an actress work. No, instead you really do feel as if you're seeing a real character going through these real hardships. Tremblay turns in one of the greatest child performances I've ever seen and especially when you look at how challenging the role and film are. Both Larson and Tremblay have a terrific chemistry that really comes across wonderfully on the screen. William H. Macy, Joan Allen, Matt Gordon and Sean Bridgers are all terrific as well. ROOM deals with a very troubling subject matter and the film really doesn't pull any punches. The subject matter turns more ugly with each new twist but in the end you're seeing one of the best character developments in recent years as well as some of the greatest acting that you're going to see. It's really remarkable what the director managed to pull off but ROOM is certainly a great gem.Claustrophobic beauty That review summary may sound very oxymoronic, but to me it applies to a film such as 'Room'. A film with a difficult subject, that is the stuff of nightmares, but tells it so beautifully with an interesting approach that works better than all the potential traps that films of its genre could fall under. What could have easily have been told in a lurid, gratuitous way (being inspired by the true-life case of Josef Fritzl) is instead told in a careful and restrained way. There is even an innocence in 'Room', due to its very fascinating decision to tell it from the viewpoint of a five year old, in this case Jack, one that comes off very movingly and gives a sense that there is a little ray of hope in a seemingly hopeless situation. The source material, equally brilliant, is to be thanked here, its author Emily Donoghue adapts it to screen here and none of its power is lost.  Really appreciated the careful and restrained approach to the storytelling in 'Room', and for me and many others it was something different considering the subject. It does though affect some of the pacing in the middle act, where a little of the tension seen in especially the first part is lost a little.  For my tastes too, though it probably did fit the film's younger and more innocent viewpoint it's told from, the music score does lay it on too thick with the treacle. However, loved how the story was told and its approach. What 'Room' also strongly benefitted from being told this way was that the mother and son relationship was able to shine through and really resonate, which it may not have done as effectively with a heavier tone. And shine through it does, with great charm and poignancy. Also appreciated that none of the characters were painted too black and white, even Old Nick.  Production values are effectively claustrophobic and the nocturnal parts chillingly nightmarish. 'Room' is beautifully directed by someone who understood how claustrophobic thrillers worked, how mother and son bonds do in dire situations do and the ability to combine both to ensure a powerful experience. A directing job that's both unsettling and empathetic. Similarly 'Room' is written with effortless skill and deft thoughtfulness.  Can't find anything to fault the performances. The superb one of Brie Larson, that was a very worthy Oscar (Golden Globe and Bafta too) win in her category, is an obvious starting point, but one mustn't overlook the beyond-his-years turn of young Jacob Tremblay, one of the best child acting performances in recent years, and William H Macy and Joan Allen both giving some of their best work in years. Sean Bridgers also gives much more to what could have been a standard clich√© role. Overall, great powerful film but the somewhat fascinatingly unconventional (for the genre) way the story was told won't work for some. 9/10 Bethany CoxHateful characters I watched ROOM because I'm a fan of Irish director Lenny Abrahamson, that's the only reason. The premise didn't really appeal to me, although I'm aware that it's based on various true stories about long-term captivity; if I'm honest I'd rather watch a documentary about one of the cases rather than this attempted fictionalised version. And, truth be told, I didn't like ROOM very much at all. The premise is okay, but there are two problems with this. The first is the running time: at two hours, ROOM is a film which is dragged out. I couldn't help but think it would have worked better as a thirty minute short. I thought the first half was bad, but once the characters actually get out, it really stalls. I know they'll struggle to adapt to society, I can work that out for myself, but I didn't need to see all those dragged-out moments and relationships with other characters. The second problem is that I hated the characters in this film, and not just the villains you're supposed to hate. Brie Larson gives a non-performance as the lead and the only thing they got right was in making her skin look manky. She's unsympathetic to me, a mother who seems to take a perverse delight in putting her child into danger over and over again, and I found her behaviour quite disgusting. With a proper actress giving a proper performance I might have liked this more. Even worse is the kid: a typically bratty American child whose overbearing and obnoxious attitude makes him no different from all the others we see in the movies. Why do American kids seem so selfish, self-obsessed, and prone to tantrums? Due to this child, the only thing ROOM did for me was to give me a headache. A pity, as Abrahamson's earlier movies ADAM AND PAUL and WHAT RICHARD DID were both very interesting, while this and FRANK have by comparison been chores to sit through.brilliant performances In a small room, Ma (Brie Larson) is celebrating the fifth birthday of her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). There are no windows except for a skylight and no obvious door. Jack's understanding of the outside world is limited. It's soon obvious that they are prisoners of a man they called Old Nick. Ma finally tells Jack that her name is Joy Newsome and she was taken when she was 17 some 7 years ago. Jack angrily disbelieves at first. Joy comes up with a daring gamble to escape back to her parents (Joan Allen, William H. Macy). This is a star-making role for Brie Larson. Her performance in 'Short Term 12' is amazing but little seen. She once again delivers a top-notch performance. She has inner strength and humanity. Jacob Tremblay is a wonderful discovery with his squeaky little voice. It's an almost perfect little film. I was wondering where this movie was going at certain points in the middle but I think it ends in the perfect place.Emotional and compelling stuff thanks to the tight focus on well written and performed characters Driven mostly by the initially intriguing concept, this film surprised me by resolving this around this mid-point of the film. Not having read the book or really heard anything specific about the film, it did catch me off guard in a small way, since I had come into the film with the specifics of the situation in mind. The first half of the film does make it more than this though, because I was drawn into a relationship which was emotionally raw and compelling. The film uses the limits of the room really well, focusing on the mother/son relationship and making us care about it while also being horrified by the specifics. The second half of the film manages to maintain that engagement, while flipping the characters in such a way that made the drama work in a much different way, and cast a different light on the first half of the film. It is tough in terms of subject matter, but at the same time it is easy to watch because of how well the film draws you into caring about the lead two characters. A big part of this is how well both Larson and Tremblay delivery; they are organic and natural performances, and are supported equally well by the likes of Allen and Macey. The writing and the performances make it, and in the end the film is a lot of heart and works as a result of this.2 great performance and a captivating story "Room" is an American 2-hour movie from last year. The director is Lenny Abramson and writer is Emma Donoghue, who actually adapted her own novel for the screen with this one. Both scored Academy Award nominations for their work with the Best Director slot certainly being the more surprising feat. The movie also got in for Best Picture and won lead actress Brie Larsen an Oscar, just like basically all precursors. Jacob Tremblay, however was the real lead here and it is absolutely ridiculous that he was nominated for so many supporting awards. Voiceovers are usually a good indicator who is in the center of the story and we hear him at the very beginning and end for example. Also there are key scenes where we still find out about him while his mother is out of the picture, such as the successful escape or after his mother tries to commit suicide. But this should not mean that Larson isn't lead. She is as well, but only the second lead despite being credited first. I believed this film delivered on many areas, such as emotion and drama most importantly. The escape inside the carpet was downright thrilling from start to finish until the very moment we realize he succeeded. Butg even the the tension stays high as we do not know what happened to his mother. Did he kill her or not. The consequence of these scenes is also the emotion in here. The moments when Larson's runs towards the car with her son inside is really moving and there are more scenes like that, such as the way they meet the grandparents or also the scene with the boy and the dog towards the end. You will be amazed by these and it is really difficult to hold the tears back. This is a very tragic, yet very uplifting film at the same time, but certainly more of the latter. The scenes early on in the prison do not seem as sad as they really are as we see everything through the eyes of the son. It starts right away inside the shack and I initially thought the woman actually has a mental disorder because of which she won't leave the place and the guy coming occasionally is somebody who provides them with the necessary items in exchange for sexual pleasure. It is seen a lot more as a prison when the action moves outside, which is roughly the entire second half of the film. I personally think that there are a couple scenes that don't add that much really and could have been left out. It is also difficult to say if this film had worked even better if it would have ended with the reunion of the two outside, but I guess it would have been a major (maybe impossible) challenge to make it work for 100 minutes or so. I guess it was best this way. Another flaw I saw with it was the attempted suicide scene I mentioned earlier already. It felt a bit unrealistic drama at this point. Yes it was all too much for her, but she fought for survival for 5 years and then she would do something like that. Of course, the reason was that she had doubts after the reporter asked her why she did not give up on her son inside. But this also would have been her surrender I guess as she certainly would never have gotten outside without him. But yeah, the way the press was depicted in here was generic and standard in a negative way. They could have dealt better with that situation. But despite these criticisms, these almost 120 minutes were a captivating watch and truly flew by. I can see why The Academy turned out to like it that much. Larson and Tremblay shine a lot and it was impossible to say who was better. Okay, I could have done without some parts I mentioned already and also the mother-daughter argument, but these are just minor flaws. In the grand scheme of things, this film worked extraordinarily well and was extremely tense and touching at the same time. I command you to check it out. Highly recommended.what am I missing? I've just returned from the pictures after watching this film. Great performance from the young boy Jack, but doesn't carry the film.Too many unanswered questions and holes in the plot lines. The worst was:-three slows and a stop, and robocopette leads them directly to the shed??? really??? I left the pictures when they found the dog toy behind the settee. probably not a great admission for a reviewer, but it had seemed to have slipped back into maudlin and lethargy. maybe I missed the best bits, but did I really have to get into a state of boredom before I could appreciate it? just because Jacks' like was full of tedium and repetition, doesn't mean the point has to be hammered home so effectively. there is nothing wrong with slow moving films as long as it is effective.films where you wonder whats around the corner rather than hope.I have only left a film once before. Hostel.Ankles. I couldn't watch anymore, and for completely differing reasons, and neither could I tonight.Amazing view of childhood I saw this film as part of the LFF and can't recommend it enough. Even though the subject matter is dark, the film is truly uplifting.  I would recommend even for fans of the book as in my eyes this offered much more. It doesn't have the sense of time you get from the book nor perhaps Ma's desperation but I thought it dealt with the matter beautifully. It wasn't sensational at all where it could have been.  The acting is fantastic, Brie Larson was excellent and I thought she would be good when I heard she was cast as she impressed in short term 12. No disappointments there.  The boy, Jack, was just brilliant, I see so many films where the child actors overact and are over cutesy. He did neither, he was perfect. He really broke my heart with the smallest expressions and quiet words. I would like to see them both nominated for Oscars and this is without doubt one of my films of the year.  Enjoyed this much more than the book. Go see it. It's fantastic. Bring a tissue!Worse than Eastern European Movies What the?....I don't even understand the logic of this movie. So, the boy escapes so easily? What does the crazy man do afterwards? How do they even find his mother??? The rating doesn't make sense. Maybe the idea is good, but something's not realistic about this movie. Do you need this kind of drama? Maybe you should watch something more realistic and well made, maybe an Eastern European movie. And what's with the boy's long hair? A small haircut didn't hurt anybody. I'm a woman and I can't even grow 20 cm of my hair...come on...I skipped so many minutes of this movie, seriously. This genre is much better to watch in Eastern European versions. Watch Eastern European movies. this movie sucks.Dumb Parts One thing I hate are dumb parts of movies.... things that you know just would not be true. And you're not watching a fantasy so... there shouldn't be. Couldn't stand the part where lawyers got involved and acted like the victims would be responsible for prosecution costs. Absolutely idiotic. So if someone commits a crime it wouldn't get prosecuted unless the victim pays? Yeaaaa OK. ABSOLUTELY BRAINLESS. Otherwise good movie, but those completely idiotic occurrences in films, and this one is bad, is inexcusable. Especially as they HAVE to know it's BS but keep it in anyway to try to create more drama. I took of one star for that but it's annoying me so much right now I want to take of more...Interrupted lives For us adults, our childhood room was a place of great memorabilia: where we used to study, play and hear stories from our parents before going to bed. In this Emma Donogue's adaptation, we visualize the ugly side of it, where dreams do not exist, and that any kid would like to erase from his mind. For Jack, 5 years of age, in the shoes of Jack Trembley, the room is all there is. His entire childhood contained in four walls, and the unconditional love of her "ma" (Brie Larson). This movie was a complete challenge, in terms of narrative, a humble room, where a mother and her son switch dialogues to tell us a true story. At certain points one might think it goes slowly, but it manages to finish in a great way. This film was greatly promoted and backed by outstanding supporting actors such as William H. Macy (Fargo 1996) and Joan Allen (nominated for three Academy Awards). Highly recommend if you are looking to have a fine movie afternoon, with great leading performances.Perfection still exists There is not much to say about a film like this. No complicated plot lines, no unnecessary character setups, just a well written story, a camera and a crew that understands what is going on. The acting is probably the best i have seen in years, at no point do you get thrown out of the story. Even though one could argue the filmcould be chopped in half, the acting is so consistent up into the tiniest roles, that at no point you feel like this isn't really happening. the emotional arc from the two leads is enormous, and as an audience you are in it the whole way. If Larson is perfect, then for Tremblay we need to invent a completely new word. The story reveals itself gradually, which is always brilliant as it keeps you busy on what exactly is going on. nothing is nicely 'explained' to you.  to me this did not feel like a story but like a reality show, with a very grim topic all the way through. This is one of those lonely gems in film and let's hope prizes may rain on these actors, writer and director for their enormous efforts. I hope it won't be missed in the bulk of big budget nonsense we had to sit through this year. Don't hear about this film, go see it!The best movie of 2015 "Room" shares the innocent perspective of a 5 year old named Jack who is led to believe by his mother that life consists of being inside a tiny room forever. I can relate this movie with "Life Is Beautiful" and "Pan's Labyrinth" because in all this titles we see a young human with such an innocent perspective and big imagination that somehow softens the cruel reality by tricking the mind and distorting what is actually happening. "Room" also shows the psychology of both of the primary characters after living through a traumatic experience. Jack not being able to walk upstairs since he had never done it before in Room is one example. This movie made me feel grateful about my life because you get to see Jack and his mother happy after all. Torwards the ending of the movie Jack says "since Ma and I don't know what we like, we decided we are going to try everything". That's my favorite part of the movie because it means Jack is finally ready to open himself up and be a part of the big world.The best movie of 2015 (may contain mild spoilers) I would like to start off this review by stating that I have been an IMDb user for nearly five years and have rated hundreds of movies and TV shows, but this is only my first review. I try not to give 10 out of 10 ratings lightly, but Room more than deserved it. I felt so strongly about this film that I was compelled to try writing a review. I did not know much about Room going into the film. All I knew was that a mom and son were confined in a small room 24/7. I was absolutely blown away by nearly every aspect of the film. I'm having trouble thinking of any flaws in the movie. Brie Larson was simply incredible as "Ma". While I have seen many of this years top movies, I have not seen them all. Nevertheless I have a hard time believing that any actress had a better performance. She will certainly be nominated and should win the Oscar for lead actress. Prior to seeing Room I had only seen Larson in supporting roles in movies and TV. I had no idea she was capable of such a performance and I look forward to seeing her in future roles. Not to be outdone was Jacob Tremblay, who played Larson's son "Jack". Tremblay had what I believe to be the best performance by a child actor/actress in cinema history. I know it's hard to make such a claim, but I was that taken aback by Tremblay's performance. I don't care whether or not Tremblay is nominated as a lead or supporting actor (even though he was a lead in my opinion I know the academy often puts child actors as supporting nominations regardless of their role) as long as he is recognized for his incredible work. I truly felt emotionally invested in these two characters. I genuinely cared for these characters and felt helpless alongside them trapped in "Room". In the scene where Jack is in the back of Old Nick's pickup truck I nearly yelled at the screen. I usually don't show such strong and outward emotions in real life let alone when watching a movie. Emma Donoghue's story is incredible as is Lenny Abrahamson's directing. I feel the need to single out the amazing job done by cinematographer Danny Cohen, especially in the scenes when Jack first sees the world outside of "Room". I felt like I was truly seeing the world through Jack's eyes. Everything looked so vast and bright even though all I was seeing was a simple neighborhood. I may need to give myself more time to digest this film (and perhaps and other viewing), but I think I have to already say this is one of the best films I have ever seen. It could even be in my top 10 films ever, although, like I said, I may just being saying this because the film is so fresh in my memory. While Star Wars: The Force Awakens is still my favorite movie of 2015, Room edges out both Star Wars and Spotlight for my choice of best film of 2015. I will be rooting for Room throughout awards season and hope to see it win the Oscar for Best Picture.Ultimately unsatisfying I have been waiting to see this movie for months. I read the book one holiday and found it gripping and haunting. Sadly, the film did not achieve the level of drama that the novel had in abundance. My husband (who has not read the book and knew nothing of the story) was in agreement. So many missed opportunities to look into the minds and emotions of these characters. The acting was fine but far too much of what made the book so fascinating was skimmed over and I'm not sure why..... I was particularly disappointed by the characterisation of 'Old Nick' (mid-cast, I feel, and we see little of his confused and confusing state of mind. Jack's relationship with the objects in the house is skimmed over and the conflicts of the grandparents were simply alluded to rather than properly explored. Perhaps this oversimplification of a complex and gripping story was an attempt to convey what was happening through Jack's eyes? If so, it didn't work for me.The dark enlightenment. We all have our 'room' and most of us witness that turn in our lives, where we come out of the 'room' created by our society and start questioning the truths, whether it is Political or religious beliefs. This is a perfect flick to explain the lives from a third eye in an over simplified manner and it will leave you awestruck and enlightened. It was a beautifully made movie with great cinematography with outstanding performances by little Jacob and Brie, Though the plot was not that logical and had many holes in the storyline if you see from reality perspective but still a must watch for every generation with deeper lessons about life.Favorite Movie Room is one of my favorite movies. It's very simple but it means so much to me - every time I see it I notice different things. There's a lot of reasons why the story goes as it goes. It's really hard to write a review without containing spoilers so I just want to say that it's very powerful and it's worth it 100%. The performance of the actors are so precious and it's worth it so much to see how they work together.Contagious claustrophobic powerlessness! Holy SH#¬Ä%"! I had to write my first review after watching this movie! This is the most horrible claustrophobic story portrayed in a most amazingly calm and beautiful way. I saw this movie without knowing what I went in to, and was amazed and torn up at the same time. The story unfolds perfectly and every detail was explained to just the right amount, making it horrifyingly realistic and plausible. A movie has never lingered in my head for so many days after watching it, almost adopting the eerie claustrophobic powerlessness of the situation. I just want to do anything else than stay in my room/apartment! Watch it and weep - like I did...overwhelming although what Ma and Jack are suffering is not a thing that likely happen to you or any one you know but this film makes you feel related to them and it leaves you emotionally drained. the moment jack returns to his ma you feel relived, and jack explanation to his surroundings gets you to feel absurd. when Ma was having the interview and doubt got to her about what she did for jack was the right thing it gets to you either. this was the first film i watch made by Lenny Abraham son but now i am sure there will be a lot to come Brie Larson performance was so neat and made me forget she was acting and i believe she is the closest to the academy award this yearUnlimited wisdom with limited room Room, directed by Lenny Abrahamson, is a magical film about the big world inside a small room and the big world which proves to be a small room, as a mother and son escapes into the real world after years of being locked up in a room. As the film begins, we meet Joy Newsmen (Brie Larson) and her 5-year old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who are locked up inside a small room by their captor Nick (Sean Bridgers). Enraged by Jack's perception of the outside world, Joy devises a plan to get them out, which succeeds. The rest of the film deals with them trying to adjust with the world, painting a thoughtful irony on how the bigger world is also a tiny room, but also teaching us the luxury of life that we have, which often goes unappreciated. The film explores and depth-fully portrays the connection between a mother and child, making us feel connected with our own mothers and children. The characters are portrayed so realistically, will all the actors doing an unbelievable job that we find ourselves wondering if they are real, just as Jack wonders what is real and what is not. Although the film's genre is Drama, Abrahamsson has presented the film in such a way that it offers zero-drama, which at times goes to the extent that it seems so real, as if it was a recording of a real life event. Emma Donoghue's writing seems to be based on a true story, and the fact that is not can be only be explained as "magical". Well balanced with scenes that will make you cry and scenes that will make you cheerfully delighted, and the morals that it offers, Room is a must-watch masterpiece, that is deep, lively, and thoughtful, and will undoubtedly room you in its infinite wisdom with only a few characters and limited space.nice movie its a nice movie. shows the love between the mother and her son. the trust between. the social satire of how victims are sometimes just a media thing. it shows how some decisions changes one life. hats off to the child actor who did a wonderful job. one can feel how much terrified he was when being asked by her mother to play dead. the movie also make us learn how to grab happiness from the smallest source possible. almost half of the part shot in the room. enjoy the movie. i suggest watch it with your family. when the movie starts its very tough to guess about the next scene as initially the story revolves around how the mother do not want her child to get out. its later when the father cameo first we get to know she was been held as a hostage. the son wants a birthday cake but don't get what he fancy. anyhow its the mother who decides to break the chain. the innocence of child is seen when one can see how he panic when he is told what happens on t.v. is a real world out there. they plan and eventually get out of that room but only to get trapped in another one. this time a bigger one.Such an emotional film I have never seen such an emotional film with so much sense, feeling and so on. I would recommend it for all the people who just want to watch an extremely good drama. The kid's acting is amazing with that age. He is acting like a real actor: he cries, he laughs, he feels, he can feel everything and maybe this makes this movie so amazing. The first hour is really exciting as well and the other part of the film is just simply beautiful. Everything is happening in the good direction and they needed to be happy after they escaped but it is much more difficult because they have to start the life from the beginning. Especially the Jack has to be known with everything in this real world. He has to know people, pets, plants, seas.."Non stopping heartbeat with a little sobbing" is the summary of that experience. this is a story when the extreme turns to normal, when all hope is lost and the only option is to cope with the horrors of life, and how one can suffer dealing with the normal again when the Weights are lifted off the shoulders. this is how good a mature story can get when told by a five-year old boy, with a five-year old perspective, sad, tragic, deeply emotional and very very profound. but to think this story is the real life of someone real about whom we know nothing, gives you a feeling of depression and sorrow that you would't shake off very easily.Simply remarkable Some moments in film will always stick with you. Some of them are more bombastic like when Rocky made it to the top of the steps or when ET and Elliot fly past the moon on the bike. Room is a more subtle film and its many moments are more personal but no less memorable. No film has ever pulled such an emotional and physical response from me. Like the graveyard scene in Saving Private Ryan or the end of Toy Story 3, the more you see it the harder it hits you but this film extends that feeling for two hours. Much praise has been given to Brie Larson's career defining performance as Ma and she has deserved every award she's won and if there are any she lost she should've gotten them to. She becomes a mother as a teenager, so unprepared, yet she is everything you want in one. Jack is her everything, gives her life meaning that it previously did not have. It's a subtle performance but one of the most powerful, certainly of recent memory. Consider a scene where a reporter asks if she will ever tell Jack about his father. Her response is flawless. The words tell so much but her face... If you watch this scene with the sound of you may not understand what is happening but you will feel everything you are supposed to feel. What stuns me is how little hardware given to Jacob Tremblay. No child actor in the history of cinema has given a performance half as good as his and like all works of artistic brilliance, I struggle to understand why he is so effecting. Maybe its because he is far too young to understand the weight of what is going on. I think its his eyes, his entire face seems too big for his head, very emotive. Whatever it is, he has me wrapped around his little finger. When he is smiling, I'm tearing up with joy, when he is scared I am sobbing in fear (I've seen this three times and I'm practically dehydrated every time) That is not to say that this film is as easily digestible as ET or Rocky. As its plot would dimply, this film is often dark and it is often disturbing. But this is not the horror film that it so easily could have been (though there is a sequence in the middle that is so intense, i want to call it heart pounding but i can't, my heart stopped cold) in fact this is the most uplifting film since Shawshank. For the payoff to have any emotional impact, you have to put the characters through hell. Ultimately this is a film about survival. Jack survived because he is a child and that is what children do, they adapt. Ma survives too, not because of some inner strength but because of Jack. Watch this film and give your mom a hugRoom Of all the films coming out last year, I would definitely have to say that Room was one of my most anticipated releases and one of the films I was most looking forward to. Having now seen the film, I must say that it did not disappoint. I was mentioning in my review for Brooklyn about how we are getting a lot of really good female driven films that have great female performances and great perspectives from a woman's point of view and I would certainly add Room to that list as well. Room, is not based upon a true story, but the events in the film were most likely taken out of the newspaper headlines because we have had a lot of these cases surface and come to light within the past couple of years. The film does an excellent job of conveying what being trapped in a small space would have been like and while the film is quite disturbing at times and leaves you with an unsettled feeling it is also emotionally very powerful and also has moments of great beauty and humanity thrown into the film giving it a wonderful balance of both tragedy, loss and despair as well as hope and love and knowing that with time that everything will turn out okay. The two lead performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are amazing and two of the best performances of this past year, or really any year lately. Larson has proved what a talented actress she is with films like Short Term 12 and now Room will definitely be the film she will receive a much deserved Oscar for. I was really in disbelief though that Jacob Tremblay did not receive an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Jack. Here is a young kid who delivered one of the best child performances I think I have ever seen in a film and he proved himself totally capable of handling and delivering a performance in what is an emotionally really intense film and one that I think even people more than half, or triple his age would find difficulty in doing, but he makes his performance so natural and believable and we believe every second what he is thinking and going through and with his total fascination with the world and the things around him. This was a great oversight for the Academy by not nominating him because it was certainly one of the top performances of last year and worthy of an award. I am so glad that Brie Larson was nominated though and her performance is so great that I know she will be walking away with Oscar gold. Here is a character who goes through the unthinkable and yet while she still struggles during and after her circumstances, we see what a brave and independent woman this is and how for all the years in captivity she put her young son, Jack and his needs in front of her own and always looking after his best was just amazing and completely heart warming to watch. As others have said this film truly captures the deep and personal relationship between a mother and son and the endless love that goes with it. Larson's character is loving and caring for Jack, but we also see how she is strong and even later in the film while dealing with depression and trauma for what she went through we are completely with her every step of the way and again this is such a beautifully natural and realistic performance and one that must have been extremely emotionally draining and challenging to play each and every day, but Larson pulls it off flawlessly and is totally deserving of what is sure to be her first of many Oscars. The film would unfortunately maybe be too difficult for some to watch because of the heavy emotional content and the subject matter of the film, but I would challenge any serious film goers to give the film a chance anyways because it is such a wonderful cinematic experience and one that will surely move you and challenge you in many ways. Often throughout the film as I mentioned earlier, there is also scenes of love, family and maybe even in a sense coming to terms with yourself and the events of your life and these such moments did bring tears to my eyes and deeply moved me. This is a film where we certainly see that there are a lot of bad people in the world who do terrible things to one another, but the film does not let us lose hope because we are also confronted and experience the love between this mother and son and a relationship that does get challenged, but never broken and the strength that family and the right people in your life can have. This is not a film about despair, or the evils of mankind and yet while it does deal with that, this is overall a film about hope and overcoming your past and struggles and finding your peace in life even after a terrible trauma which is further helped by your loved ones. The film is certainly realistic and gritty at times, but all the more natural and real because of it and this is one of the most emotional and best cinematic experiences I have had of last year because we identify with these characters every step of the way and we feel hope and compassion for them and in many ways see that the outside world and things in it are truly beautiful and a wonder to behold and that personal growth and healing can happen to us all no matter what our circumstances.perfect To start this off right I must say that Room (2015) is an amazingly well done film! At first when I saw the trailer for Room I was unsure if I'd want to watch it, not that it didn't seem good; I was wondering if it were gonna be one of those very slow drawn out films as Hollywood seems to push out; this wasn't one of those. In Room 2015 they displayed perfect acting, a beautiful, yet thrilling story; the concept of this film was on point in all ways. Room is one of those films that everyone should check out, the way the team put it all together just couldn't have been any better; perfection to say the least. Room (2015) is a film in which will be in our tops for a very long time.Totally heart-breaking This just... this just... This movie just broke me. When I started watching this, I taught it would be sad and everything, but not THIS kind of sad. I mean, I cried in most part of the film. I cried watching a boy eat cereal, that's how powerful this movie is. With a very hard and deep topic, solid performances and the greatest photographer, screen-writers, directors,etc ever, Room will be one of my all-time-favorite-heart-breaking-movies. You want to cry? Just give this movie like, ten minutes, ant then we talk. Another great thing about Room is that, yeah, it's heart-breaking, it deals with a pretty taboo topic and is very real; but at the same tame is fast-passing and its so easy to connect with the characters... And I just love the hopeful message at the end. This movie was simply too much for me.MeLnly This movie reminded me of a long period of my life ,,, " no one is strong alone , we all help each other to stay strong " ... feeling lonely is really awful so please don't be alone even if you thought you could be stronger by Yourself ! Unfortunately I know  this feeling well , I thought it's better to distance myself from people  and even my family when I'm sad but it just made me worse !!! And I wish I could stop feeling alone all the time! So don't you ever choose to be alone !What a wonderful film Wow, this is such an incredible film. The acting is simply flawless and Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are sensational in their roles. Lenny Abrahamson's direction is great, the shots are excellent, the pace is spot on and the film's score is rousing and beautiful. The film's story, which I really don't want to spoil, is brilliant - it's so well thought through and so tight, nothing falls through the cracks, no scenes or lines are unnecessary or useless, the film has no wasted material. Emma Donoghue's screenplay is excellent; sad, uplifting, tragic and wondrous, the film captures all of these feelings and emotions and Donoghue's script aids this immensely. Please go out and see this film, it really deserves all the credit and money it can get. One of the best, if not THE best, films of the year.Wonderful !!! This movie, is one of my best ever! Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are awesome ! Just perfect !!! Go ahead, you will not regret it !! "Room" by being inspired by real facts this dirty Austrian affair of which in particular, already had enough to call out(to question) us. One has to note that Lenny Abrahamson was more than as high as this difficult stake and One has to note that both main actors Brie(Brie cheese) Larson and Jacob Tremblay who embody Joy and Jack are fabulous and give without concession all that they have to offer! This intelligent movie never overturns into the pathos, but takes place as study and analysis of this horrible confinement of 7 years..."Room" is one must witness on the nearest screen possible. If there is one life changer of a movie, "Room" is one must witness on the nearest screen possible to experience a heart-stirring tale of mother and son. Though as simple as the premise is of a mother and son taken captivity, what makes "Room" stand out is how it can take the gut right out of every emotion to convey the complexities of the source material by Emma Donoghue (who also wrote the screenplay) with the the help of Lenny Abrahamson's subtle direction. Brie Larson is at her best ever, since "Short Term 12", playing the scorned Ma, having to make ultimate sacrifices for her son Jack, played by the excellent Jacob Tremblay. It is their performances what made "Room" hit all the heartfelt notes in an unforgettable way. Every individual and duel moment from them will take your breath away. From the claustrophobic scenes in "room" to the breathtaking touches of "space", the experience is one of a kind.It's Room, It's Home Watching "Room" is an intense experience for it's the story of a woman (ma) who fights for the survival of her child, the one source of happiness and strength in a very limited world, a place that could have killed her long ago.  At first, we see the interaction between mother and Jack. Through the eyes of a very gifted director, we are able to almost feel their hearts beating, how their souls are almost like one. He depends on her completely because it's all he has known. She has insulated him from pain and created a world inside their prison. He's happy, and that sustains her. It's what makes her endure the visits of her kidnapper. She has become one with the child, but one day she realizes he will grow up, and this place will not be sufficient for either, especially for him. Jack is a bright and inquisitive young boy. He has learned to read, and he is beginning to wonder. She knows it won't take long for his soul to break because he's like her, a part of her: a sensitive soul that needs to grow and develop. There's much love here, but there's plenty of sadness and horror, too. One day, she fashions a plan to secure his freedom, and at first, it's not good enough, but with a modification, it succeeds, and this is barely the first half of the film because unlike other stories and film makers who take the easy road and simplify the dilemma or the problems of the main characters, this film has taken us to the edge of the precipice, and if you thought the life in the room was hell, things are about to really intensify. Transitioning into normalcy is not as simple as it's in the fairy tales, and just like Larson and Tremblay have already proved themselves as accomplished actors, their performances become even more exquisite in the second half of the story. We got to know them as they spoke about the world. We knew how simple their existence was, how controlled, and how dangerous it was, too. We became part of their world, and now as the doors of freedom are open, we begin a long road to adjustment. It is not easy. It might have more pain than we realized. Most people are happy to see Ma (Joy), but Jack represents many things to others. For those with a big heart, he's a bright and scared little boy who will most likely be o.k. after a while. It's the immediate family who have the toughest time since the transition is sudden and very emotional. Joy's mother tries the hardest, and it's a good thing she's around. Others experience a myriad of feelings which will affect both Jack and his mother. Her prison has changed her, and her expectations don't quite match her perceptions.  It's at this moment that I was so impressed by Tremball's performance, which is better than most of this year's praised performances, adult or otherwise. He communicates his emotions through body gestures, glances, strong lonely yearning with his eyes, as he goes through the new trauma the big world has for him. It's a long and painful road, but it has a good resolution, one that feels real and universal, one that doesn't rely in long speeches, beautiful photography or any sort of overblown productions. This is as heartfelt as they come, giving us another reason to believe that we haven't forgotten to be human.The best drama of 2016 I had just recently watched The Revenant in the movie theater and I though that it was the best I had seen this year and by far during last year as well, but I watched Room, and now I am thinking to myself - how can everything be so perfect about the movie, perfect to the point where tears are streaming down my face all because this film was too special and too irresistible not to cry about it. This is a must watch for anyone who loves movies, stories and splendid acting. Brie Larson and Mr.Jacob - you guys were unbelievable, so natural, so emotional, I fell in love with both of you and can never get you out of my heart, you reached that very core and I can never take out your characters out and I do not want to! This movie was something out of this world. Nothing else I can say. SPEECHLESS.Horrible Couldn't get past the first 40 min of depressing material. This is just too much for me. Why is the story of a captive and her child interesting? It is not. Shows the detailed life of a captive person. I am sure there is something uplifting at some point but I am just not interested. This is current, has happened, etc. I just don't need to watch the detail of it including the emotional pain etc. This is not a story that needs to be told it is a story that we need to prevent in the real world. It is not entertaining, just exceptionally depressing. The possibility of harm to the child by the captor is in no way exciting or interesting to me. I could also watch a day in the life of a prisoner who is raped in the cell but why? Is that somehow interesting? Not to me.Bored to Hell Sometimes there are these special movies - high ratings, lots of ppl loving them and you just wonder - is this the same movie Iam watching ppl are talking about!? I was just well bored, almost bored to a brain-killing stupor. The young kid played his role not bad but if I compare him with the little girl from the movie Hidden (I know, I know, different genres but at least the location/space/set for acting is comparable)- he's just okay. The one thing I was the whole time wondering - why the woman didn't just kill the guy in his sleep. Well I heard about Stockholm-Syndrome, but the woman didn't behave imo like a person with that "kind of state" would, but Iam no specialist here. Well, so many ppl praising and liking that movie so tbh they can't be all wrong - so just try that movie and see what kind of movie Room is for you. Btw - one very weak point of the movie is for me that I didn't attach to the mother and his son at all - I watched that movie with no sympathy nor dislike for them. Well, I rated it 1 because of all the legions of 10s, my "real" vote is a 4 but no more. I re-watched the movie and I must say I even do like it less, if it's possible. I realised why I don't like this movie at all: Room tells us the typical Love-Conquers-It-All-Narration but if u have ever known/met a person or worked with a person who was sexually or otherwise traumatically assaulted you know that just love doesn't heal everything. Lots of ppl just never really leave behind the trauma, the trauma is a big part of their life. So this movie is kinda Disney-life and has not much to do with real life. Room is the typical sugar-coated version (and the book also if it has the same conclusion) of a Love-Conquers-It-All-script - it happens in real life yes, but this kind of story is told countless times before on screen and in real life rare. Many real good stories hurt reading, but Hollywood gives you 9 times out of 10 cotton-candy at the end. So does Room. Btw - the boy almost shows no sign of disturbance in his behavior whatsoever. If u see pictures (or meet them in real life) of e.g. war-traumatized kids you understand how dumb this is. If I compare this movie to The Lovely Bones with Saoirse Ronan, Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz u also see that the actors are just mediocre. And whereas The Lovely Bones is really heartbreaking and got suspense and is told poetically superb, Room has nothing of it to offer. Or watch Chained with Vincent D'Onofrio as a sick, emotionally dead serial killer. To watch D'Onofrio's superb play was shocking good. And the relationship between Rabbit (Eamon Farren) and his captor Bob (D'Onofrio) beats everything Room provides easy. Chained is shocking good. Room is shocking naive and boring.It doesn't get any worse It opens badly, but this is deceptive. If you watch carefully, are very, very patient, look at what's actually there, and give it three minutes-----it gets worse. But wait. This too is unfair. Are you actually seeing what's in front of your eyes? Are you sure? The film demands that you give it at least another ten minutes, and you do. And as soon as you do, it gets worse. After that it gets worse, and then worse, and worse, and worse. And it's only just begun. The setting hasn't even left the room. Then it does. Finally. Surprise! A goodly portion of the film, in fact, at least 30 percent, takes place outside the room. I have no idea why. To show that the outside world is just as claustrophobic? That would've been a good point, but the story doesn't allow it! The writer is adrift. The shift of scenery doesn't help. It makes Room even worse - and it gets worse yet, and even worse than that, despite the brief, welcome, charitable appearance of two superbly talented actors (William H. Macy and Joan Allen) who can actually act, whether they have a character to play or not. Acting, in fact, is not an issue in the movie. To be fair, the child star of the film, Jacob Tremblay (made deliberately genderless as only a 5-year-old could be) gives as execrable a performance as any adult ever has, and deserves a lot of credit for it. If the director intended it that way, he probably either has no children, or doesn't know or like any. It's not totally Tremblay's fault: he obviously found it impossible to believe in the story, as did the writer, director, actors and producers who concocted this infinitely boring, one-dimensional, unfelt drama. Here and there throughout the story, that sickly, treacly piano that has invaded the soundtrack of hundreds of anemic films like a skin rash makes an appearance. To top it off, Room is made with the highest of production values. They are the only values visible, and may lift the movie to the heights of Trumpian emptiness. Americans love nothing better in their movies: production values are the new family values. The overall impression is of a movie, clunkily directed by Lenny Abrahamson, written by someone (Emma Donoghue) whose entire experience of life must have been acquired in a room, probably a classroom, possibly a cloakroom, a writer unashamed to display her bad handwriting, and constitutionally unable or unwilling to share with the public how little she knows or cares about the world she inhabits. A lot has been written about the hell the cinematographers went through to make parts of this movie, jamming their equipment into a tiny cramped space for countless hours. It doesn't show, and what does is not interesting. If they'd shown us the hell, and not the Room they made of it, I'd have had a lot less to say but would've left with more than a craving for a quick burger on my mind.Ugliest film This is the Ugliest film i have ever seen, the idea is good but there is a lot of weakness in the script and in directing. The boy is a clown or what? We all thought he was a girl? What are you trying to do? Does a boy really watch dora? Is it so difficult to cut his hair a little bit? All you want to do is showing us how a boy can become GAY ? Or you want him to be gay? It is really sad and the sadest thing is that people adore such movies , 8,6 for this movie? Is this movie better than schindler's list? Better than Titanic? And The pianist? And many others uplifting movies? You should open your eyes people, your ears and do not accept everything the garbage gives you.Not a kind of film you should "want" to watch. Room - A gross irresponsibility of the writer of this film, along with a supporting production crew, and cast. The story glamorizes the process of being held hostage, using a young women and her child. I am afraid why a story teller would choose such a topic, and why would he be so consumed as to make a message of this to the general population. Although it may seem cute at first seeing how a boy senses the room, and world around him; I am left with the taste that it only desensitizes others. This is not a story we should expose ourselves to like this, as a human race we might be tempted to play it down if it happens to others in real life, or make it seem to others it is not so bad to commit such an act to others. There is a responsibility here when you interact with the public. I realize art is based on trying to work through what happens to you or what you have experienced, the art part being you are trying to get others to feel and communicate with you and what you are experiencing. But if that be the case here, then a more appropriate form of art in the direction of it should have been a movie portraying the horror of being held captive, and better yet maybe even realize this is too hard a topic not just for the writer to articulate but also too hard for the general public to consume.  I give this film a rating of zero, and suggest this film maker and crew take a different occupation to make money. I don't want to be a part of any of it anymore. And yes, there are many movies which could be labeled as I did with this one, but someone should write an honest review, a responsible review.
Way better than the critics want you to believe I thoroughly enjoyed Chappie. I usually don't write reviews, but after seeing the brutal rating this movie is getting I felt compelled to write this review. Chappie is a funny, entertaining, and surprisingly sentimental movie about a sentient robot being raised by gangsters in Johannesburg. Most of the criticisms I've seen about one- dimensional characters and illogical character choices are valid, but Chappie's character, the CGI, the humor, and the overall aesthetic of the movie more than make up for these shortcomings. Please go see this movie and make up your own mind. I almost didn't go last night because of the negative reviews, but I'm so happy I did. I'm very excited to see this movie again. You leave this movie feeling like you've become friends with Chappie, and I hope the bad reviews don't prevent the sequels from being made. If you like Neill Blomkamp's directing and style you will love this movie.Why the hate? Why all the hate for this movie? I understand not liking something, but everyone seems to just TRASH it. Did I see the same movie? I saw an emotional film about innocence and loss. I REALLY don't understand. Sure, maybe the film didn't have the best dialogue or the best acting in the world, but it hit home for me. The VFX were phenomenal, Chappie is the best CGI motion capture I have seen in a long time, the 100% electronic musical score by Hans Zimmer was really unique and fresh, and it has a really great ending. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. If you like Blomkamp's previous films or are remotely interested, please watch it yourself. I think the critics are wrong on this one. I have been thinking for a while about why the reviews are so out there. First off, the trailers are AWFUL. The first to come out was this philosophical "What does it mean to be human?" kinda movie. The TV trailers were "GUNS, EXPLOSIONS, ROBOTS!!!" and it is neither. Think "Little Miss Sunshine" with a robot, that is a more accurate representation. Blomkamp's most underrated film.Don't let critics reviews put you off. Don't let the critics who can't seem to get past comparing Chappie with other sci-fi titles put you off of going to see this film.  This story is about a lot more than just robot police officers it is a thought provoking social commentary on many modern day issues and what it is like to bring life into the modern world. I very much enjoyed District 9 but I would even go as far to say I enjoyed Chappie much, much more. There were so many aspects to this film that could have went wrong but have been nailed on the head by the director. The effect once again visually striking and a very well paced and intricate development of characters as well as interesting set design helps keep chappie fresh and not just another reboot of any other sci fi film as critics will have you believe. I would also say I enjoyed this film much, much more than the likes of robo-cop.Mixed thoughts on this one: Much more intelligent than the average flick, but not really good Chappie is an interesting film because it could be ridiculed for random themes and inconsistent story, or it could be praised for the fact that it brings up a lot of ambitious ideas and concepts. It is a really interesting film as far as themes go. The movie brings up a lot of ideas that aren't brought up in most "AI" films such as: Does the robot recognize his own mortality? Does the robot feel guilt? How does the robot react to having one parent being a criminal and the other parent being a respectful scientist? There were a lot of scenes where I was thinking "Dang, this could lead to a pretty cool concept".  Unfortunately, the movie never fleshes out any of its themes. It is always very sad to see a movie like this: A movie that has all the right elements to be good, but it gets too distracted in being too many things so it never gets any of the elements right. For example, one of the ingenious themes is the fact that Chappie has two parents: A scientist and a very violent thug. On one side Chappie is learning about the basics of language and how to be a model citizen, but on the other side he is learning how to properly mug people, how to fight, how to talk cool, how to walk cool, and how to earn respect from other people. This is very interesting because the movie never starts Chappie out as super intelligent, it starts him out as a very quick learning child. This means you can see him slowly learn and make connections between every event in his life. A great example of this is Chappie is told that knives make people go to sleep, so naturally Chappie tries to stab people until he is told that they don't want to go to sleep. However, when Chappie starts stabbing people later, you see him pause and looks into someone's eyes and say "I'm sorry, I didn't know. Don't go to sleep". But he says it very quietly so that no one else can hear. These are some very deep and interesting themes and Chappie is a very interesting character. Unfortunately, it never fleshes out its themes. This means a lot of very profound themes will fly by in about five minutes and not show up later. This also brings us to one hilarious big issue with the movie: Every scene involving the villain makes little to no sense. It's not that I don't mind Hugh Jackman, or the approach they were taking, it was how insane and over the top he becomes. He is supposed to be playing a local engineer/scientist who wants to make human controlled mechs that are grossly over-powered for the job of law enforcement. Instead of modifying his idea and making it work for the job, he still says that law-enforcement needs a mech with... mini-guns, claws, machine guns, rockets, cluster missiles, and just about anything you can think of. It really makes no sense to want that on the street. This brings up several questions: Why not just sell it to the military? He does work for a weapons company so if not law enforcement why not military (He was hinted at being an ex- solider/Veteran). So his obsession doesn't really make sense: If he really wants human controlled machines, then make one less overpowered. If he really wants an overpowered mech, then sell it to the military. However, because he doesn't do either of these, he becomes an insane psychopath who literally shuts down all of the security/robots in the city just to prove that they need heavier firepower for the job. This brings up a lot of plot-holes: How was he able to do this so easily? Any company (even your local cable company) can track a computer that is shutting down other equipment. How did no one notice him doing this? Why didn't the protagonist tell anyone else that he was doing this? How was he able to gruesomely kill fairly innocent people, while laughing, and no one in the office space took notice? This element of the movie truly absurd and doesn't even fit into the plot. He really is a shoe-horned villain. Just about anyone else could've been the villain and it would've made more sense. Why not the ring-leader from the beginning? He said he wanted to shut- down all of the robots? Several other people were looking for a remote to shutdown all of the robots, so literally anyone could've been the villain and would've had better motives than Hugh Jackman. Other than that, the ending is a bit random, but I was okay with it until the last minute or so. The very very end is kind of... okay? That doesn't make sense with the universe's set rules, but... okay... Fortunately, the other characters in this movie are pretty good. Some people may find them annoying, but I found it interesting because its not like Chappie fell into the hands of perfect people who knew how to use him, Chappie fell into the hands of people who have no idea how robots work or the science behind them. So certain people attach to him differently. Some people treat him like a human, while others do not. All in all, a smarter than your average film, but full of plot-holes and issues. Kind of sad, really.Simply put - it is beautifully stupid I believe this movie only solidifies my concrete statement that 21st century is an age of pointless cinema.  Most of the plot in Chappie either fails to follow common human logic, or completely breaks it. This is a modern trend of over- dramatizing the events by making "shit happen" in the literal meaning of this phrase. It all starts in a not-too distant future with an international corporation, based in SAR, which solved the problem of rising crime wave by introducing almost all-robotic police force. Then few things just happen:  The lead researcher makes a breakthrough in AI development and asks company CEO to give him a broken robot for experiments. She "politely" refuses and desperate doc risks his impressive paycheck and reputation by stealing this piece of junk off the scrapyard.   The rival former-military engineer fails to sell his combat machine (which for some reason looks like robot-chicken from robocop) and after another budget cut risks his not-so-impressive paycheck, but more solid reputation as pioneer in neural interfaces, to sabotage the whole "scout" operation and start a nationwide crime spree   A local gang with looks of early 90s inspired cyberpunk movies get into conflict situation with another dude. In order to solve this problem they need to find 20.000.000 moneys, so the only logical solution is to find a robot-maker and get a hypothetical OFF-switch, so it will be easier to do whatever crimes they've planned with their pumpkin heads.  They bust the doctor, while he was driving a van with a stolen robot. After successful installation of new software they get a semi-intelligent gansta-ninja robot filled with curiosity, deep understanding of neural interfaces and human consciousness, but lacking the basic knowledge of trauma, pain and death (even with internet connection). The end result: all robots are broken, everyone is dead. After lots of shooting and the final boss battle Chappie revives the doctor and his mama as robots. Credits start rolling, so are my strained eyes... Gave it 3/10 for visuals. Everything else sucks. All the aspects of the movie that fans claim to be unique and innovative have been meticulously copied from many other(even recent) sci-fi titles with no sign of shame or remorse.Great visuals, completely ludicrous plot Felt like leaving the theater for this one. It started off nicely, with a hugely successful robot task force with moderate A.I. Then for some reason funding gets cut and the head developer decides to go rogue and install his untested super A.I. on a stolen robot. Hard to swallow plot #1: The robots can only be reprogrammed in the presence of a unique key USB disk. The developer just picks it up and takes it home, spends several days with it, and no one bats an eye. #2: Chappie is born with the knowledge of a baby. But miraculously he learns the English language in a couple of days of exchanging a few sentences with his "parents". #3: The bad guys let the developer, which they just stole and beat the crap of, come and go as he pleases. No worries of him alerting the authorities or his companies' own robot army. Which he doesn't, inexplicably. #4: For someone so intelligent, Chappie is pretty dumb. He knows shooting someone kills them but is convinced that knifing "just makes them sleep". #5: After lying to manipulate the robot every step of the way, the "bad daddy" decides to come clean and admit that in fact he can't prevent Chappie's demise. Which obviously results in almost getting killed. #6: The same "bad daddy" then does a complete flip flop and puts his life on the line to save Chappie. Which is going to die in a few hours anyway. And not in any effective way I might add, he just decides to become a sitting duck for some reason. #7: The factory where all the mayhem originated from is the least secure place in the city. And absolutely no one, except for the protagonist and the antagonist, are able to go to the command console and sort things out. In fact it just remains abandoned in all other times. #8: The childlike robot prodigy miraculously (again) is able to do a feat no else had: transfer consciousness. With some banged up laptop too. #9: Police is nowhere to be seen, and despite being perfectly possible to restore the malfunctioning robots from the control central no one decides to even try it. There's just frantic panic and cowboy stunts. There's more but you get the picture. To me the movie was painful to watch. Every character seemed to be shouting all the time and have complete disregard for logic. It was a dumb movie. The one nice thing that temporarily took the pain away was the warm feeling you get when you realize the robot is able to sacrifice his own life for the survival of a human. So, 2 minutes out of 120. Maybe I should have rated this even lower - but the 3/10 stands, because of visuals.Shame on Metacritic and others This is not just an excellent and entertaining movie, i found many elements as real/istic and present, it is just touched some (maybe) future elements. Neil pulled the maximum out of this story and made it unforgettable as District 9 was. How ever, my stomach turns upside down when i see the Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes score, these pathetic sites and their brainless people (called themselves "critics") live amongst us with their nonsense and empty headed, braintumored criticism - sure, this movie has no Beverly Hills and it's "amazing" crowd, no lemonade punch as story, no muscle cars and no muscle people, no worldwide threat to the USA and such. It has something else to say and this is the core of this amazing movie. Afterall, Chappie has Everything that needs for a unique and must-see movie, sure, it is a target for all those (disgusting) critics who expect the everyday boring lemonade with everyday boring actors and actress. Shame on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, you guys are not more, than just rotten and brainless second level scribblers.District 9 meets Dumb and Dumber There seems to be vast polarization amongst film viewers on this one. I went to the theater with an open mind despite seeing reviews from both camps. After viewing the movie to the end, I walked out somewhat baffled by what I'd watched.  The first impression, ten minutes in, was that the dialog was written by a twelve year old child, maybe ten. Characterizations likewise seemed so utterly juvenile. Fine. Whatever. So it's a kids movie? Right? Wrong! Blood and guts, adult themes, and really immature gangsters portrayed as somehow likable. Horrible script!  What is this? Disney gone wrong? There was such a discordant note running through this mess. Are film-makers really so desperate for revenue that they stoop to lowly marketing ploys? Are adults dumbed down to the extent of enjoying such ploys? I'm thinking it's decrepit marketing. "Let's just bandwidth the audience to the lowest common denominator,"said the executive producers.  Terri is a much better writer than this...this...train-wreck deserves. District 9 had an adult theme and appropriate dialog. This film did not meet both criteria. Now I understand the critical reviews stating this film as a failure in execution. Insulting to adults, detrimental to kids.  Shame on you Neill Blomkamp. You let us down in many ways. Minus many stars for wasting, insulting exceptional talent. 4/10 only for amazing production values and CGI. Everything else is garbage, including the choice to have Chappie's AI "learn" in a totally absurd manner. That's all.Funny, Violent, Heart-warming, Heart-wrenching, Thought-provoking story I went into Chappie as a huge fan of the gritty action and social commentary of District 9. I expected that this would be more of the same. Both are still present, but surprisingly, with laughs. This is one of the more entertaining movies from every angle that I've seen in awhile. I described it as I left as funny, sad, uplifting, dark, light, silly, and tense. The center of the story is Chappie. He is a hero you want to shelter, even though you want him to learn. But even as you love his curiosity, you fear his naivet√©. He is the most complex character, and gives a fascinating paradigm into how children must receive and process human society and contradiction. There are some inconsistencies in Chappie's character (is he already programmed to raise his voice if he's scared, or did he learn that?), but he still succeeds as a dynamic, independent being. Yes, the humans characters are flat. They are merely roles. The Maker. The Villain. Mommy and Daddy. The friend. But as Chappie begins to learn, you see why they have to be flat. They are trying to exert influence on a (robotic) child. Therefore, they must simplify their own motivations and desires into the most basic explanations possible for Chappie to understand. This leads to hilarious imitation and thought-provoking perspectives. Chappie's curiosity was once ours. Chappie's confusion was once ours. Watching Chappie is like watching a sped-up version of childhood social and moral development, with all of the Hollywood tension, explosions, and naughty words to keep you interested, too. There are parts to laugh at because it's funny, parts to laugh at because the costuming and set design is ridiculous, but you still end up thinking seriously the whole time. Give it a chance. You might love it. I did.Crappie I don't usually write reviews on here, but I have to get this off my chest. This is more of a warning than a review. I saw the high rating on IMDb and gave this movie a shot. The trailer looked decent and reminded me of good action scenes in District 9. I wanted to leave while watching the movie so many times. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did... I had my hopes up when the thugs were teaching Chappie how to stab people that he'd stab them, I'd have a laugh, and we'd move on to some other characters and a better movie! But I was let down on that one. The movie doesn't go anywhere. You just hang out with the obnoxious Die Antwoord members the whole time. Others have mentioned the movie being like Short Circuit and Robocop, but the movie even adds a flare of Transcendence towards the end -- Chappie figures out how to transfer consciousness to save his maker, himself and even "mommy." Ninja keeps going on about a heist he wants Chappie to help him with the whole movie. The heist was my ticket price and 2 hours. I felt frustrated and let down after watching this movie. I don't get how other people seem to like it? Must be Die Antwoord fans. I wish I never saw the film.Great movie. Reviewers are way off with this. This is a great movie definitely in the style of Niell Blomkamp. However, some people might consider this a fault, as Elysium was a little off the mark. What is great about the movie is its style. They really went all out with Yolandi and Ninja (the main characters part of the musical group Die Antwoord). Hugh Jackman is pretty hilarious as a bloodthirsty war vet, selling his role pretty well. The technology in this movie is fantastic, as usual coming from Blomkamp, leaving plenty of ideas for the imagination to wonder about for the future. Of course, Chappie really makes this movie; taking something so technical and robotic, making it human in action. He really gets the feels going. I haven't laughed like that in a movie theater in a long time. Add to that the oddness of the characters influencing the development of Chappie, this movie is gangster.  Still, 9/10, super great movie.Raise your hand if you were paid to provide a thumbs up! I had high anticipations for this movie. The trailer could've won a trailer Oscar. After it was over I was so angry that I wished I could terminate everyone involved with this horrible movie. What a waste of time and money. Everybody should be ashamed of their involvement. No plot development, putrid acting performances - hey, Hugh, tone down the roid rage or skip the gym a couple days a week! The villains were laughable, offering wooden recitation of terrible dialog. The plot was so full of logic holes that the focus for me became how anybody would have thought the script was well-written and deserved funding. Somebody - but certainly not the right person - is taking one the hard way for this mess. I'm no Roger Ebert so pardon the lack of cinematic dissertation, but it's not needed. This movie sucks, plain and simple, and the parties responsible should be stripped of their profits and made to watch it repeatedly for a month. It IS that bad. This guy nailed it better than I did so I'm going to give him a shout out - Jeremy Jobe, USA - and try this: "I have no words for how bad it was. I was thinking of crafting a heated letter to Hugh Jackman and demanding he reimburse me for 2 hours of my life. It was so bad that I used to like District 9, but my consciousness has traveled back in time and now hates it for reminding me of Chappie. It was my personal Vietnam set to film. Terrible plot, combined with every single actor simultaneously putting on the worst acting performances of their respective careers. I just ate some cheesecake to try and take this day down a notch. I don't want to hate the reviewers that posted positive ratings before me, but a small part of me truly does. Why, WHY would you play this cruel joke on your fellow IMDBers? There is no way anyone actually went to this movie and walked out thinking "That was pretty good!" How, how, please God, why are there 10/10 reviews all over this page? When I am 80 years old and on my death bed, I will look back and wonder what I might have been able to do with the 2 hours that I once squandered watching Chappie."A Rare Entertaining AND Technologically Honest SciFi I went to watch it because I like scifi and AI/robot theme TV/movies in general. Some I hate (Her, A.I.) some I love (Blade Runner, Battlestar remake, Wall-E). This one, I love. I didn't have an opinion about Neill Blomkamp. Didn't even know Hugh Jackman is in this movie so it was a pleasant surprise. I was emotionally moved and entertained. Chappie is one of - no, THE MOST action-packed YET emotionally-engaging and HEARTFUL movies I've watched in a while, no bored moments and no time for going into meta-analysis. Can't believe I cared about a clunky metalic wire-ly robot, haven't since the far-cuter Wall-E anyway.  Dev Pattel is well cast, did the role total justice. Sigourney did her part with just the right note. Hugh succeeded in compressing his bigger-than-life self into an unglamorous (even unflattering) thug-in-cubicle-job role. Very noble of him, lending his superstar weight to this project. (showing Mr.BirdMan how a real-life hero gracefully bow out of superhero phase of his film role) In spite of the tension from start to end, people burst out laughing A LOT throughout. There were lots of humor, but nothing contrived, just Grade AAA seamless storytelling. And if the key characters act crazy, it is explained why, without being captain obvious. Dialogs and expositions, 99% SHOW vs tell, Mckee would be proud, not that it mattered against the hateful bigots of pro critics Borg contingent. I decided somewhere along 20 minutes in - I REALLY like this directorial voice.  The technical bits: the story craft, the plotting, pacing, editing, art directing, effects, all superb and SEAMLESSLY EXECUTED. Zero complaint there. My only beef is as usual the theological stuff but I will not trash something this brilliant because it doesn't agree with my spiritual viewpoint.  Side note on IRRELEVANCY OF RT CRITIC SCORE (and probably Academy Self-Awards) I never cared about Rotten Tomatos score but my other half love to check it after every movie. We both anticipated the critics will be hateful with this one because it features a non-American director and 2 non-American male leads! But we didn't expect the shamelessness level. At least the audience disagreed by a HUGE margin, and the audience WORLDWIDE will continue to disagree as the box office telly of Rest of The World come in. This movie is trashed due to PURE POLITICAL reason. DUH. There are some really tightly-wound-up, bitter ANALysts in the mainstream "art" critic scene, who have forgotten how to feel sentient, and lost touch with everything, obviously. Anyway, go watch it, just for entertainment. If you happen to be moved then it is a bonus. It will prove that you have a heart, and more sentient than the average Borgs who's tied into "networked group mind" opinions. Meanwhile I totally look forward to a sequel. 9/10. +1 just to annoy the art-haters.Great FX, but lacks in storyline I liked District 9 and Elysium, so I was really looking forward to Chappie, especially for the special effects that I'd seen in those previous films. I felt like Chappie needed to be at least another hour longer to convey the director's message properly. There are way too many holes in the story to lead to such a thought-provoking ending. I'll say there was sufficient delivery on the special effects, but the story was not extensive enough. One - there's no explanation as to why "Ninja" and his mates owe some master criminal millions of dollars; two - one minute Chappie's being bullied by thugs and the next we're to expect they're loving foster parents; and three - why would transferring one's "consciousness" to another being also carry their voice and accent over? I expect a movie to suspend my beliefs for a couple of hours, but a story that flows well makes for $ better spent.An Excellent Movie with a few rough edges Chappie is exuberant, playful, funny and perhaps one of the most human characters to grace the screen in years. He's an unwilling action hero that one can both identify with and admire. His story is gripping and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately some of Chappie's brilliance comes at the expense of the world around him. Plot holes and logical fallacies abound, and although some of it can be written off to the imperfection of humanity (a central theme in the movie) there are enough "Wait, why the would he/she/they do X."" moments to be a significant distraction. Many reviewers have complained that Chappie Clich√©. In an era where the majority of box office darlings with &gt;8 star reviews are remakes, reboots or result of the Disney/Pixar/Marvel equation the majority of those reviewers are clearly either hypocrites or they don't know what clich√© means. Chappie is soaked in the Blomkamp style and while that style was new and fresh with District 9, its unreasonable to expect a director's primary product to be novelty. Overall it's a good movie, certainly more interesting than most of the box-office-safe fare out that's been out there.Very worth watching... I found the movie highly entertaining and thought-provoking, funny and distressing at the same time. Couldn't help but think about how true this story is: your child associates with the "wrong crowd" and no matter how much you try, what you say, s/he is going down a bad path. All you can hope for is that they'll find their real self before it's too late... I usually don't like violent movies, or films about gangsters, druggies, and such. This has all these components in it - however, it was very clear to me, that I would never, ever want to live in a world as depicted there. (Not like most other movies with these topics, where that attitude towards life is idolized and glorified...) Never mind what the critics say, watch it yourself - what have you got to loose? 2 hours of your life. I think, these 2 hours will be much better spent there, than watching any mainstream TV...One of the worst films I've seen The big problem with this movie is that none of the characters are likable. Chappie's "family" is made up of criminals who raise him to be a "gangsta" / "pimp" complete with bling. I don't know if this was supposed to come off as heartwarming, but it's just stupid and corny as hell. I kept hoping they would die the entire movie. Chappie himself is like an annoying little kid who does stupid things and lacks common sense. The worst part is the accent. I don't know if that's how real South Africans talk, but it just did not fit a robot at all and was really obnoxious to listen to. It was like the movie tried too hard to be cool. Combine all this with a plot that is nonsense. For example: Chappie's maker is like the next Steve Jobs, yet he works in a cubicle in what resembles a run down warehouse. The computers look like they came from the 80's, complete with DOS. Seriously? Did South Africa not get Windows? The gangsters let Chappie's maker go free repeatedly for no apparent reason when he could obviously have gone to the police at any point. Are these the dumbest criminals in the world? These are just a few examples of the idiotic script. Another thing is people keep mentioning how great the director is. I honestly don't care what he directed in the past. This movie sucks.So Bad, it's Bad I do not write reviews, but felt compelled to add my views on this film. From the previous reviews, this appears to be a 'Marmite' film. I'm not going to go into a long diatribe, I just found it preposterous, not because of the concept of the film which is following a current trend in near future Ai/robot story lines, but because of the almost cartoonish acting, and the disjointed implausible plot development from start to finish. I am a Sigourney Weaver fan but I'm afraid this is a turkey for her, and I guess the other main actors will list this film very low down on their CV. Anyone that watches this film should then compare it with another recent Ai film; 'Ex Machina', which I consider to be a far superior movie on all levels.Not a typical Sci-fi, thats what makes it great The trailer of the movie talks about the black sheep, that is being different, So I would say this one was the black sheep in the world of sci-fi movies. The story of a robot, which is being depicted in unbiased manner( not robot-as-a-monster or robot-as-an-angel movie) is quiet refreshing. The robot Chappie not just marvels you but make you emotional at times. So be prepared to get your eyes drenched at times. I think these are some of those moments when you feel this is not a sci-fi or action stereotype, but that is what makes it wonderful. Action cuts are great(very less of them), actor have done wonderful job (especially the lady who acts as Chappies "mommie") Loved it. P.S. Don't do on critic reviews, I have no idea why this movie is bashed so muchThe story failed the new concept of police robot. The scrip is very illogical in the sense that it lacked common sense. I mean, how could Deon not call the police when he had the chance to take Chappie back? Really? A genius could not think of that? Where's the security in Tetravaal? No cameras? How could Deon and Vincent slip away with the key guard? Or whatever they called it. When Deon was shot, why would they not go to the hospital instead of transferring his consciousness? I mean that's where the first place to go. As for my review, there are many gaps and out of the context decisions by characters in the story. Some may argue that this movie is revolutionary in the sense that it goes away with the "mainstream stories" and tackles rather "socio-political issues". But I've seen a lot of movies like that, and they were not mediocre like what Chappie movie shows. The story could have been better. I was expecting more of "what would a human do" on several scenes rather than "how stupid can human be". If the story was about corrupt government and society, well, it failed to show it. Although it showed potential in giving a new taste of robot police concept, the story failed it.Really stupid This movie has so many holes that I cannot even cover them all. I love how movie makers think of Artificial Intelligence as Artificial Feeling. It was really ridiculous that the robot immediately started acting like a child as soon as it had AI. A machine will act like a child only if it's programmed to behave like one. Not just by giving it self awareness. It was also stupid that the movie tried to make heroes out of the stupid vicious criminals. And implanting the consciousness to new body to achieve immortality, this has been used in the movie The 6th day with Arnold Schwartzenegger. Implant memory to new cloned body to live forever. But is this real immortality? If your body die as soon as you transfer your consciousness, it may seem like immortality but what if your body doesn't die? And this clone with your memory is standing in front of you. Is that clone really you? It's just a copy. Overall, this movie tries to deal with few philosophical topics but at very elementary level. And just copied elements from many other movies that are far more interesting and just made it worse. Actings were horrible too.Good versus evil .... without the 'good' = awful! Saw the great ratings and then was on the verge of bailing for the first time in years. So the first 'intelligent' robot hangs with dope dealing, violent thugs, wears gold chains, swaggers and finally when Chappie tells them he can not commit a crime they easily convince him that by not using his gun he can stop cars, toss the drivers a hundred feed in the air (which might kill them) and take their cars... all the while Chappies can not figure out, with all his 'intelligence' that he has become a major felon like the rest of the gang. Before this mess is over Chappie never saves even one innocent civilian but does manage to draw blood from an innocent armored car driver as he commits yet another major felony. On the sci-fi part of the equation... we know Chappie's creator has invented a program that allows for the first 'thinking' robot. Suddenly, out of no where we're seeing the ability to transfer human's conscience to a robot. No explanation about how or way that is suddenly possible. The IMDb description of the film is nonsensical. Chappie, is hunted when he is seen committing crime and not because he is trying to save humanity. The stars of this film and role model for Chappie are on the verge, several times, of executing Chappies creator. They are low life armed and dangerous dope dealing thugs. Chappies amazing 'intelligence' finds him mindlessly following whomever is the latest person talking to him. Reasoning, morality, free will are out the window. Tell Chappie evil is good and he'll run with it.  Finally a gizmo, the size of a flash drive can put the city at peril. Yet, it seems easy as pie for employees to snatch it and do very dirty deeds. There is way more security on your local bank's safety deposit box. Nonsensical script and a cute named but felony loving, law breaking, dangerous robot. Yes, I was rooting.... for it to END!A new low for scifi trash There are way too many good sci-fi stories out there for Hollywood to be making garbage like this. A better script could have been written by a four-year-old retarded monkey on crack. The story is an insult to computer scientists, security experts, police officials, neuroscientists, CEOs, criminals and anyone with even a mild interest in sci-fi. Suspending disbelief is not the same as turning off your brain completely. It takes a special kind of mentally challenged individuals to accept even one of the following, casually brushed over "details": - Human consiousceness in a USB stick. Really? - A revolutionary robotics &amp; AI company with worse security than an average grade school. - A CEO with an exceptional military weapon in her hands giving up after failing to sell it to a police force. - An AI "child" that learns how to speak through 2 days of casual interactions with humans. The child somehow magically categorizes heists and murder as crimes, but violence and car-jackings are OK. - A human mind-reading casket works just fine on a robot. - A SW developer who first tests his AI on a human-like robot, instead of a computer. Whatever! The consiouscness BS is also disturbingly shallow, but enough said. Some people watch sci-fi films for the CGI and special effects, instead of the ideas. If you're one of them, you may like this trash. Otherwise, stay away.A movie with potential....but it's up as a failure. The movie reminds me a lot of the movie I, Robot with Will Smith. But it's far from being even close to that quality of movie. I would show that movie to some teens though. Chappie is not for anybody under 18-20. I loved the idea of Artificial Intelligence movies. I want to see more. They basically made Chappie into a thug though. His learning process as a true A.I. robot makes zero sense. He goes from being a child to having a complex mind within 3-4 days. A.I. does learn but that pace is illogical. Making him a child for 95% of the movie. Then suddenly in the last 30 minutes he's Einstein smart learning how to upload the internet to his brain basically. Second the thug characters make this movie worse. The story line of Hippo, Yo-landi, Yankie, and Ninja among all the others just bring this movie down. The plot of Chappie, his creator and the creator of the whole U.I. program Deon Wilson and the villainous character played by Hugh Jackman, Vincent Moore. Vincent Moore basically had created his own program of these giant two legged robots which are run by humans controlling them with these helmets that link to their minds. The only confusing part is they are run by human mind but he still has to sit in this chair and have this giant joystick to control his robots. If they lest the stupidity of the Gangsters and left it to Vincent Moore and his robot vs Deon Wilson and his robot army and Chappie this movie would be one of the best of all time. Yo-landi is just creepy and can't act period, Ninja just can't act and looks like an idiot through the whole movie. They make Ninja look smart by how he controls Chappie but at other times they make him look idiotic which again is illogical. Then Hippo is just an angry meathead. I don't see anything good coming from these three characters and their posse in the whole movie.Promising story brought down by Die Antwoord The trailer makes this film seem like a really great piece of Sci-Fi. Having a very promising plot by having AI in robots, future police being robots and grasping the surface of the abstract consciousness; it's a pity they let Die Antwoord in on this. Apart from the great AI plot properties, the whole film feels like an excuse for Die Antwoord to get their crappy music in a movie and for them so play cool and "gansta" in their old crappy warehouse. The movie could very well have left out these idiots for real actors. The computers used in the movie seem very outdated and not capable of dealing with AI in a professional way. One would think that, for advanced AI programming; there would have evolved some more advances interfaces to interact with this phenomenon.Great Looking Movie, Everything Else Stunk 4/10. It would be much lower if it wasn't so beautifully shot, colorful, and uniquely stylish. I just watched this on Netflix, and it's one of those movies I'm so grateful I didn't pay to see in the theater, but wasn't terribly let down watching it on my couch over the course of 3 days. People complain about the acting by the South African rappers, but I didn't think they were any worse than Dev, Hugh, or Sigourney. And when good actors fall as flat as these performances did, you can typically blame the writing and/or directing. This screenplay was hard to swallow. The director gives the audience no credit as the plot is meticulously spelled out in large bold print. Unfathomable motivations drive main characters to behave in ways that only make sense on the back of a hastily scribbled napkin. Chappie has lofty expectations and it felt lacking as it blew into city-wide catastrophe scale.Cute to see how ignorant imagine AI Artificial intelligence is complicated. The concept of intelligence is complicated. That's why people use smart. And it is cute to see the way people who can barely set up their email imagine artificial intelligence. Sadly, they are quite repetitive so the script gets boring fast and never comes up again. Nice try! Sad try. I was left with the impression that the Robocop team had a hard time getting their ideas together. This is some sort of Robocop 3 with emotions. Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.chThis is not your cutesy American sentient robot movie This South African movie is a gritty, violent, funny and heart-touching blend of Robocop and Short Circuit. Believe it or not. The setup is standard: armies of robot police 'scouts' are on the streets, assisting the human police to keep order. There's an earnest, well-meaning robotics whiz who wants to give the scouts more heart. A heartless CEO whose only focus is maximizing profits. A rival robotics engineer hoping to replace the scouts with his steroidal variant. Assorted thugs, mugs, goons, and ne-er-do-wells. And one robot wakes up. After that, it all gets weird. The script is slick, the acting delightful, especially Dev Patel, who pretty much carries it for the human side despite Sigourney Weaver getting higher billing. Unknown-to-me Sharlto Copley infuses the sentient scout, 22, with a winning personality. The filming is competent, though not inspired. Johannesburg is a dystopian character in its own right. Well worth a Saturday evening.robocop remake? didn't anyone else notice the similarities? robot cop with its own mind. big bad robot trying to kill ie, ed 209, and then gets blown up by robocop. evil executive backing ed 209.  this movie looks great, like jar jar in star wars. but its illogical. doesn't follow its own rules. makes a mess out of itself. to bad, great start, then falls apart.Short Circuit meets Robocop! After enjoying the excellent "District 9"(2009),I was hugely disappointed with "Elysium"(2013),so I was pretty much up-In-the-air regarding Neill Blomkamps films prior to seeing this further offering from him. Sadly, there Is nothing here we haven't seen before. Little more than an updated remake of "Short Circuit"(1986) the film nevertheless has It's moments,with plenty of action and explosions(If you like that kind of thing), although the plot Is rather unclear,and It certainly has more than It's share of "silly science". As well as the obvious Short Circuit similarities, the nasty executive with his own agenda makes some scenes seem as If they were lifted directly from the first (and quite brilliant for Its time) "Robocop"(1987), even down to the almost Identical, over-the-top and extra-large Policing unit (called "ED-209" In Robocop), so similar In fact that I was surprised that It didn't end up on It's back, squealing and kicking Its legs In frustration and being unable to get back on Its feet! Indeed, take the aspects of the two aforementioned Movies from the plot and we wouldn't have much left! Explaining things, background story for example, seems low on the list In Blomkamps films, so much so that you're left scratching your head long after the end of his movies. Nevertheless, It's an entertaining film which, like Elysium, would no doubt be favoured more by the younger element, although with a (once again) 15 rating, younger children can't (legally)see It (at least, not at the Cinema)! Perhaps Blomkamp should consider, In future, removing some of the violence and bad language to bring down the age rating. Unoriginal and rather silly, but fun for teens.Piece of crap, but it didn't have to be. The movie premise is quite interesting and this movie could have been truly great. Both District 9 and Elysium had a gritty dystopian feel to them which I truly liked and Chappie does deliver on that. However, the movie completely falls apart as soon as it becomes the Die Antwoord fanboy movie. My problem is not that I dislike them as actors it's that I dislike them as characters and how pretentious their characters are. As a result that splashes over to Chappie and the movie becomes a self contained circle of self promotion. This movie seems to me like someone had a great idea but decided to pull in Die Antwoord and, being the fanboy that that someone is, designed the plot around the personalities they have established and handed them a promotional opportunity on a silver platter forsaking any believable character or plot developments. Chappie could be such an interesting character and the relation ship between him, Deon, Ninja and Yo-landi could have been so interesting if only Ninja and Yo-landi weren't such crap characters.An uneven third work from Neill Blomkamp Writer and director Neill Blomkamp is a South African from Johannesburg who has lived in Canada since the age of 18 and is now married to Canadian Terri Tatchell. In 2009, he burst onto the movie scene with the highly original and surprisingly successful "District 9" written by him and Tatchell and directed by him. His follow-up movie "Elysium" (2013) was much bigger in terms of budget and stars but somehow did not have quite the same bite. Now (2015) he is back with his third work which has more of the feel of "District 9" and, like that first work, is written by him and his wife and set entirely in a near-future Johannesburg. In all three films, Blomkamp uses the genre of science fiction to explore some big contemporary themes, this time how we treat those with weaker mental faculties and what it means to be conscious. Unfortunately the tone is very uneven, flipping from serious to silly. The eponymous robot is played by Sharlto Copley who was in the two previous Blomkamp movies; two South Africa rappers called Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser have important roles but really cannot act; while established actors Dev Patel - and especially Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman - find that their talents are poorly utilised.Hidden Gem - mistakenly thought this was a kids movie I finally watched CHAPPiE almost 2 tears after it was released when I found out Yo-Landi and Ninja of the band Die Antwoord were in the movie. Other wise I would have never watched, the reason being I mistakenly thought this was a kids movie. BTW There are several Die Antwoord songs in the sound track. For me CHAPPiE turned out to be a fantastic sci-fi action adventure drama. It was written by Neill Blomkamp &amp; Terri Tatchell and directed by Neill Blomkamp, both also did (District 9) and has similar style. If you liked District 9 you will surely enjoy this movie. Its to bad the trailer didn't convey the gist of the movie better because the main thing I remembered was a child like robot scared and cowering behind a rock and what looked like a corporate militia trying to get it back like a different kids movie I didn't like. It makes me wonder how many people had a similar impression and thought this was a kids movie so never watched or how many parents took their kids to see it at the theater or rented the DVD only to realize to late it's not a kids movie and be completely dis- enthralled. In my opinion this is why reviews are all over the place, because so many people came away not seeing what they expected. That's a tragedy because CHAPPiE didn't do well enough for there to be a sequel. This was supposed to be a trilogy and I'm sure there would have been an evolution of characters and added complexity to the sequels.Way better than I expected I've been watching sci-fi movies since i was very young, and when i first saw the trailer for this, I expected it to be great. I waited to see reviews before checking it out, and the reviews were so harsh and bad, I skipped it completely.  So, it's 2016 when I'm writing this review. Actually it's the year that Robots were deployed in the film. Anderson Cooper cameo. Awesome, still relevant!  I looked at the metacritic and IMDb reviews, and knew something was off when the user rating and critic rating had such a huge discrepancy. It didn't totally miss it's audience.  I really enjoyed District 9, though I did feel Elysium was not as strong. I was expecting Chappie to be much worse, but surprisingly, it was not.  It felt like a South African spin on RoboCop, with some Transcendence (with better acting and special effects and and, pretty much everything about this movie is better than Transcendence). Complete with the dystopian/dark but still familiar contemporary society. Over the top gangs and villains, robot designs, some gore and plenty of violence. Lots of outdoor action scenes around cars, which seems to be something Neil Blomkamp likes to do. I felt like I was watching a tribute to RoboCop. I also felt like there was some Short Circuit in there. The Special effects were pretty incredible, and real enough to seamless fit in, and also cool enough to amaze and stand out when it needed to.  The concept of a very fast learning child played out fairly well. As a parent, I've watched my son learn and pick up on language, facial expressions and phrases very quickly, and this aspect of Chappie's education really hit home for me. The connection between how his body feels and how human like he is though did require some suspension of disbelief.  The little details: interfaces, computer tech, weapons, costumes, all great. 20 million heist gone wrong (at the beginning), language and accent mimicking, body language.. Still some product placement (see, Windows, Vodafone, Sony VIAO, Playstation 4 (in a cluster!!), 2 of the lead actors are in a musical group... and plenty of cars..  The storytelling: never really an exposition, but all natural go with the flow story, although fairly fast paced, so the plot moved fast, and skipped over some of the plot-lines that would probably take longer to develop in the real world, and unfortunately this was noticeable. Hugh Jackman played a very angry and frustrated character, who descends into a bit of a mad rage, but I can imagine it being all pent up. Deon, very motivated, with vision, and challenges any naysayer (this trait he passes on to Chappie). Ninja, Amerika and Yo-landi - ridiculously poor influences on Chappie, who is a very fast learner, incredible intelligent, but very impressionable, and naive.  This movie had Maker and Existence themes, Death, Human interaction and influence. The weakness of corporations (insider threats). A fantastic ending (which was just a new beginning) 9/10 because this is incredible underrated.Critics are way off with this one. I decided to watch this movie as it had one of my favourite directors in it Neill Blomkamp, the director of Elysium and District 9. This movie stars Sharlto Copley as a police robot named Chappie who has been programmed with a consciousness, Hugh Jackman a jealous and disgruntled employee of Tetra Vaal, Dev Patel as Chappie's 'maker' and the group Die Antwoord as Chappie's parents. The movie is sweet and does not skimp on the action either with an eventual face off between AI and another manned Mech. the only dislike I had was that there was little in the way of plot outside of Chappie's development (Why Deon was not given permission to do what he did for example? Like instant billionaire creation), but other than that this movie was a must see of 2015.Dumb yet enjoyable Chappie- Directed by same person who also directed district 9. I did not like district 9.plot of the movie was awful I thought. This south African director is back again with the movie chappie. The movie starts of very slowly. First half of the movie is pretty slow and kind of boring. Overall the movie was enjoyable but the movie is nothing new. We have seen that plot before. But the director managed to surprise me through out the movie. Very cleverly made movie but the plot is weak. It has its moments.but i am not a big fan of sci movie. Movie is really dumb in few parts. Ending of the movie is really good and innovative. It was like last minute header from Ramos. Hugh Jackman hasn't been utilised to the fullest. He was actually not required for this movie. Dev Patel was very ordinary. Other characters are not professional I think. Chappie's voice is good. This movie scores 66/100 for me. Thanks for the innovative ending. Watch it if you have nothing else to do.Was I supposed to laugh throughout? I went into this expecting something with the impact of District 9. I was sorely disappointed. As an action romp with beautiful imagery it certainly works. But any attempt to describe it as a thought-provoking look at the nature of consciousness and what it means to be human should be met with a roll of the eyes. The plot is dead simple and the attempts at exploring the ideas mentioned above are hamfisted at best. The character evolution also comes off as contrived and forced. The characters themselves are a shadow of what was seen in District 9. They do what they have to in order to move the story, but they lack any real depth. The most important part of any adversarial movie is the antagonist. Without her/him the heroes are just sitting around drinking coffee. Chappie has truly uninspired bad guys. One is an ex-military, ambitious, win-at-any-cost type. The other is a mindless, greedy, thug. Standard stuff. I found myself bursting out in laughter throughout the movie. I wonder, was it supposed to be a comedy? The further on it went the worse it got as things became more and more ridiculousness. Also, the music was terrible.Its eclecticism ultimately becomes its downfall The second collaborative effort for writers Neill Blomkamp (who also directed the film) and his wife, Terri Tatchell, "Chappie" draws heavily for its inspiration from such previous works as "E.T" and "Short Circuit," though it is far less playful and hopeful than either of those two films (though it also channels "RoboCop," which is a little closer in tone).  The setting is South Africa in the not-too-distant future where crime has reached epidemic proportions. The cops are currently being assisted by a fleet of mindless robots and androids in an effort to maintain law and order in the country. Deon (Dev Patel) is an inventor working for a major weapons-developer who's come up with what he thinks is the prototype of a droid with an actual consciousness, one that, for the first time in human and scientific history, can be classified as genuine "artificial intelligence." The trouble is that, before Deon can inculcate him with a strong moral code and, thus, make a model citizen of him, Chappie (voiced by Sharito Cooley) is kidnapped by a trio of street thugs who want to train him to fight against the droids the government is using against them. Soon, a struggle develops between Deon and the bad guys over what kind of moral being Chappie will turn out to be.  "Chappie" is filled with moments of dark humor, but those in search of a sophisticated, timely comedy should be forewarned that the humor in the film consists almost entirely of the naive, innocent Chappie talking and dressing like a streetwise "gangsta'." Because it's pulling from so many disparate sources, the screenplay never establishes anything close to a consistent tone. Part kid-oriented fantasy, part urban jungle melodrama, part technology-run-amok cautionary tale, and part moral fable about what it means to be human, the film is too childish for adults and too dark and violent for children to leave it with much of an audience.  But if you feel you can somehow bridge that gap between conventions and styles, then "Chappie" just might be the movie for you.Needs more fookin' prawns I really wanted this to be awesome. It wasn't. Can't fault the visuals, but everything else was a mess. How can the man who produced the stunning District 9 lower himself to this? Afrikaaners should be prohibited from speaking English, and Anri du Toit is the ugliest woman in Africa. And I hate Die Antwoord.  And their alleged 'music.'  And zef culture. I rate Chappie at 16.65 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a mediocre 5/10 on IMDb.came on showtime I saw it on Showtime and hubby and I were not happy. The storyline could have been better. It reminds us of Terminator in some ways. a basic version of the movie trying to put a consciousness into robots, letting the robot think for itself. I do not like the thugs. one who looks like an old man and trying to be young by talking and walking like he is 19. The woman who is trying to look like an Asian Barbie. The producers should have gotten kids to play the roles. The one who fits in the movie is the Latino guy. He is just himself. The character is a thug. The music is bad. The ending is not too bad because the maker, chappie and yolandi got new bodies. That was cool. It could have been better.Fun movie! This is a very interesting and funny movie. The creators brings us a different plot, with some little jokes and action. I loved to see how a robot with conscience would be with some "swag" personality. Also, you begin to love and create a bond with Chappie. The action scenes are very cool, although it could be better filmed and better angles sometimes, but that's okay. I think if you are with nothing else to do, you can watch this movie and entertain yourself for sometime. Maybe this movie was also a marketing strategy for the Die Antwoord band (the "father and mother" of Chappie are singers on this band). Don't expect something too big on this movie, just sit down and have a break, laughin' on Chappie's swag speeches!Visually effective, but shaky plot and unvaried characters It is not easy for a non-US filmmaker to introduce himself/herself with a sci-fi movie - the Americans have usually created something similar using lots of funds the "smaller" film countries tend not to have. With District 9 and Elysium, Neill Blommkamp from RSA obtained fame and praise, and they are both good movies to watch - even for me not so fond of aliens and robots solving problems.  Alas, Chappie is much weaker than the other two. The plot has too many flaws (particularly regarding Chappie's and gangsters' "evolution"), leading roles are performed by mediocre actors (big names like Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman in small and static roles), and the share and angle of visual effects is more characteristic of B-movies. In the course of 2 hours, we can see this and that, crumbly scenes, odd solutions (incl. ending) and too many clich√©s and foreseeable twists. Even if I realize not being a member of target audience, I would have expected meatier experience than I got.6.9 ... again 6.9 out of 160k+ people? Go buy yourselves a pair of new glasses! This movie is the movie of all movies. It is a trigger of a bunch of emotions. It touches every single part of your heart, soul, everything. It brings you every single piece of plot element you would imagine to have in a single movie: humanity, love, a bouquet of emotions, conversion of characters, comedy, action, sci-fi ... I just don't know how some of you have the eyes to give it a score of less than 10. Sorry, Chappie, 11 is not available as an IMDb score option. Neill Blomkamp, Terri Tatchell thank you for the fantastic film. The touch you possess has given birth to a movie that is like the Internet of emotions, morality, humanity, amusement, imagination, comedy, action all interconnected at the very same place. Dev Petel, Yo-Landi Visser, and all the rest of you - big applause for the great actor play. You know something I've thought after watching the movie - Chappie is a simple looking robot, it's not the fancy ultra-turbo- hyper-mega looking robot with millions of shiny looking ultra-modern parts on it. As Yo-Landi said: "It's important what is inside." The outside- inside contrast is an absolute masterpiece. A simple way to show great things. My admirations.Ummm Surprisingly good for me I put off watching this because of all the negative reviews. I watched it today because I only had an hour and off to work. So watched it thinking this was a movie where I didn't need to see the whole thing. I ended up watching the whole thing and wasting time to write a review to combat the negative ones.  The effects were pretty damn good. I can understand why it got bad reviews. Some of the characters are over the top, but hey I have never been to South Africa so maybe its possible there are people like that. If you can make yourself believe that, the movie was entertaining. Made me wish like District 9 and unlike Elysium that there will be sequel to this movie so I can see what happens next. Alas I don't think this movie made enough money so the chances are pretty slim. Too bad.Excellent movie, another platinum master piece from the director of District 9 and Elysium Not sure about all the critics. Don't really know what people waited from this movie, but I don't care, not really. This movie offers in-depth characterization of every human being here on this planet. Chappie doesn't offer any super-hero types of actors, nor any awesome people. They have Ninja and Yo, they're more like junkie/alternative type of people. Chappie is a good willed dummy, with good heart, and main hero (Creator) is a random Indian guy, with normal attitude towards life. I really like how Blomkamp painted out the "core" of our society and this world, even in this movie. All of his movies are about how normal/standard/simple people react, how they act at extraordinary situations and at life-threatening situations. He has no heroes in his movies. Only normal people, real people, the same ones You meet in every day life. I really love the "human" part of Blomkamps movies. And as for Chappie, this movie left a strong impression in me, really strong one. It's all about dedication, fear, humanity, the true humanity, love, hatred, understanding emotions. And also, the effects and stuff around was superb. Hasn Zimmer took care of the OST and visual FX are the best You can get. When I saw District 9 in 2009, I was ultra-impressed by the visual FX in the movie, mostly the atmosphere the Blomkamps was able to capture within the scene(s). In Elysium he went a bit further, and here in Chappie he stroke platinum. I really suggest to all Elysium/District 9 fans to see this movie. If You liked those, there's no need for You to not like Chappie. When watching Blomkamps movies, You need to put away all the prejudice and clich√©, he uses clich√© situations a lot and also his stories are kind of predictable. His movies aren't about surprise. His movies are about humanity and faith in love beyond death/horizon on life.An unpredictable blend of emotions I loved this movie, there are a lot of aspects that deserve appreciation, but the one that needs to be most appreciated is the lack of clich√©s. Chappie, a spent police robot, damaged in action, is brought alive by its Maker, and from there on, we see how this robot with an independent consciousness transforms the emotions of the people around him. The way the computer programs are projected on to the audience is really neat, photography is above average, soundtrack suits the setup. This movie really isn't the "Terminator" type, I feel sorry for people who expected it to be so. This movie is more about the emotional journey of a robot and it's impact on his friends. A must watch movie.A True Disappointment, I Expected A Lot More Considering Who Was Involved It's hard leaving previous loyalties behind. I think we want to love Neil Blomkamp's work unconditionally. I also think when most people saw the trailer for Chappie we saw that it was from the director of District 9 and we all started jumping up and down and there's nothing wrong with that. District 9 is awesome, one of the best science fiction movies ever made and although the reception of Elysium was mixed I found it to be a fun action/science fiction mix although it wasn't deep like District 9. I wasn't sure about Chappie as there seemed to be a disparity between negative critical reception but most of the crowd reports were positive. I decided to see Chappie and I couldn't have been more disappointed, this was probably the worst movie I saw last year. *Minor Spoilers Ahead* The film starts with a documentary style telling of how police robots were created to control crime in the city of Johannesburg, South Africa. These robots were created by the company Tetravaal and have been a resounding success. The chief developer for these robots was Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) and although the robots are selling well and his superior Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) is happy with their performance, Deon has been working on a side project. He has developed an artificial intelligence program and wants a chance to test it which is denied by Michelle. But Deon decides his program needs to be tested and he steals a damaged police model robot and tries to bring it to a secluded area for those purposes. But he is intercepted by a group of gangsters Ninja (Ninja), Yolandi (Yolandi) and Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo) who have recently run afoul of a gang lord named Hippo and are in debt of $20 million. They take the robot, thinking that with the advantage of having a super soldier on their side plus perhaps inside info on the police, they'll be able to execute a heist to gain the money to pay off Hippo. Also important to know is that in the Tetravaal office is rival developer Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) who has developed a different prototype which is more keyed towards being aggressive, as opposed to Deon's more low-key and functional robots. Vincent doesn't like Deon and is looking for an edge to take Deon down. When I talk about a movie that I didn't like, I try to get to the positives first, no matter how small they are. The locations are suitably dirty and gritty, the design of the robots is interesting and they're well animated (even though the MOOSE is basically a giant murder bot, it at least looked cool). I thought Sharlto Copley's vocal performance lent a lot to Chappie (he out-shined the rest of the cast despite never appearing on the screen as his performance of Chappie was not motion capture, the character was CGI). In terms of positives, that's about all I have. The biggest problem with Chappie isn't the acting or the ideas the film was created around. The problem with Chappie is the predictability of the plot and the awful characters. Starting with the characters, there isn't a single likable one in the movie. Chappie is supposed to be our hero and you want to latch onto him but he's too much of a blank slate, he has little personality and he's being manipulated into doing awful things by awful people. Deon is compassionate towards Chappie but he's a wuss and even though he's dealing with dangerous people his expectations of both them and his creation are unrealistic and removed from reality. Yolandi is the closest of our gangster characters to being human but she knows what they're doing to Chappie is wrong and goes along with it. Ninja and Amerika aren't remotely decent people, they're essentially Chappie's abusive step-dads, beating him up and feeding him bullshit. When they face the inevitable turn towards redemption, it happens on a dime and I didn't buy it. Lastly, Vincent is just a cardboard cutout of an evil adversary and Michelle is just your typical corporate disapproving boss who delivers stock lines and is just a plot device. The plot is completely predictable and when it deviates from formula it's dumb. The larger progression within the story, you can see coming after 20 minutes. When looking at the finer points of the story, I found myself either in complete disbelief or laughing. Chappie's intelligence jumps around rapidly, he can't understand that shooting or stabbing someone can cause death to believing he can solve the problem of life after death. Ninja, Yolandi and Amerika blindly believe that if they can come up with $20 million Hippo will let them go when it's clearly not about money. The fact that the design of Vincent's robot could be used for anything other than mass killings is a joke. It's the small things that made this movie so nonsensical to me that I couldn't take it seriously. The dialogue is also terrible. I haven't talked about the acting but all you need to know is that even though this is a cast full of talented people, they can't overcome the lacklustre material. A lot was made of the performances or Ninja and Yolandi because they aren't actors by trade, they're rappers. I would agree they aren't very strong but they aren't as detrimental to Chappie as they have been made out to be, the movie is weak around them not vice versa. When I heard Neil criticize himself for not spending enough time on Elysium's story, I was shocked. Elysium seems award worthy next to Chappie. I wanted this to be good, I didn't go in wanting to hate Chappie but it was what I described, a big disappointment. I hope Blomkamp can rebound from this, he's extremely talented but he's on a slide, let's hope it's short lived.Bottom-Of-The-Barrel Sci-Fi Perhaps if Hugh Jackman had suddenly pulled a "Wolverine" in Chappie, then, yes, that actually might have saved this asinine, Sci-Fi mess from sinking right down into the absolute dregs of terrible "big-budget" movie-making. (At least temporarily, anyway)  With all of the millions of dollars that was sunk into this pathetic clunker, I would have at least hoped that its producers would have insisted that the Chappie character have a uniquely interesting voice - 'Cause, sorry, but, actor Sharlto Copley's irksome vocal qualities didn't do the trick. No way. Neither cool, nor hip - As Chappie's story progressed, it got more and more stupid by the minute until I ended up loathing every single character in the story, including Sigourney Weaver's annoying, bitchy "ice queen". And, even though Disney Studios did not produce Chappie, this dumb movie contained all of the earmarks of something that one would expect from the likes of those clueless dictators of schlocky entertainment."Where suspension of disbelief dare" The plot is simple: strong and capable robots mounted on titanium chassis, with some sort of A.I. (without consciousness) are built in order to do the job humans don't want to anymore (taking bullets and heavy fire). At a certain point a damaged unit is sent for scrapping, but the genius Indian boy (who said Indians can't program? Hah!) who invented their A.I., turns out to have compiled the first artificial consciousness in the world and he's going to install it into this defective unit. From there a gangastah robot will become the first A.I. of the world. The viewers are advised on the beginning to arm themselves with a great suspension of disbelief. First of all I can't understand why it is said the robots are made of titanium. Even if it is 5 times stronger than steel, you can't expect the chest hull can stop a .50 BMG. Unless you have let's say 30 or more cm thick armor. They built robots capable of superhuman feats, I'd expect to see titanium skeletons covered by much more technological carbon polymers. Then even if we can believe those robots are made out of titanium, I can't even imagine how many weak points they have. Sensors on the head are exposed and easily to target as well as the CPU, a single circuit with a usb-port shielded from the external environment by a simple 5 mm thick titanium plate. So, a defective unit is going to be updated by a consciousness.dat - I must confess that even an amateur programmer like me can't believe you can write a C++ or c# consciousness and including it into a single archive. I would expect Prolog, or something similar, not the same logic you program your everyday pc programs. They just need a simple way for Hugh Jackson to remote turn off all the scouts at once with one single file creating the cheap kill switch ever. After Chappie is a teenage gangstah like robot, he figures out a way to use a sensor helmet capable of reading human brain activities, in an helmet able to read the "consciousness" of a living being (robotic or human, yeah whatever). I can understand the helmet can read human brains ... how can it work with a piece of hardware such as Chappie? His brain is an overclocked Intel i7 with some Nvidia GPUs and a few giga of RAM - it's 2016 and their idea of a self-conscious brain is an IBM compatible device enclosed into a titanium hull. Hey it was 1980 when Star Trek The Next Generation said the android Data had a "positronic brain" made specifically to simulate human brain activity. And then it comes Hugh Jackman and still I can't figure out why he does carry his gun around the office - Texas' style - while being an engineer, and while he had been a ... what, NSA agent? And the movie ends with a bang, meaning it becomes bloody and splatter with a sudden change of style. Not a bad movie but we've seen better.Chappie The Crappie I saw the high rating on IMDb and gave this movie a shot. The trailer looked decent and reminded me of good action scenes in District 9. I wanted to leave while watching the movie so many times. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. Chappie, the crappie, the robot, gains sentience. He can think for himself, though he starts out like a child that must be taught everything. This is the core of the movie. Clearly, the writers meant to create a sweet metaphor about the tribulations of growing up, but what they created was two hours of pure cinematic torture. The acting, plot, and action sequences were often cringe inducing, not to mention laughably illogical and ridiculous. I seriously can't imagine how anyone could enjoy this movie. The consciousness BS is also disturbingly shallow, but enough said. Some people watch sci-fi films for the CGI and special effects, instead of the ideas. If you're one of them, you may like this trash. Otherwise, stay away. Shame on you Neill Blomkamp. You let us down in many ways. Minus many stars for wasting, insulting exceptional talent. 4/10 only for amazing production values and CGI. Everything else is garbage, including the choice to have Chappie's AI "learn" in a totally absurd manner.Could have been much (much much) better I am so sorry to see such a great story being messed up so much by few unprofessional scenes. I think that Hugh Jackman and few other actors have done what they're expected to do, but most scenes of the "creator", and the "gang", who had the major roles in this movie, have completely ruined the story, changing it from a serious, hard-core sci-fi movie, into a messy and cheap comedy.  I would put "Real Steel" and "Transformers" in a level way above this one, although the drama and emotional development in the story of "Chappie" is better. Yet, thanks to the unprofessionality of few scenes, I saw the movie turned into a sequence of boring pictures.  This is a movie that had the potential to be one of a kind, but it turned into a waste of .. almost everything.Funny, sad, badass, and deep. People who couldn't enjoy this SCI-FI movie are missing the point of a science-fiction movie. Key word: FICTION. And great fiction at that. Casting Die Antwoord was genius.Good God, the Plot Holes I couldn't get past the first half hour because nothing made sense. It looked good, though.This movie is the bomb I agree with every single person that has commented positively on this movie. It is simple fantastic. Makes me wanna trail the rest of the director's movies.My mind exploded From the illogical nonsensical things. I can't stand watching it longer than 15 mins.Another movie critics wrongly trashed and sheep didn't give a chance Very, very good movie. Only saw it in theaters because i saw promise in the trailers and liked Bloomkamp's District 9. I actually gave it a chance and it was great. Lots of other people just acted like sheep and came in hating it, coupled with the emphasis on South African culture, people didn't give it a chance. Seeing movies like this fail shows that change is coming to the movie industry. Plenty of great projects are just being trashed undeservingly because audiences never get a chance to make opinions for themselves.Artificial and unintelligent Such an awful waste of time and a disgrace to the makers of District 9 and actors. Very poorRobo baby. This is a weird sci-fi dystopian movie about a robot being born to an Indian creator who loses him to some wannbe gangsters and what appears to be South Africa. The robot named chappie is a metaphor for The Human Experience as we all experience. He goes through trials and tribulations to eventually learn what it means to be human as a robot with and expiration as we humans have. Throughout the course of this movie we eventually sympathize and empathize with a robot who is used and abused by the systems of surrounding him as his only goals are to keep living.I Cut Onions Throughout the Film I saw this in the cinema and loved it. I recently purchased the DVD to watch again and it made me realise what a sappy person I've become in those 3 years. I had way too much pathos for the childlike kill bot, Chappie. Chappie (the film) highlights just how corrupt, self serving and downright cruel humans can be. The titanium bubba really wasn't shown much love throughout the film.  So why watch it? Because Chappie is such an endearing, likeable character and his character arc is fascinating to watch; you get to see Hugh Jackman play a mullet wearing bully-boy who bandies about Australian idioms (which, as an Australian, we really don't say) with aplomb; robots- killer robots everywhere! I feel like if you've seen any of Neill Blomkamp's films you know what to expect. High tech, abused innocents and psychotic villains. It's just with Chappie, some of the psychotic villains show more compassion than those on the side of "good".  I know why this film divides viewers. The acting isn't slick (but for me it adds to the realism) and the story isn't the most cohesive or believable- but hey- it's escapist sci-fi- not a bio-pic! Watch Chappie. It's a dystopian Aesop fable with heart. That we should all be as honest and decent as that flicky-eared assassin.A pleasant and intriguing watch I was already familiar with some of Neil Blomkamp's work, namely District 9. Viewers of that film will recognize his style in the use of TV newsbits (featuring a very real Anderson Cooper segment) and documentary-style filmmaking to drive his point home.  Yet what makes this film a standout is the way in which it portrays AI, making the experience seem almost relatable to that of fathering a baby. While the movie does take a few predictable turns, and the climax is stretched-out beyond belief, it is a decent piece of work and one that took me by surprise at a few moments. The amount of emotions the film conveys are surprising, given that the main character is supposed to be a robot, but we come to love and care for him nonetheless through his struggles in the slum.  The actors do a terrific job of harnessing these emotions, and conveying all the ethical quandaries that one would have creating AI, but also raising a child. Dev Patel, as always, is fantastic. Hugh Jackman does a wonderful job of making an otherwise-unbelievable villain slightly more human, but the real spotlight goes to Ninja (south-african rapper who portrays a fictionalized version of himself in this film) and Yolandi Visser as Chappie's "parents", namely the thugs who try to give him an education. Their evolution as characters, particularly Ninja's, is fun to watch throughout the entire movie, and provides a redeeming storyline parallel to Chappie's own. Finally, Sharlto Copley steals the show as the title character, even if his role is essentially a voice one, by making us believe that Chappie's angsts are very real, and that yes, robots can have a soul.  I must say Chappie's literal evolution as a character was pleasant to watch, and, while the action at the end was a bit overkill, it helped make this is a very decent film. While this movie helps to open a conversation about AI, don't trust this film to venture too far into it. Instead expect a fun, decent and intriguing sci-fi movie with a premise not-all-that unbelievable.The other side of AI, the beautiful one. Its not the same old "Artificial Intelligence taking over the world" kind of a story, but begins with the inevitable and obvious,disruption of human society. What leads to this you ask?watch the movie and find out. Its my first Neill Blomkamp movie, and I must say I relished every single moment of it. The concept of AI had to be introduced by some nerdy-brainy scientist-programmer and that role was played by Dev Patel. Ex-military turned engineer, the main antagonist Hugh Jackman was the main reason I wanted to watch the movie in the first place. And of course, not to forget the main lead, Chappie himself, voiced by Sharlto Copley. The fact that this movie doesn't take place in New York, or any other part of the States prone to alien attacks or rise of deadly zombies, is comforting. The evolution of the character Chappie is a beautiful journey. A loving and caring mom, and a drunken mean father, also a understanding uncle, are the roles played by the supporting cast. The story does show the ugly side of human nature, with every single person being self centred. The 'maker' Dev Patel wanted to test his newly developed AI program and used Chappie as a test subject. Ninja plays the role of a daddy who again tricks Chappie into crimes for his personal gain, and looks at him like he is nothing more than a pile of talking metal chunk. Hugh Jackman, jeopardizes the safety of the whole city, just so that he can test his own "superior drone" and taste success,on which Dev Patel was basking till now.His superior drone, is literally over-kill and ruthless, literally cutting a man in half. In all this self-centeredness and mayhem, Chappie doesnt lose his humble and kind hearted nature. Not only that he makes you love him by his childish antics in the beginning, makes your eyes moist as he feels pain(actually he can't) but he surpasses his creator, his 'maker' and creates something bigger, better, something which only can be dreamed of. Exactly that should be the purpose of AI, to go beyond capabilities of humans to create something more. Every other film,(or at least many of them) focus on the dark side of AI, but this one shows that if nurtured with love, AI can help solve the ultimate question, making fiction into reality. One more thing that I really like, in any movie is to end it with a question which makes viewers want more, which keeps the possiblity of the second part alive, which can continue to live on its legacy and take it forward. Chappie is a really under-rated movie, and if you want to watch something beautiful such as a robot more human than its creator himself, then this makes up for a really touching and rewarding affair.Tripe The basic storyline should have been OK - gangsters steal a police robot that happens to be an AI prototype, and reprograms/trains it to act for them - helped by the AI expert.  However it is nonsense that the AI expert having been kidnapped, beaten up and then released by the gangsters, keeps returning to them and his robot again and again, effectively assisting the gangsters. He does this out of of love for his AI prototype (which has a ridulously cute personality) and his wish to teach it art and poetry. It does not occur to him to inform the police of the theft and the gangsters whereabouts, nor to the gangsters that he might do so.  SInce the stolen robot is physically a standard model, and the AI program looks like it is on an SD card, you wonder why the AI expert could not have continued his experiments with another robot another time. Did he fail to keep a copy of the AI software?VFX , Characters too Good But No Storyline Please Make Sequel but a good story...why criminals has the story...I expected a lot first... if hugh develops enemy robots and dev patel develops good robots ..both of them will fight against with some emotional's , twists , humanity etc with robots ...it might have been worked well..No worries you can improve in sequel with this storyline.. Thank youWhat if Jar Jar Binks was a ROBOT?!? Neill Blomkamp created a masterpiece; a film that perfectly balanced visually stunning effects with a compelling plot and characters, and that film was District 9. Then came the shallow mess that was Elysium that while lacking a likeable protragonist still managed to be a treat to the eyes at the very least. Then came Chappie. I really wanted to like Chappie, a lot. Some of the best ideas are the simplest, and in spite of the negative reception I could see much potential in a twisted comedy action film about a good-willed robot being trained by scumbags. This isn't the case with this film. Many of the elements I had expected were in play, however the tone was relentlessly sinister and dour where a more levitous approach would have been vastly more interesting. The film feels too mean-spirited to be enjoyable. The gangsters Chappie finds himself involved with are beyond trashy in the worst kind of way, and upon realization that they would be a large portion of the next 2 hours of my life, I was filled with dread. Chappie isn't flawless himself - his benevolence going against any notion I have of "realistic" robots. Chappie is quite simply a human character placed in the husk of a robot, and once I got past that I soon found myself annoyed with the repetitive scenes of Chappie in peril and confusion, always responding with squawking and sulking, giving me that feeling I have when I'm being beaten over the head with a message, only it seems the message is missing. Hugh Jackman plays a one-dimensional baddie not unlike what you'd get in a Saturday morning cartoon. His only motivation is that his weapons were shafted in favor of the crime-fighting robots, so then he turns to terrorism I guess. I guess this is where that missing message is; mean people are bad, and you should just be a good person, and robots are people too. Everything in this film is simply surface level, when the only way it could have had a chance is by being deep - higher highs, lower lows, and stronger motivations. The worst part is I feel like the film ended right when the story was just getting started. There's a chance for something here, but this trilogy is otherwise dead on arrival.Good robot coming-of-age story 'Chappie' is Blomkamp's third film, after 'District 9' and 'Elysium' and easily sits between them in terms of quality. It's a near-future tale of artificial intelligence and how this could play out on a small and large scale. It's nothing new ('Terminator', 'Short Circuit'), but it is done in an interesting way. Deon (Patel) develops "scouts" (basically literal robocops), which Vincent (Jackman) wants to supersede with his mech-warriors. When Deon creates an AI "conscious", Chappie is "born". Unfortunately for Chappie, his "parents" are Ninja &amp; Yo-Landi from 'Die Antwoord', a South African rap-rave "band" (thanks Wikipedia. If you haven't heard them before, don't bother!) I can only assume Blomkamp loves their music (god knows how) and asked them to be in this as a favour. Their faux-gangster act forces Chappie into doing things he doesn't want to and disaster ensues. Jackman is adequately douchey as the Aussie-redneck, Sigourney Weaver is massively underutilised, Patel is solid and Copley is great as the South African-accented voice of Chappie, providing most of the laughs due to his interpretation of sayings. The visual effects - particularly of Chappie and the other scouts - is superb. There's not too much philosophising on the impacts AI could have on humans/the world. The ending was a little drawn-out and obvious - not necessarily good or bad.New &amp; Bold - critics and tightwads can't relate Everyone of the bad reviews are from people that are like the CEO that Sigourney Weaver plays in this movie.. screw them and enjoy this movie. Those people want all the bad people to act like the Rock or some crappy approved stereotype. People who hate this movie are the same people that wear the same clothes their bosses wear and loathe anyone that comes in with any original style. How dare they! There was no memo sent out that says we are allowed to like and enjoy Die Antwoord!! So we must trash them!! The movie is top notch and a lot of fun which is what all these people are so bent out about.. they are seeing people having fun and being free and they HATE that since they gave that up long ago and this reminds them painfully how tightwadded their lives are now This movie is priceless and will be watched over and over decades from nowBlomkamp delivers more smart sci-fi, but this time with more heart Another smart science fiction film from writer/director Neill Blomkamp ("District 9" and "Elysium"). This story is set in Blomkamp's home country of South Africa, where the story has police forces now primarily consisting of new robotic police officers built by a private contractor. The scientist behind the robots wants to further his research by improving the artificial intelligence of his creation, essentially creating a super smart self aware child that he can teach. The company president, Sigourney Weaver, doesn't like the project so the scientist decides to run his experiment off-site with stolen parts, except that he's highjacked by a street gang who force him to build his robot and then raise the child-like robot to be a gansta super criminal. Much like Blomkamp's other films, this one has a clever and original story premise, but takes it much deeper. The film on the surface is an action packed story of corporate greed and the moral/ethical implications of AI, but "Chappie" has a much deeper subtext beyond that. At it's core, it's a story of nature vs. nurture and hooks the audience on a human level, particularly for anyone who's every raised a child. The responsibility and the decisions one has to make in how you want your child to view the world are immediately identifiable to any parent watching this film. Where the film falters is a subplot involving a competing scientist at the same company, played by Hugh Jackman, who wants to sabotage the police robot program to swing Weaver's support for his more tank-like security droid. That part of the story felt like a retread of the Robocop vs. ED 209 plot line from "Robocop" and was nowhere as interesting as the more human of drama happening around the raising of this childlike robot. Overall, despite it's flaws, "Chappie" works on a simple entertainment level, but also works on an intellectual level if you're looking for something smarter than your average sci-fi summer blockbuster.Great story and great sound Chappie is a film about a rejected robot and his creator on a journey about self-discovery and finding friendship in the most unexpected places. This film stars Charlto Copley as Chappie. Chappie is a robot on the streets, programmed to fight crime. During his time on the street Chappie is shot, blown up and is eventually broken beyond repair. During this time Deon Wilson (Dev Patel), Chappies creator, is working to create a better artificial intelligence that would allow the robot to have feelings and free will. This new creation was dismissed by his employer and he resorted to stealing Chappie to test the code. Deon Wilson's main antagonist is Vincent Moore, played by Hugh Jackman. Vincent will do anything to show his robot, Moose, is a more viable robot. The final main characters in the film are Yo-Landi as herself and Ninja as himself. These two are common criminals who kidnap Deon and end up taking care of Chappie. This film is filled with great sound and camera shots to really provide a depth to the film. The sound effects and music are filled with digital notes that provide layers of sound to enhance the scenes and provide additional depth to the visuals in the film. In the scene where Chappie is shot with a rocket launcher there are digitize notes integrated into that music, that seemingly add a crispness and structure to a chaotic scene. The music and sound effects are like those in District 9. The sound designer for both Chappie and District 9 is David Whitehead. Through the sound design e is able to bring to life the world where Chappie and Deon live.  Another technique used in the film is close up camera shots. As Deon is working on the new artificial intelligence, he records himself with a webcam as he begins to do his evening work. The camera angle is zoomed in tight to his face and has him centered in the frame. This scene really shows the work Deon has been putting into this project. When he looks into the camera you can see the passion and excitement, he has for the project, even when he has failure. Another scene with great camera angles is when Chappie is working to download all the information from the internet to help him understand. In this point of view shot Chappie is looking at a wireless modem, images and pictures are cycling on the screen as if he was learning more and more. The personal camera angles and great sound design really provide the ground work of a story about self-discovery.An Adorable RoboCop (Flash Review) I primarily chose to watch this for the Hans Zimmer soundtrack, which did not disappoint and energized many scenes. This movie attempts to portray the meaning of life by personifying a robot with artificial intelligence installed and a friendly voice. Chappie was part of a robotic police department in a gloomy future. He was badly damaged in a battle and marked for destruction. An AI engineer recovers the robot and installs his AI prototype software into it. Later kidnapped by hoodlums, Chappie is being taught wrong morals in the mean streets. Will he get rescued by his 'maker', will he be trained to do the bidding of violent thieves or learn to stand up to them? A couple messages of the movie are that humans can be very bad life forms as this learning Chappie AI is more selfless than many real humans and also how easy it can be to corrupt innocent people. Overall, the movie's tone was awkward as it was an odd mix of happy moments are rather bloody violence. Arguably a few plot holes or strange character decisions but it did a great job at giving a grubby robot a wide spectrum of real emotions."Chappie"- Almost a great film. Almost. Worth seeing for all it does right despite its many faults. It might seem almost paradoxical, but I found myself quite taken by the bulk of the film "Chappie" despite the fact that honestly... it's a pretty wonky film when viewed as a whole. Director Neill Blomkamp's tale of artificial intelligence and criminal corruption was a peculiar release in 2015 that garnered a generally mixed response from both critics and audiences alike. Some applauded it for asking big questions and delving into a classic morality tale of what constitutes life and purpose. Others despised it for its unlikable characters and messy narrative structure. And me? Well, I'm somewhere in the middle. Able to recognize and condemn its faults while still finding great value in the elements and aspects of the story that do work. In the not too distant future, robotics and programming expert Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) has helped to create the "Scouts"- robotic police androids that are licensed out to help take back the streets of Johannesburg from criminals and gangsters. One day, Deon secretly steals a damaged Scout body to use as a guinea-pig for an Artificial Intelligence experiment... only to be kidnapped by a group of common street-thugs (Ninja and Yolandi of the rap-group "Die Antwoord", Jose Pablo Cantillo) who wish to use the robot to pull heists and make dirty money. Dubbed "Chappie", the "newborn" AI operates on the same level as a young child, and is pulled between his decent creator and his violent "adoptive family." At the same time, Deon's work rival Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) learns of Chappie's existence and, viewing him as an ungodly creation, vows to destroy him along with the other Scouts in order to push forward his own robotic-police units... In many ways, "Chappie" is a frustrating watch because it's almost a great film... but it's not quite there. It's an almost perfect inversion of that old saying "The whole is greater than the sum of the parts." All of the individual elements at play in "Chappie" are engrossing, compelling and incredibly enjoyable. But it doesn't exactly come together. The film's biggest fault is the fact that the writing feels rushed and patched together- like Blomkamp and co-writer Terri Tatchell had a lot of brilliant ideas for different parts of the story, but couldn't quite fit them together and rushed into production without a completed script. The pacing is weird, there's some bizarre inconsistencies in the structure, and just a few too many moments of convenience and coincidence. It needed another draft, plain and simple. And that should be the kiss of death... but it's not. Because everything else works so well, that I found myself very willing to forgive the troubled writing and shaky foundation. The story has some clever ideas and heady themes that I found fascinating, and I loved the fact that Blomkamp and Tatchell allow the movie to operate in a morally grey zone- they raise questions, but often leave the answers up to the audience's interpretation. As always, Blomkamp's visual direction is a phenomena, and his sense of scope, composition and color is just awe-inspiring. His films always have a unique balance between gritty realism and melodramatic hyper-reality, and he nails that in "Chappie" in the best of ways. And I found all of the characters quite compelling in their own ways. Heck, you might very well find yourself growing attached to the robotic Chappie and the criminals who are "raising" him more than the other, much more human and humane characters. This is aided by surprisingly solid performances from basically involved. Patel is a joy as always, and it's great seeing him on- screen once again. Jackman is a delightfully slimy villain who seems to be having a blast chewing the scenery. And heck... I even though Ninja and Yolandi of Die Antwoord did pretty darned good. Particularly Yolandi, whom grows close to Chappie and begins to mother and nurture him in a genuinely loving way- forming the film's strongest emotional through-line. But of course, the incredible Sharlto Copley shines through as the voice of the titular Chappie. Copley might not be a household name, but he's quickly become one of my favorite actors working today with his incredible turns in films including Blomkamp's own "District 9" and the underrated "A-Team" feature film. And his wondrous and childlike take on the character of Chappie is another strong win for Copley. At the end of the day, it comes down to this. "Chappie" is almost a great film. But it's not. It's messy. It's uneven. And it has a ton of problems. And yet... I feel that it does enough right to be worth checking out. It has interesting themes, plenty of entertainment value, a beautiful scope and fine performances. And to me, that makes up for most of the problems I have with the shoddy writing. I'm giving "Chappie" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Give it a shot. You might like it.You think you're real? A wonderful movie about humanity and what we define as existence. The movie is placed in 2016, South Africa as crime has increased a local weapons manufacturer replaces the human police enforcers with droids. However the lead designer of these droids is working on making sentient AI program. After being turned down by his supervisor, he proceeds on his own and his work abducted during a car jacking. Chappie has some comical real world elements, but is a very serious look at human nature. It shows there is no true line between what we call good and evil. It questions the meaning of existence and explores the definition of the soul. Most characters are all motivated by impending death, either physical or financial, and sometimes both.  All the work on this film was done with excellent care to details. The dialog, the acting, the effects, and direction are all great work. My only complaint would be the blurb at the beginning of the film talking about events ahead of the movie was nonessential. If you skip to the CNN anchor talking, it would have been a 10/10. So 1 point for editing? Action packed and an ending that has you begging for a sequel.The Black Sheep Many people have some unconditional love for certain directors. Well, so do I. But that doesn't mean that it should be near completely impossible to approach new material from said director on a somewhat critical level. District 9 was one of my favorite film released after 2000, and still is . I just saw a screening of Chappie in Oslo yesterday, and, I'm sorry to say though, but Chappie was literally the stupidest film that I've seen since the 80s. I get the analogies to real-world politics and current situations in Blomkamps movies, and I admire him for trying to incorporate just that. It worked slick as hell in District 9, failed a bit flat in Elysium. But in Chappie, there really is no end to the logical flaws, extremely underdeveloped characters, rushed, fairytale of an excuse of a storyline to push events in the movie forward etc.  I study anthropology myself, and the questions of ethics, racial/social discrimination and problematization of basic human nature that Blomkamp raises are always very intriguing to me. Unfortunately nothing works out in those areas in Chappie. The relationships that Chappie himself develop with the other characters was quite interesting, but the movie played out more unbelievable than any Dolph Lundgren flick from the 80s. I admit that it could be me failing to see the tongue-in-cheek action-homage here. And I should note that a lot of people in the cinema applauded at the end. But it should also be noted that a lot of the people in the cinema had quite a few beers, I suppose.  I had great expectations on the philosophical questions to be raised in Asimov's spirit, and looked forward to a few laughs, and some great action in between. I had a few laughs for sure, but besides that, I thought it was genuinely bad, if not abysmal.District 9 has Competition This movie was brilliant - Definitely much better than Elesyum. Niell managed to involve all the action, drama, comic relief and special effects, but still managed to keep an interesting story and interesting characters with exquisite Blomkamp flare. The dynamic were slightly clunky, but every film has things wrong with it. Many complain that the accents weren't up to scratch and, kind of annoying; but what they didn't realize was that that was what made the character (Chappie). It set him apart from the rest of the world. People also didn't like Hugh Jackman's character, but I found he was still an engaging character, even though he might seem generic at a glance. Some might argue that the story has been use dozens of times in movies, but never before has a movie presented it in such a way, with the gritty realism and different mix. This movie is a must-see - 10/10Frenetic, overblown, and yet under-developed, this mash-up of 'Robocop' and 'Short Circuit' is a jumbled mess made from recycled parts of much better sci-fi equivalents It's a good thing Neill Blomkamp secured his next directing gig before his latest went into wide release; indeed, 'Chappie' marks yet another costly misstep that threatens to send his career the way of the Wachowskis. Its premise of an artificial intelligence becoming human is by now a familiar one, but rather than build on what its predecessors had to offer, this childish and noisy spectacle fails to develop any of its themes, be it the oft-repeated idea of consciousness or its social allegory of class divisions. Set once again in Johannesburg in the near future, 'Chappie' opens in the same way as 'District 9' with mock news footage establishing how the police have commissioned an elite team of human-sized droids ‚Äì called 'Scouts' ‚Äì from a robotics firm known as Tetravaal to restore law and city and reduce the body count for the force as well. The 'Scouts' are the brainchild of an idealistic inventor called Deon (Dev Patel), whose creation is hailed by his company's CEO (Sigourney Weaver) to the consternation of a jealous colleague Vincent (Hugh Jackman). Unlike the 'Scouts', Vincent own invention dubbed the 'Moose' requires direct human control, and has understandably been sidelined as his company banks its future on greater deployment of the 'Scouts'. Their rivalry is supposed to set in motion a series of events that leads to our titular character taking on a much more heavily-armed 'Moose' in the overblown finale, but any sort of meaningful build-up between Deon and Vincent is cast aside in favour of a gangsta subplot that is frankly misplaced. Celebrating his love for his homeland's rap-rave group Die Antwoord, Blomkamp has cast both members as low-life gangsters Ninja and Yo- Landi (played by the group's Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser), who in the opening sequence following the scene-setting newsreel are seen to have bungled a heist and now owe their boss Hippo $20 million. To procure the compensation owed, Yo-Landi comes up with the laughable notion of obtaining a remote control so that they can switch off the Scouts. The search for that 'remote' leads them to kidnap Deon, just as the latter has prepped one of the decommissioned Scouts ‚Äì or 'Scout 22' as he calls it ‚Äì for his experiment in synthetic consciousness. By simply uploading a data file he created, Deon turns that scout into a thinking and feeling robot who is also taken together with his inventor and earns the affection of Yo-Landi. It is Yo-Landi who gives him the name 'Chappie', and in turn, Chappie calls her 'Mommy' and Ninja 'Daddy'. Almost the whole second act is dedicated to Chappie's learning as a sentient being, which is disturbing to say the least. On one hand, Mommy teaches him English, reads him bedtime stories and encourages him to go pursue his dreams. On the other, Daddy and his accomplice Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo) try to manipulate his fundamental mental constructs in order that he may assist them in their heist of an armoured vehicle. The fact that many of these scenes are played as comedy without any acknowledgment of its anarchic undertones only reinforces just how tone-deaf Blomkamp's movie is, so much so that Chappie's questioning of our human failings ‚Äì expressed in his confusion why humans break promises and do bad things ‚Äì rings hollow and even hypocritical. There is no apartheid allegory here, but it is clear right from the onset that Blomkamp's sympathies still lie with the disfranchised in society. Though that posture may have worked in 'District 9', it feels shockingly misplaced here, in particular since their 'tutelage' leads only to violence, crime and death. It doesn't help that Chappie isn't an endearing character in his own right, coming across as a hyper-active chatterbox without nuance or restraint ‚Äì and Chappie remains an unrelatable character from start to finish. Despite his efforts at trying to get his audience to identify with his character's struggle to develop a mind and soul of his own ‚Äì not just what his 'maker' programmes himself to be or what he has been taught to follow ‚Äì Blomkamp fails to make good on an intriguing theme that several other filmmakers have explored to much, much better effect before or draw any poignancy out of it. Between Chappie's incessant chatter and Blomkamp's attempt to pack as much diffuse plot into the runtime, there is hardly any space given to explore the intellectual notions that the movie flirts with (but never indulges in any serious manner). The same idiocy unfortunately extends to its stock character archetypes. Patel's inventor is never given any motivation why he developed a consciousness for his androids in the first place. His rival played by Jackman is no more than a cartoonish villain, and even embarrassing for the A-list actor. Weaver continues a streak of playing the thankless supporting character, but the most ill-advised bit of scripting and casting has got to be the triumvirate of Ninja, Yo- Landi and Amerika/ Padillo, who are not only caricatures through and through but some of the more off-putting ones in recent memory. Sharlto Copley does a capable motion-capture for Chappie, but that work is sadly overshadowed by a character that could absolutely do with an overhaul. Ditto for the whole picture in fact, which recycles themes from much better genre equivalents and gives them a South African underbelly spin that frankly doesn't work. Blomkamp's flair for staging a propulsive picture (with some help from an equally intrusive score from Hans Zimmer) is still intact, and so is his verve, but 'Chappie' is hyper-frenetic, over-plotted and yet under-developed at the same time. It is not even 'Elysium', which Blomkamp has in recent weeks admitted that he 'f**ked up'. We only wonder what he is going to say about 'Chappie' when he starts doing his rounds for the next 'Alien' movie.Fun movie Here is my review of #ChappieMovie ...I really really loved it!!! (I only wish I wouldn't take that last seat in the theater which was on the first row!!! My head was ready to explode) so the movie just collected everything -it was funny and it was so sad sometimes ..then it was full of action and murders and blood ...lol but really entertaining and cool:)) I fell in love with Chappie))) and oh my god #DieAntwoord were amazing in the movie:)))) they played so good!!! I'm gonna listen to their songs again now:))) I remember I was a big fan of them:)) overall -funny and sad and some drama and full of action:)) I'm reading now bad reviews on different websites but I really really liked it and the whole theater was applauding at the end!!!:))) #ChappieReally good but feels slightly disappointing when compared to Blomkamp's past work Let me start off by saying I am a massive fan of Neil Blomkamp's work, District 9 being one of my top 3 favorite movies of all time and personally, I believe Elysium gets way more flack than it deserves and that film is very unfairly criticized. Going in to Chappie I was extremely excited to see what Neil could do next and I came out satisfied. Chappie boasts some great action, generally very good performances, a fantastic score and is completely entertaining throughout. The flaws of the film however are definitely there and hard to overlook. Starting off with the inclusion of Die Antwoord. Their presence in the film seems rather forced especially seeing them wear shirts with their names on them and listening to their own music. The whole thing seems out of place and I do not think they should have been the people to play such important roles in the movie. Brendan Auret's characters also feels rather over the top and silly yet underused. Another problem is that the film feels slightly too familiar with some of it's occurrences as it progresses, and coming from a huge Blomkamp fan I would now like to see him branch away from this type of movie, hopefully starting with his upcoming Alien project. Overall, Chappie is a fun time and is definitely worth going and seeing in the theater however it can't help but feel like a slight letdown considering the talent.just bad If you are looking for an action scene, too bad, this movie offers little to none of it. If you are looking for drama about robot trying to understand what he is and asking for human acceptance, then no, this movie offer none of it. What this movie is offering is a constant shake on your head about how unreasonable these characters in this movie act, how sloppy the plot is and how distorted the science behind this movie logic. Overall, this is a very bad movie for me. too many plot hole, characters are too dumb to act reasonably, little to none good action scene to compensate its bad parts, and how science works in this movie is just wrong.Blockbuster Demands Neill Blomkamp might be one of the most fascinating storytellers in blockbuster filmmaking today. His Sci-Fi stories are basically an allegory of the third world culture. Chappie now tackles the subject of being raised in a troubling environment. The movie becomes real engaging when it sticks to that mode, but the same problem of the director stays, as his enthusiasm of blockbuster filmmaking makes its important theme seem lost. It's not bad adding some explosions, except the major conflict of the plot bogs down its potential, turning it into a generic action film and also has a dumb climax with an ending that hardly makes sense. It should have been straightforward with its social analogy, because there the movie becomes really gripping. There's actually two stories involved in Chappie: one is how humans fear the artificial intelligence and how it would affect to the future of their society; the other is a robot who has to choose whether he is going to choose two paths: the wish of his maker or the life of an urban thug. The second story is much fascinating, Chappie is often described as a child who is still learning how the world works. The film makes some compelling points on how the robot influences from the reality; the good and the bad. But the film keeps getting hindered by blockbuster elements with a generic arrogant corporal villains, and of course, giant robots and bigger guns. The explosions are fine, but the ideas towards that side hardly felt like it belongs there, or at least helped improving the storyline. It might have first thought that it would make it more thrilling or entertaining, but the gangster side felt more natural at this concept, probably leading to a much powerful experience in the end. But when the third act comes, it keeps sprinkling more ideas that makes its core even more complicated. The movie is more intriguing when it keeps things smaller and slow, putting aside those bombastic battles and political conflict. The acting is alright. Sharlto Copley is in motion capture as Chappie and he brings a palpable full of energy, he decently captures the robot's growth in his environment, he may not be given a full character, but the performance keeps the character shine anyway. Dev Patel obviously does well as the film's serious heart of this weird world. Ninja and Yolandi plays the fictional version of themselves, which feels pretty self-indulgent, but does fine to the picture anyway, in spite of still wearing the merch of their Die Antwoord and the movie they are in. The best talents ended up playing the most unnecessary villains; with Hugh Jackman goes over-the-top as the villain who you'd love to hate (a lot like Stephen Lang in Avatar) while Sigourney Weaver is underused in a role that actually doesn't do much to the story. It seems like Chappie fears that it won't fit in today's realm of loud blockbusters, it's definitely not bold enough to be honest with itself, which is a shame. Blomkamp comes up with these interesting stories, but unable to fully comprehend with its actual message or something else. There is still a talk about the consequence of having artificial intelligence walking among us, but the movie is more powerful when it stays at its allegorical roots, getting to know the dark side of the streets and growing up in a violent world of crime, while struggle with fragile moral dilemmas, but as a blockbuster, it demands more explosions and clashing CGI effects. It's less interesting at that point. Chappie deserves more tweaks, I want Chappie to be better than that.Too Much "Consciousness" (Minor spoilers) Let me start off by saying i'm a huge fan of Blomkamp. In my opinion, District 9 is one of the best films of the last decade, and I'll forever love him for that fine work of metaphorical beauty. Chappie on the other hand tries to deliver the same experience but with the director and writers' hands tied behind their back as they try to flesh this out. I fell in love with the concept of this film since Tetra Vaal was released. When Martin Scorsese gave the writer of Wolf Of Wall Street, Terrence Winter, the plot of the movie, he said he wanted the same feel and pace of Goodfellas. Neill must've taken that on to himself with writing this compared to District 9, along with similarities to Elysium. (Sigh) A big disappointment to everyone, I know, yet it was a great concept! Also, believe me when I say that Chappie is one-hundred times better than Elysium. So, on to the film itself. The first twenty minutes are great, setting the real story of the film. Clich√©s aside, it goes well for the first half. Then ambiguity started to sink into the writers' heads and brought on an Elysium-type concept. Too much concept, not enough great writing. I'm a fan of Die Antwoord, the crazy rap experimental group that takes up three- fourths of the film's screen time, and I was pleasantly surprised by their performances. I don't think I'll be seeing them at the Academy Awards ever, besides maybe performing some outrageous song, but nevertheless, good acting. As the story continues, Yolandi's time with Chappie grows on you and you quite to really enjoy the chemistry of great voice-acting from Sharlto Copley (playing Chappie) with his immediate sympathized character love that you could compare to the Prawn species in D9, and maybe even Elephant Man. The art concepts of Die Antwoord's palace as you may call it was a beautiful touch by the crazy group, and gave it a good feel for fans of them that they were playing themselves. (Also retaining their stage names). Dev Patel's screen time is nothing compared to Die Antwoord's which was bothersome, and even more so; Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver. Remember how in Elysium, Weaver had five minutes on screen? She has three in this. With no character development, and no sense of even being a character. Hugh Jackman was a clich√© jealous coworker but did shine with some direction from Blomkamp in some scenes. Emphasis on some. The fact that they practically brought this robot police tank-like fighter straight out of a mash-up of D9's ending, Robocop, and Avatar made it feel unoriginal. Sixty minutes into the film, you're still liking it. And the scenes between Yolandi and Chappie still hang over everything else. The use of the "Black Sheep" story is a nice touch, but hangs a little too close to being overused, Next, we have the last twenty-five minutes. Warning: laughter of ridiculous ambiguity ensued from me, along with the small audience I sat with in the cinema. Remember when in Avatar, they use a machine to transfer your consciousness into some other body? Here it is, being even more ridiculous. I won't get into it, but wow is it cringey, along with just bad writing. A fight scene that's so well setup turns into a backtracking mission of wounded "protagonists" and death scenes that don't make you feel anything. Originality gets squashed and turns into a slo-mo scene of Michael Bay garbage. At this point, my friend had dropped his popcorn on the floor mistakenly, but ended up becoming a metaphor for how bad this film became. Fast forward an awful fifteen minutes of Interstellar-type- ambiguity-nonsense, and here we are. One person after another, getting their consciousness into something else that I won't mention, making this movie dumber by the minute. The last shot opens it for a sequel (God, please don't make a sequel) and makes you "wanting" more. I wasn't feeling any desire for this film to go on or be dragged into a worse sequel. I know I speak mostly ill of this movie, but I give it a 7/10 for good directing for most of it, and a new take on some old concepts that go back to the 80s. Great VFX (which I usually hate in nowaday superhero films and the fantastic (sarcasm) Transformers franchise. Pros- - It's fun. - Smart writing for three-fourths of the film. - Sharlto Copley's voice performance, along with Die Antwoords'. - Some original concepts. - Blomkamp's fun directing style. - Great VFX. Cons- - Falls flat on its face towards the end. - Forced emotion. - Too. Much. Ambiguity. - Not enough screen time for the "stars". - Writing gets dull. - Clich√©s all over. - Overall undeveloped concept that could've been way better.'Chappie' finds beating heart in artificial intelligence 'Chappie' is a feature length Die Antwoord music video, and that's not a bad thing. The South African rap-rave group star as alternate reality version of themselves in director Neill Blomkamp's third feature, and influence nearly every aspect of the film's production. Their songs blast through the movie, they tattoo the robot Chappie with various spray-painted images from their discography, and etch illustrations in the background of numerous locations.  The casting choice is a risk that Sony remarkably allowed ‚Äì casting two musicians with relatively scant prior acting experience in a big-budget blockbuster.  It's these chances that makes 'Chappie' so special.  It's a 21st century retelling of the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz, if the Tin Man was hip with current slang and wrote hilarious posts from a twitter account.  The film opens in the slums of Johannesburg setting that Blomkamp previously utilized in his previous movies 'District 9' and 'Elysium'.  The crime rate has plummeted since the police department deployed armed robots called Scouts. We follow the Scouts creator Deon (Dev Patel), a Red Bull chugging scientists who lives in a house cluttered with small android helpers, the interior of his home recalling the talking furniture in an episode of 'Pee-Wee's Playhouse'.  After an insomniac night of research, Deon discovers the secrets to artificial intelligence, and delivers his findings to the company who manufactures the droids. His boss Michelle (Sigourney Weaver) rejects his proposals, and Deon sneaks out a damaged Scout without permission for experimentation.  A radical competing engineer and former soldier Vincent (Hugh Jackman, sporting questionably high cargo shorts) campaigns for overkill security measures in the Moose, a murderous tank of a weapon operated by remote control. The creation is rejected, and a scorned Vincent is intent on sabotaging Deon.  The robot is intercepted by Yo-Landi Visser and Ninja of Die Antwoord, who give him the name Chappie and train him for a heist to pay off a debt to a maniacal thug.  Sharlto Copley performs the motion capture to perfection. Credit must be paid to the visual effects department, who detail Chappie's movements from na√Øve infancy to swaggering gangster outlaw.  'Chappie' journeys down paths reserved for ambitious independent and foreign films, resolving in an outlandish ending that leaves the possibility for a reported trilogy.The lack of originality and occasional stupidity of some of the characters hinder your overall enjoyment of the film--though it IS entertaining No matter what anyone tells you, "Chappie" is basically a South African re-working of the RoboCop franchise. So, when you see it, while you might enjoy it, you cannot help but compare the film to the others. Because of this, the film certainly is not original. But, despite this, it is modestly entertaining. There are tons of explosions and shooting and the way that the new police android, Chappie, learns and grows is interesting to watch. But, the film also has a serious problem--the writing. While there are some really interesting parts to the movie, it also occasionally has HUGE lapses of intelligence. For instance, Chappie is stolen by criminals--really, really bad criminals. They also kidnap Chappie's maker and force him to activate the droid. And then, they just let the guy go!!! Later, this devoted programmer returns to see and work on his creation AFTER the baddies threatened to kill him if they ever saw him again...but they don't!! Late in the film, one of these same super-evil villains even tries to save some lives by trying to sacrifice his own!!! Where is the consistency and believability?! There are other examples of these unevenness...but frankly it's a film you best watch by just turning off your brain and enjoying it if you can. If you can't, it's going to be a long, long viewing experience. By the way, although I love South Africa and would love to visit it again, Johannesburg really IS this scary in real life and setting the film there is appropriate. Visit this lovely country-- especially Cape Town or the countryside. Just be careful when entering Johannesburg.Blomkamp dropped the ball on this one South African director Neill Blomkamp's debut movie, DISTRICT 9, remains a masterpiece, and his follow-up ELYSIUM is a very good piece of action spectacle. Sadly, the magic isn't repeated for this, his third film, an odd concoction of rehashes of old material and disappointing new elements. The first thing you notice about CHAPPIE is its familiarity. The whole robot cop thing is heavily derived from ROBOCOP and the presence of an ED-209 style robot makes it even more obvious. Secondly, the idea of a sentient, learning robot brings to mind the glory days of the SHORT CIRCUIT film in the 1980s; they were childhood favourites of mine. Plus the social milieu and gangster type stuff is familiar from the director's previous films. Sadly, CHAPPIE makes the crucial error of failing to have the protagonist be sympathetic at all. The reliable Sharlto Copley does his best with the voice and mo-cap work, but Chappie is just a mildly annoying robot, nothing more. Attempts to turn him into a gangster take up much of the running time, but the non-actors who play the gangsters overact for the most part and are very annoying. It's a pity that this film feels so directionless, because there's good stuff here. The CGI effects are exemplary, as you'd expect from a Blomkamp movie. There's not much action, but the big set-piece climax is very well staged. A supporting turn from Hugh Jackman is one of the best performances in the whole thing, although Sigourney Weaver is wasted in an extraneous part. When you sit down and watch CHAPPIE, you see the framework of a part-decent movie buried beneath a lumbering and uneven execution, and I think that's a real shame. Let's hope Blomkamp can pick it up again for his forthcoming ALIENS movie...annoying gang Crime in Johannesburg is out of control. The government uses robots from the Tetravaal Company run by Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver). The Scouts are designed by Deon Wilson (Dev Patel). Ex-military Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) has his design called Moose but nobody wants it with the Scouts being so successful. Deon develops a revolutionary AI and has secretly programmed it into a damaged Scout. Meanwhile, criminals Ninja, Yo-Landi and Amerika need to make one big score to pay back crime lord Hippo. They come with an idea to kidnap Deon to get a remote for the robots. Instead they also get learning robot Chappie. The criminals are really off-putting. They are more like Mad Max wannabes than anyone scary. Ninja is way too silly and Yo-Landi is way too maternal. The first problem comes when they let Deon come and go as he wishes. I don't understand Ninja's logic. He's a horrible kidnapper. Also the company has horrendous security. Neill Blomkamp has something compelling to say but it becomes a mess. Chappie is like a gangster Johnny Five with less charm. I never hated Vincent as much as the movie wants because I never liked Deon and Chappie that much.Flawed, but Entertaining In Johannesburg, the police department reduced the high rating of criminality using robots from the Tetravaal Company, designed by the engineer Deon Wilson (Dev Patel). The former military Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) is envious of Deon, since he has developed another project called Moose, but neither Tetravaal nor the police department is interested. Deon has just developed an Artificial Intelligence but the Tetravaal's CEO Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) asks him to abort the project. Deon decides to bring the damaged Robot 22 that was sent to be crushed to test his A.I. However he is kidnapped by the criminals Ninja (Ninja), Yo-Landi (¬•o-Landi Vi$$er) and Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo) that want him to stop the robot cops. When they see the damaged robot in the van, they force Deon to program it to heist banks with them and they call it Chappie. However, Chappie acts like a child and need to be trained to learn and grow. Meanwhile Vincent follows Deon and plots an evil scheme to activate his robot.  "Chappie" is a flawed but entertaining film with "robocops" fighting against crime. However, Tetravaal is totally unbelievable as a security company with the easy access of employees to the facility and software. Considering that all Johannesburg is dependable of the robots, it is ridiculous the lack of protection of the company and how easy Deon Wilson and Vincent Moore go there during the night and access the systems using only a key. The concern of Chappie with mortality and the discussion with his creator is taken from "Blade Runner". The corny decision of Deon, running after Chappie instead of activating the robots in the chaotic city is also silly. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "Chappie"Chappie I saw many clips and trailers for this film, and it was commented on Film 2015 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh, it certainly looked like a worthwhile watch, directed by Neill Blomkamp (District 9). Basically in the city of Johannesburg, South Africa, in the near future, crime is at a record high, to combat this the government has the streets patrolled by state-of-the-art, armour-plated A.I. attack robots, manufactured by American weapons company Tetravaal, developed by British engineer Deon Wilson (Slumdog Millionaire's Dev Patel). The robots are an instant success, wiping out most of the city's most powerful drug and organised crime gangs in a matter of months, this overshadows the competing project developed by Australian soldier-turned-engineer Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman), a remotely controlled larger robotic machine called MOOSE. Deon has a new project in mind, he has created a prototype artificial intelligence that mimics a human mind, feeling emotions and having opinions, but Tetravaal CEO Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) refuses to test this on a robot, but he ignores this and steals a recently damaged robot to put together himself. On the way home however, the van Deon is driving is hijacked and he is kidnapped by a group of gangsters: Ninja (Ninja), Yo-Landi (Yo-Landi Visser), and Yankie - or Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo), they threaten to kill Deon if he does not build and reprogram a robot to fight for them to carry out a robbery to pay a 20 million rand debt to powerful gangster Hippo (Brandon Auret). Deon builds the robot and installs the new software, he explains that the robot will react and have the mind of an infant child, so when it is activated it is scared, but slowly responds to Deon and Yo-Landi's calm approach, the robot learns and imitates new words, and from Yo-Landi using the phrase "happy chappie", they name the robot "Chappie" (District 9's Sharlto Copley). Ninja's gang have only a few days to pay the debt, but if Chappie is going to help them they need to give him time to develop, Ninja forces Deon to stay out of their hideout until he is needed, he is keen to teach Chappie many more things, and allow him to express himself, including painting, but Ninja instead teaches him swear words, defence and gun use. Ninja decides one day to put Chappie on the streets to make use of his taught skills to fend for himself against other gang members, but he ends up damaged with an arm taken off, he gets a replacement, and when Deon visits he teaches Chappie things that are right and wrong, specifically he makes him promise not to commit crimes. Meanwhile Moore is using the locater at Tetravaal to find the software stolen by Deon, he is able to find the reactivated robot that was due to destruction, he is shocked to witness a robot with a conscience, Chappie does in fact carry out the robbery of cars to be sold, but he believes it is to get the money needed to replace his dying battery. Moore uploads a virus that deactivates all police robots, including Chappie, this only allows hundreds of criminals to riot on the streets, Deon is determined to help Chappie and takes him to Tetravaal, there Chappie notices the helmet used to control MOOSE, back at the hideout Chappie re-engineers it to enable his consciousness to be transfered into a computer, and change bodies. Bradley has ordered Chappie to be destroyed, and Moore is allowed to activate MOOSE to assassinate, a battle ensues, Amerika and Hippo are killed and Deon is mortally wounded, Yo-Landi sacrifices herself to save Ninja, enraged by her death Chappie drives Deon to the factory and fiercely beats Moore close to death. Chappie is successful in transferring Deon's consciousness with the modified MOOSE helmet to the body of a spare robot, and Chappie's battery dies, but new robot Deon is able to wirelessly transfer his consciousness into another nearby police robot body. In the end robots are discontinued and the police end the contract with Tetravaal, grieving Ninja finds a flash drive marked "Mommy's Consciousness Test Backup", which contains Yo- Landi's consciousness which was copied when the helmet was tested, and Chappie and Deon go into hiding, and Chappie is able to hack Tetravaal's manufacturing facility to build a new robot resembling Yo-Landi. Also starring Johnny K. Selema as Pitbull and Anderson Cooper. Copley as voice and physical mannerisms of the title robot is really likable as the child-like, expressive and intelligence growing machine with a soul, Jackman is a little forgettable, and Weaver gets her moments as the corporate boss, this is essentially a cross between RoboCop and WALL-E, with perhaps a hint of Pinocchio, the robot torn between right and wrong has mixed results, but it is paced well enough, and it has brilliant special effects for the simple machine movements and the explosive action sequences, overall it is a science-fiction thriller worth watching. Good!"RoboCop" meets "Short Circuit" Concerns over the use of drones to kill people and the use of military equipment by police make Neill Blomkamp's "Chappie" more relevant. The use of an all-robot police force recalls "RoboCop", while the concept of a droid who has human qualities brings to mind "Short Circuit" and "AI: Artificial Intelligence"*. Although some scenes in the movie come across as silly, I interpreted it as a warning about over-reliance on technology for law enforcement. The South African setting makes sense: four decades of institutionalized racism gave way to one of the highest crime rates in the developed world. In the end, I recommend the movie. It's understood that Chappie simply wants to be able to live like everyone else. The plot holes don't drag the movie down at all. Sharlto Copley, Dev Patel (of "Slumdog Millionaire"), Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman put on fine performances. *Another movie focusing on a robot with human qualities is "Robot &amp; Frank", starring Frank Langella and Susan Sarandon.Comparing If a movie has a robot in it, that is part cop, the comparisons with Robocop won't be hard to find. But this is a different beast altogether. Trying to get into a discussion about machines, souls and after-life. Not everything gels in perfectly and nicely. But the director does a good job with a lot of elements. Something that might have spun out of control, but it didn't. While the name Chappie might remind some of dog (food) and I can only guess that was intended, there is more to Chappie than just being a "pet". Chappie is getting and learning things fast as you'd expect and the lines between good and evil blur at times, if not through the whole movie. That might be tough to handle or accept for some, but if you do roll with it, you'll see a very entertaining movie, that can give you food for thought ...Yeah, a pretty strange movie but is worthwhile if you stick with it all the way. I found this on DVD at my public library. I began watching it with my wife, she gave up and left after about 30 minutes or so. It was when the robot Chappie was being taught by its new "parents" and things were getting pretty silly. But I stayed the course, I am usually determined to watch a movie all the way through. I figure if the writer, director, and actors thought a story was worthwhile then I'd give it a fair chance. There are lots of rough edges in this story, many things simply don't add up even in a Sci-Fi movie about robots taking over as cops in Johannesburg, S.A. But the concept is interesting and the eventual resolution (after the SPOILERS warning below) is charming.  It is basically a story about a robot and its creator. Dev Patel is the egg head computer scientist Deon Wilson, mostly responsible for the pre-programmed robots that are used to fight crime. But he has a larger ideal, to truly create artificial intelligence. A robot that can learn and make decisions.  His work nemesis is Hugh Jackman as Vincent Moore, who has created a whole different robotic fighting machine. It is larger, has jet propulsion and lots of destructive weapons, and it is controlled by the operator wearing a head device that allows him to control the robot remotely, in the safety of an office. Vincent wants the regular robots to fail so that his brainchild can be the chosen weapon. In a nice touch to Sci-Fi Sigourney Weaver is the business boss Michelle Bradley. She doesn't care too much about the technology, she just wants the business to make money. I enjoyed it. Not all of it, but overall it is an entertaining movie. Subtitles are often required to understand the mumblings of some characters. SPOILERS: Deon manages to sneak out a damaged robot, scheduled for demolition, and manages to transfer an artificial intelligence program to it. But the robot, later named Chappie by its captors, is stolen by a small band of crooks who want to use it to help them steal millions of Rand. But this leads to a much larger confrontation with Vincent and his robot. Deon in the process gets shot, is dying, but Chappie facilitates Deon's intelligence and awareness to be transferred to an unused robot right before Deon dies, so as the movie ends both of the robots, friends now, decide what to do and how to elude capture.A society in the future is protected by robots. In a futuristic Johannesburg, the crime rate is reduced using specially designed robots. An advanced humanoid with Artificial Intelligence is stolen quickly after his creation. He is named Chappie and is caught up in a battle between the inept criminals, who snatched him, and the money-hungry weapons developer that created him. Some impeccable visual effects and a plot that slow drips social commentary. Can easily grab attention of high school kids, but will probably patronize or insult the adult viewer. There is some intrigue at first, but can't find fault with someone discovering stupidity. CHAPPIE is a fun watch. Cast includes: Dev Patel, Yo-Landi Visser, Jose Pablo Cantillo, Sigourney Weaver, Hugh Jackman, Maurice Carpede, Brandon Auret and Sharlto Copley as Chappie.Is Blomkamp A One Hit Wonder Like so many people I really enjoyed Neill Blomkamp's DISTRICT 9 one of the very best science-fiction films in recent years that fused cerebral social comment with exciting fast paced action sequences . I missed his follow up ELYSIUM but couldn't help noticing from the trailers that it had the same visual look as the director's prior film , an opinion that seemed reinforced by the rather lukewarm reviews ELYSIUM received . With CHAPPIE my spidey senses were tingling that we'd be getting more of the same along with a pastiche of similar films such as ROBOCOP and SHORT CIRCUIT . Add to this a rather poor marketing campaign that saw parents taking their children to the film only to lead them out again when they realised there was violence and very bad language . Even the title CHAPPIE gives the impression the audience are going to be watching a twee Disney type film and you might just be expecting a massive own goal where marketing is concerned  To be fair CHAPPIE isn't a massive disaster but is ill thought out on so many levels . First of all Blomkamp seems unable to leave whatever comfort zone he had in DISTRICT 9 . The film starts with talking head interviews and news reports that we had in D9 and it's only when the characters mention droid cops that I was reminded I wasn't watching D9 . We then get a high octane shoot out in a Jo-Burg slum and again I was left with the impression I could have been watching out-takes from the action scenes from D9 with the droid cops superimposed over the action . To its mild credit the film then does start taking on an identity of its own but here it starts to hit serious problems that have been mentioned - the tone . I can't emphasise how schizophrenic the film starts becoming . The titular droid and its developer Deon get kidnapped by some nasty foul mouthed criminals from the slums and these criminals are often incapable of opening their mouths without a string of expletives coming out . Later on we get a female crim reading Chappie a story like she would a child and it's like watching a mawkish family film complete with incidental music to go with it . I'm unable to emphasise how often this jarring shifts in tone happen or indeed why they happen . I think the angry parents who dragged their little ones out the cinema have only themselves to blame for not researching a film beforehand - this is an era where something can easily be researched via the internet - but by the same token this is by no means a family film yet someone bizarre segments suggest it might be  CHAPPIE isn't a complete dead loss and I did like it in parts . Much of the film is helped by the casting of Dev Patel as Deon and he's always been good at playing sympathetic characters who have no problem getting the audience on their side and he continues in this type of role . Also as in the past director Blomkamp knows how to make great action scenes but at the end of the day CHAPPIE isn't a rip roaring action thriller anymore than it is a family film and one wonders what sort of film the production team were trying to market ?"You gave me a retarded robot." I really liked this one. There's some obvious '80s influences here, from the criminals looking like something out of a Mad Max movie to the Short Circuit and Robocop elements. There's even a bit of a He-Man cartoon shown at one point. It's an intriguing and certainly entertaining movie, if not an overly original one. I think some critics are unhappy with the lack of pretentiousness that was present in Neill Blomkamp's previous work. Here the "messages" are more universal and less political. Some people only like their sci-fi if it carries with it an obvious metaphor for a topical social injustice. You can even find such metaphors here if you try but subtlety is not a zealot's cup of tea. Overall, I thought the script was good and I really liked the upbeat ending. Another nitpick I have about the modern critic is that they think the only good sci-fi story is one with a downer ending. The special effects are pretty amazing. The acting is solid all around. Dev Patel, Yo-Landi Vissir, Ninja, Jose Pablo Cantillo, and Sharlto Copley (voice &amp; motion capture for Chappie) are all great. Hugh Jackman has a rare turn as the villain here and does a terrific job, even if I do hate the obligatory clich√©s his character is saddled with. That haircut, though... Maybe it's not for everybody. I have friends that haven't seen it yet that I'm fairly certain will bitch about it and pick it apart, like I see from many reviews on here. But that's their loss. I'm happy that Blomkamp tried to make a movie that's not dumb by any stretch but also isn't just aimed at the elitist film snob crowd or soapbox bloggers.Plenty of Heart but Could Use Some Insight and Intelligence An Uneven Screenplay that Waivers All Over the Place Making it Hard to Know How to Relate to Certain Characters, Especially "Daddy", This Third Film from Director Blomkamp is Still a Touching and Action Filled Affair that is Somewhat Underrated. It is Ambitious but its Ambiguity is Apparent at Every Turn. It Doesn't Follow its Own Logic Most of the Time and Leaps About with a Frenzied Pace that Does it No Good. Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman Barely Register, but the Rest of the Cast Make Their Mark Albeit in Somewhat of a Blur. The Titular Robot Character is Charming and Engaging and has the Audience Rooting for Him. There is a Rush to End Things with the Transfer of Consciousness Thing and the Movie Ends Up Feeling a Bit Unfulfilling or At Least Unwilling to Contemplate its Own Conceits About God (The Maker) and His Creation. Overall, it is Worth a Watch Because of "Chappie" and Some Excellent Action Scenes, but One Comes Away Wishing the Movie Would Have as Much Insight and Intelligence as it has Heart."RoboCop" meets "Frankenstein" by way of "E.T". A winning combo of whimsy and wow! CHAPPIE (2015) ***1/2 Sharlto Copley, Dev Patel, Hugh Jackman, Sigourney Weaver, Ninja, Yo-Landi Visser, Jose Pablo Cantillo. Superlative sci-fi from wunderkind filmmaker Neill Blomkamp - who co-scripted with Terri Tatchell - set in the not-too-distant future in crime-riddled Johannesberg, South Africa - where a corporate run police force weighs in on its latest tactical ops - a robot with artificial intelligence that can reason, learn and feel emotions in spite of the costs of potential threats to its wielders - to wit: a rag-tag trio of punk criminals out to make a heist with the eponymous prototype (motion-captured to a t by Copley enfusing a child's beguiling awe to everything it comes into contact with) designed by Patel and enviously wanted squashed by his villainous college (Jackman practically gnashing his teeth and growing horns; one of his lesser turns I'm afraid to admit and demeriting the rating by a 1/2 *). Incredible state-of-the-art visual effects, a bombastic yet propelling score by Hans Zimmer and grand mix of epic violence and heart-warming poignancy in this hybrid of "RoboCop" meets "Frankenstein" by way of "E.T". A winning combo of whimsy and wow!Mixed As may really happen soon(and this is set in the not too distant future, somewhere in time¬Ö), and yet goes completely unexamined(and it's not the only compelling concept it fails to do much with), humanoid robots, Scouts(or, y'know, Homeland), largely replace regular police. One falls into the hands of a rather unlikable and one-note trio of criminals whose protagonist status is trying our patience, because of the former, not the latter. Chappie(Copley, sweet and charming, doing both well-integrated motion-capture and voice-work) is granted consciousness, and this innocent, childlike(yet rather powerful, able to kick through brick walls like it's nothing) being deals with different influences and goes through the range of human emotions with us finding ourselves touched, cheering him on, or scared¬Ö for or of him. Blomkamp delivers on both his good and bad tropes, and we end up with something in some ways better than Elysium, and it is thankfully less simplistic, mainstream and ridiculously one-sided, left-leaning(and I say that as a major Liberal). There are major problems with the characters. Moore(Jackman's mullet being as badass a presence as usual ‚Äì yet here, we're afraid of who he'll hurt and how, instead of hoping he'll get there soon and get one of the really bad people that way), a former soldier who's¬Ö Christian? Or is that a joke¬Ö? Anyway, he's built a remote-controlled mech suit which is completely overkill for crime fighting(which may be satire of the recent militarization of such) which has been turned down. He has fun, and we vicariously enjoy the taste of the scenery. The other names are wasted, Weaver in particular. And that leaves us with earlier-mentioned obnoxious ones. The action, whilst largely free of cool guns(don't get me wrong, the various bullet delivery systems on display, especially with how tricked out they are, are badass) is great. The ending and the opening are from different movies ‚Äì to each other and to this one. Unpredictable and fast-paced to the point where it forgets its own plot threads¬Ö the entire climax feels tailored and sacrifices scope in the name of focus, when a few rewrites could have addressed that much better. I do get a bad feeling that Neill is running out of ideas. With all the similarities between his three films, he almost should have pulled a Sin City and placed them all within the same universe. There is a lot of brutal, violent and disturbing content, as well as a little sexuality and full frontal female nudity(because it can) in this. I recommend this to fans of the subgenre. 7/10Flawed, yes, but not terrible When I first learned of this movie coming to theaters, I was excited about it, seeing that I had admired director Neil Blomkamp's "District 9". Then the largely negative and brutal reviews came out, and that cancelled my plans to see it in theaters or to pay any money to rent it on video. But when I came across a DVD copy of it at my local library, I decided to give it a look, seeing that I would be able to watch it for free. After watching it, I am kind of puzzled by why the movie got an extremely hostile response. Yes, the movie is not perfect; it has some flaws, some severe. The script steals some ideas from other movies, most notably "Robocop" but even Blomkamp's "District 9". The various human characters are those that we have seen many times before, from the cold-hearted female executive to the soft-hearted girlfriend of the main criminal character. However, the biggest problem with the movie is the character of the robot Chappie. When he starts to speak and commit actions, he often comes across as a robotic version of Jar Jar Binks - annoying, in other words. I know that Blomkamp was trying to show Chappie was a learning and easily manipulative artificial life form, but I think he could have portrayed this in a less sledgehammer style. Despite flaws like those, the movie does deliver in some areas. The special effects are very good for the most part; you'll really feel that Chappie is a true mechanical yet living object. The action sequences have some genuine excitement. And while the movie runs two hours in length, there are no slow or boring parts; the movie really zips along. The verdict? Well, as I said, there are some severe flaws in the movie, but I don't think it's downright terrible. I would recommend you wait to watch the movie when you are in an uncritical mood and have the opportunity to see it for free, as I did.very enjoyable Johannesburg Police are using robots called scouts, supplied by Tetravaal Corporation. Software engineer Deon develops a self-aware artificial intelligence which he smuggles into a defunct robot. This childlike ‚Äì but learning - being ends up kidnapped by a group of petty gangsters who plan to use it for criminal purposes. Meanwhile, back at Tetravaal, ex-military man Vincent Moore is championing an enormous and viciously militaristic robot as the next step in robotic law enforcement. Chappie is like Robocop crossed with Pinocchio, with a touch of Terminator and Pygmalion thrown in, and all run through a pronounced Saath Efrikan filter. Much is very good ‚Äì lots goes on, performances are very good, effects are great (I suspect Chappie himself is a mixture of CGI, costume, animatronic and puppetry, but they are all mixed together so well that you simply accept his physical reality throughout. It is often very funny, sometimes very touching, and has an ending ‚Äì several endings ‚Äì which I didn't see coming, and which I very much liked. Less positively, the strongly South African setting is both understandable and reasonable, but I found it somewhat distracting, the Vodacom tower product placement was annoying, the physical appearance affected by Yolandi (which, I understand, is part of her schtick) was profoundly irritating, and Moore's descent into psychotic body-shredding scenery-chewing mode was somewhere between improbable and unbelievable. On the whole, though, this was an enjoyable romp.In CHAPPiE, Sony Corporation imagines a world . . . . . . in which human beings ditch their bodies for Sony machines, so Earth becomes exclusively of The Sony, by The Sony, and for The Sony. CHAPPiE implies that any biological humans unwilling to jump on its asexual bandwagon will be dealt with harshly, along the lines of Hugh Jackman's character here, "Vincent." Sony is rooted in Japanese Culture. Still sore at losing WWII against the United States, they've been getting away with assaulting America with one Trojan Horse after another for years. They figure most of us are too dumb or apathetic to realize what they're doing. The not-so-subliminal message from CHAPPiE to its U.S. game-boy target audience (that is, the keepers of America's gene pool) seems to be, "Hey, who needs sex, just play your video games until it's time to upload your soul into that Great Arcade in the Sky with a cool new Sony product!" CHAPPiE is a warning shot across our bow. If you choose to do nothing, don't be surprised to find Junior's lifeless body in his gaming chair someday soon, his soul uploaded into and belonging to Sony and their latest gaming device.More science-fiction that inserts the necessary emotions to make a terrific outcome "Chappie" transports us into the near future, where the high crime rate in Johannesburg, South Africa calls for the acquisition of a series of armor-plated, artificially intelligent, humanoid robots that serve as the town's indestructible police force. The robots cannot be hacked and are trained to shoot, arrest, and detain law-breaking citizens. The robot's designer Deon Wilson (Dev Patel), a young and successful engineer, is detested by another engineer by the name of Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman), who's own plan for a robotic police force under the name of "MOOSE" failed when Deon's robots were brought into the market, due to the enormous size and scope of his own creation. Deon is now working on creating a robot that has a consciousness and can think and feel like a real human being. One day, Deon is kidnapped by a group of gangsters, Ninja (Ninja), Yolandi (Yolandi Visser), and Yankie (Jose Pablo Cantillo), who want the fictional "remote" for Deon's robots in order to shut down the robotic police force. When Deon informs them no such device exists, he gives them the prototype of the robot he's working on, equipped with a sound consciousness and human feelings. The gangsters agree to have Deon make infrequent trips back to their lair so he can train the robot, but the ultimate goal for the thieves is to use the robot to assist in heists and petty crime. The robot is named "Chappie," and due to it actually having the ability to think and feel, it needs to be taught like a child the very basics of life. The film shows the four attempting to train the robot and the constant game of tug of war Deon plays with the three goons, which keeps pulling Chappie back and forth between a life of good and morality and a life of violence and destruction. Now with three films under his belt not only establishing his affinity for science-fiction but his love for dystopian worlds that, he claims, take place only "ten minutes in the future," director Neill Blomkamp has affirmed with "District 9" and now with "Chappie" ("Elysium," to this day, is unseen by me) that he can make a science-fiction film with commentary, humor, entertainment, and, most surprisingly of all, a soul. "Chappie" may be a hot mess of a film, throwing together silly comedy with grotesque violence, action, suspense, and futuristic drama, but it's a hot mess that shows other disastrous cinematic hot messes how it's done. Being that the film revolves around training a robot how to live, survive, and learn the basics of existence, it's only logical that a film about the sorts be filled with so many different genres, and writer/director Blomkamp (along with co-writer Terri Tatchell) handle almost everything effectively. In addition to having an intriguing paradigm of humanity and technology coexisting when one is surpassing the other in terms of efficiency, Blomkamp also offers a real emotional core to the film's characters and character relationships, particularly that of Deon and Chappie. The two form such a strong, sensitive relationship with one another, despite being burdened by such a colossal danger with gang involvement, that the two carry out one of the most tender portrayals of a human's friendship with a humanoid that I have yet to see. While a devoted team of visual effects workers definitely have "Chappie" covered in a sense that it can be a visual spectacle, with the action scenes remaining clear and vibrant rather than muddled and incoherent most of the time, it's Blomkamp who surprises with his ability to evoke human sensibilities into a story I feared would lose it all in the shuffle of slambang action. To digress just a bit, "Chappie"'s marketing was something of a spectacle in itself. When trailers first surfaced, they didn't portray the film's ideas adequately, rushing to show glimpses of the more suspenseful moments in the film to hopefully gain the widest possible audience. The first poster, showing Chappie decked out in bling and surrounded by children's building blocks, looked almost as if this were a silly kids film. When the second trailer of "Chappie" premiered, which I had the pleasure of seeing at least a dozen times since the beginning of this year, seemed to hit the nail on the head, portraying the man vs. machine conflict in a much greater manner. Finally, "Chappie" was awarded a much-deserved R-rating from the MPAA, which helped finally solidify some good spirits about the film from me, seeing as it took its idea all the way and exercised its full ability to be creative and gritty. The film is a winning blend of several genres, and should be look onto by those who wouldn't venture out to see such films of the like. Science-fiction fans will likely appreciate it, but, being someone who doesn't normally embrace these kinds of films with open arms and glowing praise, I feel the market who has long felt themselves rundown by the ubiquity of these kinds of films will see the merit and value in a film like this (the kind "Kingsman: The Secret Service" will most likely bring to someone who has grown weary and fatigued by the onslaught of superhero films). Not only does "Chappie" provide some hope for original science-fiction in the near future, it also provides for diversity in multiplexes and a more attractiveness to those who feel outside of the loop on the majority of the particular releases of this genre.An Interesting Idea, Made Into A Decent Film! Based on Neill Blomkamp's 2004 short film Tetra Vaal, 'Chappie' is An Interesting Idea, Made Into A Decent Film! I loved the concept &amp; also some of its strikingly done graphics, but, the Writing leaves something to be desired. Better Writing was needed, to enhance the overall impact! 'Chappie' Synopsis: In the near future, crime is patrolled by a mechanized police force. When one police droid, Chappie, is stolen and given new programming, he becomes the first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself. 'Chappie' takes a look at a future, that's bleak but also interesting. Blomkamp &amp; Terri Tatchell's Screenplay is superbly innovative &amp; offers some terrific moments. The bonding/rivalry of its human characters with the A.I robots is interesting to watch. I also loved Chappie's characterization. But, the Writing slips at times. The second-hour, in particular, loses steam &amp; the climax needed to be sharper. The Writing isn't as sharp as its concept &amp; that too an extend, disappoints.  Blomkamp's Direction is impressive. He's handled some of the most intense sequences, aptly. Cinematography is perpetually focused. Editing is slightly loose, especially in the second-hour. The Graphics &amp; The Action-Sequences are mind-blowing. Art &amp; Costume Design are detailed. Hans Zimmer's Score is brilliant. Performance-Wise: Sharlto Copley as Chappie, is stupendous, delivering a strong voice &amp; motion capture performance. Dev Patel is in terrific form. He's done very well. Ninja, Yolandi Visser &amp; Jose Pablo Cantillo are adequate. Hugh Jackman hams. Sigourney Weaver is wasted.  On the whole, 'Chappie' has its share of highs of lows. Not Perfect, but Not Bad either!Chappie After having impressed me with the excellent film District 9, director Neill Blomkamp disappointed me a bit with Elysium, which had some audacious ideas, but didn't have a very consistent screenplay. And, for better or for worse, the same can be said about Chappie, whose ambitious science fiction premise is dotted by some questionable decision and changes of tone which end up clouding the virtues of the film a bit. Nevertheless, I liked it, even though it's far from reaching the high standard established by District 9. Chappie basically starts like Robocop (seriously, even the voice of robot-cops is very similar to Peter Weller's), then becomes Short Circuit and ends like Iron Man, taking some deviations through the territory of Aut√≥mata, Bicentennial Man and even Transformers. All this is an indicator that there isn't too much originality in the screenplay of Chappie; but Blomkamp displays an undeniable talent to create intense and energetic scenes, without losing of sight the integrity of the (imperfect) story. His handling of the special effects is as good as it has ever been, combining exciting action sequences with inflexible realism during the most relaxed and personal moments of the story. I think the robot Chappie is on par with the best "synthetic actors", such as Gollum and Caesar, expressing life and emotion with such a detail that we immediately forget its digital nature; it just ends up being another character, and not a complex special effect. An excellent work from the studios Image Engine Design and Weta, and actor Sharlto Copley, who brought his voice and body language to Chappie. On the negative side, we have the various weaknesses from the screenplay. Chappie's ethical dilemma had a big potential due to the strong contrast between the humanist ideals from its creator and the lost instincts from the criminals who kidnap it. Unfortunately, the robot's intellectual exploration is reduced to "cute" moments in which it has to learn to be "gangsta cool", walking, talking and using "bling" like its captors. During these scenes, Chappie gets dangerously close to the ethnic "funny" robots from Transformers, with the same irritating effect. Besides, it was difficult for me to take the caricature criminals seriously, and on top of that, rappers Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser bring atrocious performances in those roles. But that's not all. The screenplay is dotted by small traps and inconsistent moments which ruin the credibility. I prefer not to give examples because they would be spoilers, but they are quite obvious. And finally, we have the unnecessary character played by Hugh Jackman (with a horrible hair- cut, by the way) as obligatory military- corporative villain who wants to ruin everything for economical reasons. That character is absolutely useless... except as an easy enemy during the final battle, which is very well shot but isn't very justified from the narrative point of view (I don't think this is a spoiler, because from his first appearance, we know where this uni-dimensional character is heading). In conclusion, Chappie didn't leave me completely satisfied, but it kept me entertained, and I can give it a moderate recommendation because of that. I think the recent film Aut√≥mata made a better work as provocative and intelligent science fiction about the future of artificial intelligence, despite not having been made with as many resources as Chappie. Regarding Blomkamp, I keep thinking he's a talented director, but in his next films, he should work with screenwriters with a better criterion about the structure of the stories. Otherwise, he will continue the downward spiral in his next projects, and we don't need another M. Night Shyamalan.Basic but fun Johannesburg, South Africa. In order to curb the high crime rate the police use robots to fight crime. This is an immediate success and the police order several more robots from the developer, Tetravaal. After falling foul of these robots, two criminals, Ninja and Yolandi, kidnap Tetravaal's chief engineer, and genius behind the robots, Deon Wilson, with the aim of getting him to deactivate them. To their surprise he is transporting one of the robots, Scout 22, as he is working on a personal project to give robots consciousness. Ninja and Yolandi see the opportunity to have a robot on their side and immediately set about attempting to train the robot to help them in their criminal activities. They also give him a name - Chappie. Okay, fun movie from writer-director Neil Blomkamp. Not anywhere up to the standard of Blomkamp's brilliant debut movie, District 9, but it'll do (and it is heaps better than Blomkamp's second movie, the weak, irritating Elysium).  Pretty basic plot with low production values and a hammy clumsiness to it all, yet it is fairly entertaining. Maybe it is the crudeness of it all that makes it likable, as it is difficult to take too seriously.  Add in two of the most colourful criminals of all time - Ninja and Yolandi, played by the members of South African rap band Die Antwoord, and it is a rollicking ride. Does get a bit silly towards the end as the capers get to be like a common-or-garden action movie. Also loses its lightness as Blomkamp tries to be serious and inject some philosophy and emotion into the movie, and this is out of place and half-baked. Overall, hardly Citizen Kane but reasonably entertaining.Not very original Despite this movie involving a robot with a consciousness. I found this movie to be quite boring and lacked the depth and humanity it needed to make it work. "Chappie" is a very simple story about a robot that is one of a kind that has his own consciousness. And how he gets brought up from a group of hoodlum gang (they aren't really that bad or sadistic or anything like that just a little messed up in the head). Anyways majority of the movie is Chappie the robot with a consciousness stealing and going on robberies, because it just doesn't know any better because of what he learned from the group of people that taught him. I thought this was going to be a movie that dove into the philosophy of robotics a bit and that it would do a good job of putting the audience through the mindset of a robot. With ideals of robotics and morals being tested and such. With Chappie being caught in the middle and playing a big part in the clash. Even though it goes in a direction where it's about a robot with a consciousness learning from his environment and the people around him. It just seemed like it could have been done better with more heart and creativity to it. But it just didn't have any real elements that even tugged on the heartstrings. The main reason that got my interest when it came to the trailer was that it has Hugh Jackman in it. And I absolutely loved the movie "Real Steel" which he was in. This movie is just nowhere as good. I think the director Neill Blomkamp is very resourceful seeing what he was able to accomplish with the budget for "District 9". And so I guess I am mostly impressed with the what this movie accomplished with it's budget, especially when it comes to the special effects applied to Chappie. However overall this is a forgettable movie, which is only somewhat saved by it having Hugh Jackman in it, but even he didn't really seem to care all that much. It just isn't all that original of a film when it comes to the design to the story which is sort of like a robot version of "Oliver Twist" with the design being similar to "Appleseed" the manga/anime. 4.8/10Chappie Has a Voice "Chappie" isn't perfect, but the bottom line is, no one but Neill Blomkamp could've made this film.  The picture has a singular voice, manifests a unique view of the world. It's funny, bizarre, ridiculous, idiosyncratic, compelling. It's also very touching. "Chappie" expresses itself, rather than caters to audience expectations. Isn't that the point of art/entertainment? If you wanna dig, there are also some really interesting things going on here thematically - the film presents a society in which the government's response to destitution is an iron fist, which provokes violence from the population. This in turn provokes an even harsher reaction from the government.  So look at Chappie the character. He is given the choice to turn to violence or benevolence - different role models teach him with different ways of living. In the end, even though he gives in to violence and anger when his mother is killed, he forgives her killer (in a hilarious moment) and in the end chooses benevolence.shame on you for giving low rating Well i rate this movie 10 out of 10 bcoz it deserve this rating. The acting was very well done .the story writing is well done Everything is best in the movie except one thing which is rating .why people are giving rating so bad . Why avanger the age of ultron, fast and furious 7 and transfer like childish movie get the better review. My blood get boiled when i saw the avanger and fast and furious 7 get more than 8 rating . are people really so dumb. Specially the people of India all they like is fighting and action and dishum dishum.  The movie must contains something unique like chappie or interstellar. My only suggestion to everyone is stop believing in fake markating and decide yourself and give the honest review. Summary: The movie is about near future where robot work as cop but one engineer make a full artificial intelligence robot who can think and has emotions . But thing goes wrong The ending is amazing and very mind shaking when chappie the robot transfer the consciousness .i am not gonna spoil it Check by yourself.Amazing movie full of heart, a must see. I am very surprised by the negative reviews of this movie. It is one of the most amazing and warm stories ever portrayed on the big screen. The characters are vivid, the setting is real, the story works and Chappie is singular. The director has outdone himself, this movie is even better than District 9, and I loved that one. Chappie is something rare and special, innocent and with endless possibilities ahead of him, yet he is plunged into the abyss of human relationships, strife, crime and, occasionally - hope. He has to learn, grow and adapt if he is to survive. The movie is full of heart, touching, and it empowers you to forget Chappie is all metal. His fears are real and he can love. His character arc is amazing to witness, with his limitations relentlessly forcing him to maturity. I loved the movie, saw it twice and going to see it a third time this weekend. Ignore the critics. Go see for yourself.Underrated Movie of The Century My husband and I went into the theater with low expectations, having heard very little about the film before we decided to see it. By serendipitous chance we stumbled upon a pure work of genius. Chappie is the movie equivalent of refined gold that so many before have tried and failed to be. Director Neill Blomkamp has done it again, and in our opinion his finest work. Die Antwood is an interesting choice, one that I think really paid off. If you have any level of knowledge about Johannesburg then the characters make perfect sense. The character Chappie himself has been created by Blomkamp in such a beautifully human and relatable way that one can't help but feel deeply for him as he faces a cruel world. 10/10Chappie is wonderful movie from the genius behind District 9 Don't let those reviewers over at meta-critic fool you, this movie is wonderfully done with colourful characters and a wonderful atmosphere. The characters in this movie have rich emotion to go with each of them from beginning to end, especially Chappie who you see change throughout the entire movie. He goes from an innocent robot who doesn't like hurting people to basically the Terminator. But it's not an instant change as you see this robot's opinion and attitude change towards the end of the movie. And if you want a good laugh this movie has plenty of funny moments for you to enjoy. Especially the moments in the movie when Chappie learns how to swear from his 'Daddy' Ninja. However this wouldn't be a Neill Blomkamp without some sad parts either. There's a scene in a movie that, although Chappie was a former police robot that some though near indestructible. You get to see his vulnerability in a scene in which Chappie is dropped off by a group of hood rats who obviously don't like the police. So the proceed to beat him with objects like rock or lead pipes, all the while he is begging for the to stop. Eventually they go so far to even start him on fire which is very sad as he repeats that he just wants to go home. Shortly after that he is abducted by his maker's 'rival' in order to get a chip from his head, but since his rival is jealous he decided to have him killed. They worst they did to him was take his left arm off. When he finally gets home he is greeted by his human 'mother' who sees his injuries and berates Ninja for letting him go. This is a very emotional series of events and reveals to the audience that although Chappie could definitely kill anyone, he's kind hearted and refuses to do so.This film is amazing Although low budget with some unknown actors it's brilliantly executed and very well acted by Sharlto Copley who manages to inject more humanity into his performance as a robot than most actors playing human.  The story line, while fairly predictable is entertaining and the character arc of each of the characters very well done. Characters that are unlikeable at the beginning become someone you care about Hugh Jackman's performance is a little featureless but his casting is good - outside of his usual macho action hero role to someone is weak and selfish I found this very emotionally gripping and I'm looking forward to watching it again8 out of 10 kinda deal but rounding up to offset the ravers This is my second time watching this film; the first time being when it came out. That right there tells you something, it's good. This is the third in the Neil Blomkamp "future trilogy", and possibly the best depending on your tastes. I think this is my favorite, Elysium would have been my favorite if it wasn't for the horrible acting from the mother/girlfriend opposite Matt Damon. Anyway, I digress. This film is set in a not too distant future and is about a lone engineer who wrote a program for artificial intelligence and puts it into the body of a damaged humanoid police drone in the backset of being held in the custody of a few lifetime criminals. This film is a masterpiece. People like to complain about the acting by the South African rappers Blomkamp put in the lead roles, they basically play themselves; in other words they nail it. The only minor complaint I have is they overuse the rap couple's music a little too much. Anyway, the ending takes a twisted and uncomfortable turn. I don't agree with the moral ramifications of uploading your consciousness into a computer for the purpose of living forever but the question needs to be asked. Because there are some freaks out there pushing for this kind of stuff and it is scary. Just imagine a dictator doing this and living forever and causing pain and misery for hundreds of years. Scary times ahead, ha. Anyway this is a great film. It also covers the topic of nature vs nurture. And a bunch of other things. Many people hate on this film because they do not agree with the themes. Regardless, the film is interesting, paced very well and above all it is entertaining. I highly recommend this film. Sci-fi at its best.A more-than-fantastic movie This is a more-than-fantastic movie, one of the best sci-fi ones since District 9 (2009), which is by the same director. It has a brilliant plot, an amazing cast, awesome visual effects, beautiful emotions, heart-breaking events, and hilarious moments too. Definitely a must-watch. I especially love the way Chappie's ears express his feelings. I've watched many on-screen robots and he's one of the cutest. It would have been great if Amerika didn't die, I like him a lot. As for the other members of the gang at the end, I think they will have to find a way to fix the issue of irreplaceable and uncharged batteries, which is a really illogical point though.the best of Neill so far in 2015 or the best film I've seen in 2015 I just finished watching this feature film in Clifton, New Jersey at an IMAX theater and I have to say it was so epic that it left some people crying because the main protagonist had so much passion and courage to think and to fight like a human being child. The tickets costs came out to $17.62 and was so worth it and I don't regret wasting my money into this film. I'm so happy that more movies like this is being produced this year and bringing back modern sic-fi features. Neill Blomkamp did an amazing job as a director and a screenwriter. When I saw Hans Zimmer at the end of the credits as a music composer, I was shocked, I said to myself, the soundtrack on this film was phenomenal. This film is the best hands down of the year, so far, even if it is still March, lol. I can't wait for another Neill Blomkamp film to be produced in the near future.Great movie definitely worth watching I find Chappie is an excellent movie. It is very rich in different ways, from the wide range of emotions generated in the viewer, to the action packed sequences taking place in a hip, colourful, environment. Chappie, being a robot, seems to cause discomfort to certain, causing them to even go as much as calling him annoying. It all depends on what you're in for as an experience, but him going through different phases, and mostly, being even possible through a plot that seems, let's not argue about the plausibility, but certainly quite enjoyable makes it all an entertaining story, and a refreshing perspective. Him going through innocence (Rousseau reference - good), life and its challenges, while learning what "Being yourself", "Trust" and "Live" mean, and then on the other hand; "Lying", "Mean" and "Dying" and their devastating effects, in an environment being volatile between narcotics and a child's amazement could actually make you think of certain aspects¬Öthe importance of being true to yourself and what you desire. The movie strokes multiple times the consciousness subject through its different facets, and does a good job at it. There's an interest take on how it could be stored¬Ö You get numerous laughs pertaining to modernity's characteristics, 2 automobile acronyms that matter, and then you get deep discussions from some of the characters you would least expect. Isn't that original? There are some nice references to realizing the self, the importance of good deeds; the afterlife¬Öthe same refutation that can't handle these subjects is that which makes the good struggle in the movie, in a very nice and artistic depiction. Then there's Hans Zimmer's name on the score¬Ö I'd take that as a story any time, rather than drift aloof in a constant atmosphere of molestation. I don't read critics, but from what I've seen so far, they're very good at keeping it at a very simplistic level, what a sad outlook. Guess what? That's how creativity dies. At some point it gets really appealing to quickly see what another says, encompassed by routine, it comes up to being time efficient. If you don't believe it could be interesting¬Öyou don't have to go watch it. No one is forcing your eyes to open up on something else¬Öbut if on the other hand you believe it could be appealing to you, you should go. Its message is beautifully transmitted to us, or more like brought back to us. It is the third movie by Blomkamp that I really enjoyed.FRESH and Stylish SCI-FI flick! Watched OVER AND OVER! I don't normally do reviews, but this movie was one in a million. It had great characters, that were not only interesting and funny, they had a certain authentic quality that really made you feel for them, as they drew you into their world. The characters didn't force you to like, or find them funny- it just happened- as they naturally were captivating and magnetic people. The acting debut of Die Antwoord's Ninja and Yolandi Vissar was superb. They gave this movie it's beautiful, funky and tough "zef" style, and really held their own as actors. They added a unique "realness" that you normally wouldn't get with a "real" actor. I didn't even know they weren't "actors" before watching this movie. Chappie, the robot, was also very believable as a just-born sentient being. It was hilarious to watch him try to "fit-in" with the gang. On the whole this movie was great. Being a post-apocalyptic movie, I would've normally liked to see a bigger story line, but with how the director kept the attention on this small group of people, (as well as the events that get unfolded, and their consequential effects), it really allowed you to get swallowed up by their world, and experience this crazy world as if you were there. It wasn't exactly an action-packed sci-fi film, (which I liked for a change), but it did draw you into the story through humor, style, character, and love. One of the brilliant things about this movie, (as all of Blomkamp's movies), was the post-apocalyptic style in the setting. It's unique, and the use of color in such a dismal world is amazing. I realize in this film, Die Antwoord's Ninja and Yolandi brought a lot of their own style to this movie as well, and the combination of styles, (w/ Blomkamp's) was perfect!  I have watched this movie over and over. I almost didn't even see it at first, (thinking it was just another "stupid robot movie"). I am so glad I did!Un-artificial un-intelligence that lowers your IQ by 100 I can't pick less than 1 star so let's give 6 to Zimmer for the music and that leaves minus 5 for the rest of the work. I did see many bad films, being stupid becomes quite the norm lately. But this one just keeps insulting your mind with new and new things every few minutes. Nothing makes the slightest sense throughout the 2 hours. The few minutes of actually good footage were all shown in the trailer so do yourself a favor, save your time and money. I'm pretty sad about the director's trend: a mediocre-but-okay D9 (not deserving the hype), pretty-bad Elysium followed by this horrible mess. And on the horizon the next contract is Alien 5? Sigh. That would deserve better. Btw yet more proof that you can add whatever good actors (and effects), it will not save the day.Fell Asleep Half-Way Through I really wanted to enjoy this movie, and I might have done, if I was 4 years old, with an IQ comparable to that of a gherkin!  I knew within the first 5 minutes that this was going to be one of the worst movies I'd ever seen, and I wasn't wrong. It was so bad that I fell asleep about half way through, and I have no intention of watching the remainder. Is Hugh Jackman really so desperate for work that he sullied his name with this garbage?!?!  On another note, can somebody tell me where I sign up to get paid to write glowing reviews for crap movies?  Save your money and spend it on something worthwhile... like dehydrated water.Money and Time both wasted.. Worst movie of the year, weak plot, poor acting and how did even Hugh Jackman sign up for a movie like this?. It seems as if director is a little kid playing with his toys and doing whatever he likes to do with it. I Will never recommend it to anyone. From the very beginning movie seemed to have no story at all. Casting Die Antwood as "thugs" was the worst part of the movie. Graphics were okay but flawed plot ruined everything. I can go on and write a whole on this worthless movie but in short this movie makers made it sure that people will watch less sci-fi after watching "Chappie"!!. Total waste of time and money as well.If there was a rating lower than 0 this movie would earn it. Wow. That was the most annoyingly idiotic movie involving robots I have ever seen and I wish I was joking. Where do I start. Seriously. I mean come on. If a robot running around calling people mommy/daddy, shooting guns and spurting idiocy trying to go gangster then transferring consciousnesses into other robots is their idea of how to entertain an audience for two whole bloody hours, they must be nuts. The script. The storyline. Everything was just ridiculous. and just cause the antagonist was a former soldier, they had to make him this sadistic war freak? and the other characters made no sense at all. all the scenes were shot warehouse-office-warehouse-office-ghetto-street- warehouse. oh joy. I just couldn't believe people actually came out to watch this...this garbage. Such a waste of Dev Patel and Hugh Jackman. they were pretty good but I couldn't WAIT for it to end. Well that's two hours of my life i'll never have again and it makes me so mad I actually logged into IMDb just to say it.so the movie sucked lets talk about Hugh Jackmans ass since its the only thing that made the POS watchable Story sucked, acting sucked now if only Hugh would suck... but he doesn't. Watched it twice first time I was high and I thought maybe I should watch it sober and give it an honest chance WRONG its much better when your high so you can find its stupidity, lack of originality, bad directing and don't even get me going on the writing. I did end up with a good reason to fall of the sofa in laughter but was this a comedy? About the director Im not going to even start on this no talent sorry excuse for someone that has the balls to think he's a director, not one of his movies have I found the least bit enjoyable. My opinion, he must be sleeping with someone and he must have a huge cock, because talent he is far from having... avoid this POSThis film was total trash!! And not in the "fun" kind of way either... I've watched some bad movies in my time... heck, I'm a major fan of B-Cinema and the like usually. But this film... From it's logic, full of holes, to it's acting and more... was just terrible! Never have I so happily been cheering that the main characters get killed. I mean, what were they (the filmmakers) trying to convey? Why did they want you to cheer for the thugs? And I mean thugs! Ninja and the group... terrible! This film was just, total trash from beginning to end. And the entire concept was trash. Have you gotten my point yet that I think this film was trash? I couldn't even finish the damn film first time through because it just lost my interest within the first 30 minutes. I got to about the half way point (about an hour and 10 minutes or so) into the film, but then had to stop it and watch something else before returning to it. The only redeeming factor from the whole film is you feel bad for the robot, Chappie, and the special effects are pretty damn cool. But that's not enough for a film to be watchable or enjoyable. I mean, even Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver couldn't save this stink bomb of a film! So, in short, avoid this film! It quite possibly may lower your IQ, or give you cancer. Okay, maybe neither will happen, but you get the point.Just terrible... I was expecting so much from this director after "District 9"...and ...everything went wrong...after that, just have a lot of premium special effects...and terrible scripts...and can even make good actors turn bad... this is a childish movie with a terrible plot, bad story...and it's just like a big videoclip for band "Die antwoord" ... just another terrible teenager band...and wow...they are the (bad) main characters there...this is the end of the promise director Neill Blomkamp... after this...please...just make stupid videoclips for teenage bands... the only thing it's really great it's the 3d CGI...just that... just a waist of time...Catering to the lowest common denominator Disastrous. Juvenile. Insulting. Three words that perfectly describe the latest offering from Neill Blomkamp, three words that would not have been expected to describe a film directed by this man. Blomkamp is best known for the absolutely brilliant "District 9," a reflection on apartheid, but also responsible for the almost equally fascinating "Elysium," which was a sci-fi look at the ongoing 1% debate. So, expectations for his third feature, "Chappie," were understandably considerably high. However, the expectations are sadly unfounded as this film does not even remotely live up to expectation. In fact, it doesn't live up to anything. At all. In short, "Chappie" is the story of a "broken" robot from a fleet of robot police now protecting Johannesburg, which gets rebooted by fully self-sufficient artificial intelligence installed by the developer of the police robots, Deon Wilson (Dev Patel, "Slumdog Millionaire"). Having been "kidnapped" by a ridiculous gang of wannabe "gangstas," played absolutely horrifically by members of South African rap group Die Antwoord (Ninja, Yo-Landi Visser), with absolutely no acting ability whatsoever, Chappie, which needs to learn from scratch like a baby, is "raised" by these bumbling idiots to help them pull off a huge heist. After screwing up a drug deal for Hippo, one of the few worthwhile characters in the film played with brilliant, anarchic, shirtless hotness by Brandon Auret, Ninja and Yolandi owe him $20 million. And they have a week to get it to him. And thus, this film then wants you to believe, without actually showing you how it is actually accomplished, that this robot named Chappie, in the hands of idiotic, failed gangsters and with limited input from the wasted Dev Patel, could go from zero and baby-like to an almost full-fledged, heist-worthy "adult"¬Öin about a week. Because "gangstas" would have time for this. All the while, teaching him to "act gangsta," making the film a complete joke while practically verging on racist gansgta clich√©s¬Ödiving head first into a pool of utter ridiculousness. With its amateur soundtrack, its "gangsta" stupidity, its horrific acting, complete lack of logical narrative and deflection of all its shortcomings through the use of explosions, this film truly caters to the absolute lowest common denominator. In fact, it expects its audience to be so truly uneducated, when Hippo speaks, the film features English subtitles. Um, Hippo speaks English. This film was so dumb, and assumed its audience would be so uneducated, they put English subtitles under a guy speaking English. The film, in all its stupidity, actually manages to directly insult the intelligence of its audience. So, where do big names Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver fit into this? Jackman plays Vincent Moore, a spoiled brat with a horrific haircut who designed a similar type of police robot which was deemed far too big and expensive to be used, so he devises a plan to knock out Wilson's robots so his will be implemented. Weaver merely plays Wilson and Moore's boss at the company which created these droids. Why they wanted to be involved in this film is beyond me. So, listen to me when I say, avoid this film at all costs. Unlike the strong, important political messages of his first two films, on his third outing, Blomkamp has achieved absolutely nothing but creating a film that wants to show an audience just what an epic failure looks like. If Chappie was humanity's last hope, may a god help us all.Overall the worst movie I have ever seen I take no pleasure in writing a negative review. I'd much rather rave about a movie that pleasantly surprised me. In the movie, Tropic Thunder, the term "full retard" became a trendy catch-phrase. I don't want to sound like a whiny, semi-literate malcontent, but while sitting through this absolute bomb of a movie, the one recurring phrase that kept passing through my mind was, "they went full retard." Chappie, the robot, gains sentience. He can think for himself, though he starts out like a child that must be taught everything. This is the core of the movie. Clearly, the writers meant to create a sweet metaphor about the tribulations of growing up, but what they created was two hours of pure cinematic torture. The acting, plot, and action sequences were often cringe inducing, not to mention laughably illogical and ridiculous. I seriously can't imagine how anyone could enjoy this movie. Chappie is taught by Johannesburg gangsters, who talk about as authentically as Keanu Reeves accent in Dracula (read: abominably). This was one of the most irritating parts of the movie, but add to this the cartoonish, buffoonish characters and the whole thing was simply a misguided mess. After one hour I didn't think I could last till the end. I literally couldn't even sit still in my seat, but I toughed it out, hoping something at the end would happen to redeem the movie. Sadly, it did not. I won't even bother writing about the plot. It's full of holes. The acting is generally so absurd it goes beyond intentional satire. I pity the great actress Sigourney Weaver who somehow got roped into this mess. But most of all, I pity everyone who sat through this movie.Entertaining BUT .. a modern cheesy Australian Robocop Clearly Chappie is a modern day Robocop. They ripped off the story line. Weapons\Security maker that makes robots to police the streets. They copied the prototype police force. Robocop .. then they copied the overkill police response in the Moose robots .. Really? You know .. the one in the scene from Robocop that shoots the business geek to death during the That unimaginative? They tried to dress up the movie with the philosophical crap of "What is consciousness" (Ghost in the machine) .. "We can transfer consciousness" from one machine to another. Weak. That this movie is a 7 rating as of 8/13/15 is a joke. Jackman and Weaver must have been paid all of the $49 million budget because there was little creative thought put into this movie.
Genuinely Terrible I will preface this by saying that I have not read the books. I did see the first movie and actually enjoyed it. I usually watch movies such as this with a skeptic mind and the first one wasn't bad. This movie, however, was terrible. (Heavy spoilers roasting over an open fire to follow) I've heard that the movie deviates almost unforgivably from the book. If that's the case, I can't speak for the book but the movie script looks to have been written by a high-schooler, at best.  The movie is riddled with clich√©s: Main character with a dark inner battle raging due to prior decisions made (boring!). People (and armies) showing up just at the perfect time (forgivable once, not around the 5th time). Bad guys who couldn't hit a target 20 feet in front of them while shooting an automatic weapon (man those guys suck). And the ultimate "faked death with poison/paralysis" scene (wow that whole scene was bad).  Throughout the whole movie the main character (the annoying tom-boy girl), Tris, keeps being painted as "tough" and "deadly". She is neither of these. In fact, she is quite laughably the opposite. Could her personal trainers not put her through some weight-training classes? (Her hairstylist was definitely present as her hair looked like she just stepped out of a Hollywood salon right after the scene where she cut her OWN hair with a pair of rusty scissors....) It looks like she couldn't even do 10 push ups yet she was fighting people and saving people falling over ledges with ease. But she looks like a huge wuss! Her little girly grunts and squeals she made when fighting or doing "action" made me bust out laughing. And the scene where she breaks through the glass is meant to be bad-ass and instead just left me hoping she would bounce off the glass and fall flat on her back (man, I wanted to laugh so bad).  And probably the most unforgivable part of this whole movie was how POINTLESS everything was. Examples: They fight the faction-less on the train, killing several and doing serious damage to many more (not really sure how because Tris fights like a sissy girl). Then the main character, Four, says his own name and the leader of the vagabonds through bloodied teeth is like, "Oh we cool bro. Never mind you just head-butted me in the face and killed my friends." (the Hell??) (Oh and Tris's brother is a huge pussy). They continue to fight hard and kill people to narrowly escape the perfectly- uniformed drone guards of the "capital" so that they can go in to hiding. Then the main character just gives herself up. I think it was because the villain was threatening to kill innocent people with her mind control devices (never seen that before), but it doesn't really matter. Then she's given the chance to escape by her double- double crossing 'friend' (didn't see that coming) and yet she chooses to stay to open the mystery divergent box. Well what was the point of anything if you wanted to open it anyway??! I was DYING to contain my frustration. (also, how does the evil capital lady have this perfectly built divergent-box-opening proprietary chamber system, complete with bulletproof glass and mystery-box holding pedestal, just already set up? Does no one question this stuff???) And to top it all off, the super-secret, must-be-preserved-at-all- costs message in the box, (the ENTIRE point of the movie): "Divergents are cool, don't ostracize them. Oh, and the rest of humanity is living outside the wall. Cheers." What? No one has bothered to check this whole time?????? Gag. Enough roasting. To conclude, lots of movies, even good ones, have clich√©s and information that you are just supposed to assume. But this movie was genuinely terrible. Maybe all the people reviewing this with an 7/10+ saw a different movie than I did.Dull and Forgettable The word "insurgent" means to actively revolt, implying some distinctiveness that sets its participants apart from the norm. Ironically, the film Insurgent, a faded photocopy of other teen- scifi-dramas, doesn't have a single unique bone in its body. Not that it's aggressively terrible. There are some decent scifi elements and even a couple of mildly intriguing moments. But like clockwork, every slight turn for the better is quickly overwhelmed by extreme boredom. Like a forgettable SyFy channel series masquerading as a blockbuster film, Insurgent is simply a dull and uninteresting sequel. That word "sequel" should connote a progression of sorts, but no. As little as I remember about the previous entry in the Divergent Series, I can tell you this: shaky cam action scenes, bloviating about "special ones", and constant fighting for the McGuffin-of-the- week were the focus and are still in full form here. At the center is Woodley, an actress with a whole heckuva lot of talent that simply doesn't have the presence of strength to carry this sort of role. She presents a microcosm problem for an entire film full of great actors terribly miscast. Teller and Elgort manage some natural charisma and charm from their otherwise absent characters, Watts and Spencer are all but completely missing, and Winslet is just plain wasted. It's none of their fault; they just can't make the embarrassingly constant melodrama palatable. Even if it was laughably bad there might be something to cling to, but it's not bold enough to even warrant that reaction. Insurgent only serves as a lame, achingly dull placeholder until the next Hunger Games installment.Bad enough to make one doubt IMDb ratings forever Divergent was not brilliant, but it was your average young adult movie. Insurgent is way below that. It is so bad that I wanted to leave the theater and read my book. But anyway, let's talk about the movie. In the first film Tris learns she is special, in the second she learns she is *very* special, but just if her boyfriend lets her do anything. Seriously, I actually had to ask my wife if girls like guys like him or is it just the submissive fantasy of the author. Apparently, a lot of girls like overbearing assholes who think they know what is better for you. And guess who makes her appearance in the sequel? The mother in law! Bottom line: the sci-fi aspect of the film was marginal, the characters clich√©d to the point of monomolecular cardboard and the basic story was learning to accept yourself as your boyfriend tells you what to do while he deals with his mommy issues. I am not kidding: the most sympathetic character in Insurgent was Peter, the asshole who always insults and betrays everybody. P.S. The Erudite test was remembering something that had happened to you two nights ago? Really? That's what makes you smart?Messy Plot and Underutilized Great Actors 'INSURGENT' picks up shortly after the events in 'Divergent' with obvious intentions to maintain, if not, speed up the momentum of the franchise. There's no doubt how fascinating the 'Divergent' universe is, and while it shares almost the same elements that made many of the YA franchises today, successful, the movie has its own unique facets to separate itself apart. Unfortunately in Insurgent, those elements aren't effectively explored and utilized. Once again, movie makers fall prey to this mentality or should I say practice, that seems to highlight the film's visual panache, but dismisses the utmost importance of effective storytelling. I think I've gone redundant here, but to be honest, Insurgent is no different, and if you'd allow me to make this honesty, even brutal, this Divergent sequel tracks a deteriorating trajectory, and you can imagine how the franchise is set to get even worse, knowing the last book of the trilogy is going to be split into two movies. This doesn't surprise me at all, given the fact how film makers has been consistently regarding these popular franchises as merely cash cows. In Insurgent, the plot thickens, and not just that, it branches out to several sub ones. That's when the film begins losing its grip around the central story, giving way to subplots that don't make sense at all, if not barely. As she searches for allies, crossing one faction's territony to another's, our titular heroine, Tris, finds herself in a cat-and-mouse chase with the enemy, in this case, Jeanine (Kate Winslet)‚Äîa name that Veronically Roth seems to suggest to be perfect for a character she molds as a super-villainess that embodies terror (am I being sarcastic? of course I....am. Lol..)‚Äîand her loyal erudite followers. Tris maintains reluctance, but when Jeanine turns toward her loved ones, our heroine succumbs and surrenders herself to the enemy. (this is so new). INSURGENT draws in more actors on its payroll to play new characters, but barely utilizes them up to their full capacity. In the end, it's Shailene Woodley that mostly does her job as the central character. On the film's key moments, she undoubtedly shines, only her efforts aren't enough to place the movie's charm to the same level as hers. No thanks to the chemistry the film seems to suggest Four and Tris have, because I don't think I felt it‚Äîit was missing. The action sequences are well played, I must say, and the visual effects borders extravagance, but against a weak and unfocused narrative, INSURGENT is a film you better just wait to come out on DVD, instead, and not one to waste time and money on. (not unless you're planning to critique it the same I do)Terribly Disappointing Loved the first Divergent movie. Then read all the books and thought Neil Burger did a great job turning the first book into an accurate and entertaining film. I was so sad to know he was not directing Insurgent. And after seeing Insurgent, that sadness was justified. Robert Schawkle or whatever his name is did an awful job making the 2nd book into a movie. The 2nd book was lamer than the first, but it had a much easier plot to deal with. This movie strayed so far from the story in the book, title should be Insurgent Undone. They even had a bigger budget for this film, yet made it shorter in length, cramming scenes in with minimal creativity and almost zero character development. Almost everything that occurs is not true to the narrative in the book. Johanna appears to have no scars on her face and she's fat, wtf. The entire villain of Jeanine is tarnished by a completely different take on her motives. Book readers of this story should not watch the film nor appreciate its utter suckiness. Did the director even glance at the book? Did Veronica Roth really approve this movie? I am appalled?A Disney dystopia, what rubbish There's nothing more annoying than a movie that sets itself in a dystopia and then has a bunch of pretty people running around doing unbelievable things. Maybe if I was a third grader I would appreciate this fantasy but as an adult it was torture to watch. This movie would need some serious surgery to actually pass as something I could make all the way through. I didn't make it all the way through by the way. The casting, direction and writing would all have to be redone. Basically, throw it all out and start over. Otherwise, this could possibly work as a Yahoo TV movie. File this one in the folder of movies that think the audience is dumb and will just be wow'd by ridiculous action and young heroes. So annoying and such a waste of my time.Do you have 119 minutes to waste? On what grounds does this movie have 6,9 rating on IMDb? This insults the intelligence. Shailene Woodley has no character and acts like she is first time in front of the camera. Action is meaningless. This is what happens when you run out of ideas. 45 minutes before the end I wanted to quit, but...I did not do it. Why? Because I had hoped it will improve, and then... nothing. This is the most honest opinion about this movie that I was able to give you. Now, I'm asking you, do you have 119 minutes of your life to waste? Oh what, you do not believe me? No problem! Just remember what I told you and come back after you watch this piece of abomination. As regards of Kate Winslet, first I have to say that I'm fan of her earlier works, but this is something else. This she did not need. A huge step backwards in her career. As someone (Author: siderite from Romania) already said: "Bad enough to make one doubt IMDb ratings forever".A Laughable Dystopian Thriller In the distant future, an uprising against the government of ends brutally and tragically, forcing those who survive the revolution to (a) form a new political system or (b) conform to the recent totalitarian control. Society is divided into sections called s; each has a certain specialty, like or . But despite the initially seamless system, civil unrest is mounting with slow but capable precision. At its lead is a young man or woman who bears unique traits, like or ; they are the only hope for a democratic future as the ruthless government will do everything they can to deter change. If you haven't guessed it already, I have just written the formula for creating a brand new Hunger Games/Divergent series (or run-of-the-mill video game at worst). Post-apocalyptic setting? Check! Attractive young people who want to be free at last? Check! A governmental head honcho who wants nothing more than to see those attractive young peoples heads on sticks? Check! Where The Hunger Games and Divergent split apart is specifically at the fault of their makers. Suzanne Collins concocted a series that held enough interest for the moody youths all the while pressing thought- provoking political questions; the novels, along with their film counterparts, feel timely, and most importantly, smart. Veronica Roth made a franchise of silly but entertaining (and obviously YA oriented) books more intent on action and romance instead of something deep. There's nothing wrong with that, but in the realm of film, the Divergent movies somehow feel dated. The Hunger Games films smash the box-office along with audience and critical expectations; the Divergent projects, on the other hand, limp along in comparison, looking like a crowd of Jans attempting to be one big Marcia. As much as I knew the first Divergent was manipulative formula that told me that things were more urgent than they actually were, I liked it. I liked its full-blooded action, its futuristic aromas, and most importantly, Shailene Woodley (who is on her way to becoming a major star). It wasn't great, but it didn't underestimate our intelligence, either. But months later, I couldn't remember many of the plot points: All I could recollect was a lot of running, punching, breathy kissing, brightly lit technological colors, and most importantly, Kate Winslet scowling her ass off.  Insurgent suffers from the dreaded sophomore slump (not to suggest Divergent was an unmatchable masterpiece). Like its predecessor, things are kept moving at lightning speed, and we're never bored; but unlike its predecessor, the weak links in the storyline and dialogue are much more noticeable. The first time around, we were just starting to get used to this new (yet somehow familiar) dystopian world, but in Insurgent, we've adjusted ourselves, and like someone who's lived in the same house for thirty years, flaws become much more apparent than they were before. Divergent ended with leading heroine Tris Prior (Woodley) hastily escaping the murderous government after a violent confrontation that left the Divergent hating villain Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet) with a knife in her hand (a constant reminder, as Winslet dons a distractingly large bandage). Now in hiding with love interest Four (Theo James), her brother (Ansel Elgort), and a recent ally (Miles Teller), Tris is trying to regroup; as a rose in a sea of white daisies, she is Public Enemy #1. Meanwhile, Jeanine finds herself in the possession of an ancient box that was hidden centuries ago by the creators of the Faction system. Inside The Box (it deserves a title) is a message that will come in handy in a time of crumbling systematic function; problem is, only a Divergent has the ability to unlock it. Desperate, the government begins testing every single person who resides in the Factions, hoping to find a Divergent in the crowd who has strong enough abilities to eventually get their paws on the secret message. But because Tris is the most powerful Divergent of them all, Jeanine begins a cutthroat quest to find the woman who hurt her poor little hand. If the plot sounds slightly weak, it is. It can barely hold itself together, as it wants to find an excuse to have as many loud action sequences and uninspired bits of dialogue as it possibly can. It connects the dots with hesitation. Yet, I find myself sounding way too harsh. Yes, I laughed at much of the unintentional seriousness, and yes, the script ranges from embarrassing to bland. But I had a good time at the theater, even if much of that good time was brought unintentionally. I guess that's what counts. I'm in the wrong demographic anyway (as a movie critic, I lit up at the very sight of Watts). This is a film for young teenage girls (I went with my 14-year-old sister, after all), and if I look or act anything like a teenage girl than I sincerely apologize. Insurgent doesn't quite suck, but boy is it dull. Not dull like boring; dull like a recycled joke is. It's mildly diverting, sure, but it's also kind of lame. For most established names (ahem, Kate Winslet, Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer), the film is merely a roadblock in an impressive career. But for rising talents like Shailene Woodley and Miles Teller, it's a challenge; to transcend middling material is a hugely difficult task. But Woodley and Teller are going to be stars; Insurgent will be the film they silently chuckle at when they win their Oscars someday.Bad, dull, un-original A 4 is probably generous. I'm getting sick of the Elysium genre and this is the same thing with the exception of some vivid dreams. The elites have sequestered themselves on the same planet this time. The plot is the elites can and do openly mind control everyone and segregate the population the way they think it should be separated, but some special people can't be mind controlled and have to be dealt with, by violence of course. Suffice it to say it gets weird. I mean weird. Goofy. Nonsensical. Unbelievable. All accurate descriptions of this out of control mess. I didn't see the first one, and now probably won't because I already want this 2 hours back.Don't watch it!!! First of all: i usually don't like to write review, since this movie really awful. I felt i need to do this, so you didn't do the same mistake that i do. Don't waste your time. Second, i don't understand the story. What kind of world it is. What faction is? So i just spend my precious 2 hours to watching something that i don't understand nor the movie try to explain that Third: story very very bad. At the ending, your friends successfully infiltrate the enemy headquarter without even noticed by your enemy. If it's one or two friends, that's okay. But this is the whole battalion. WUTTTTTTT??????!!!!!!I wanted to like it, I really did I'm a fan of sci-fi and fantasy. Its what I read and what I love to watch. This movie franchise took a great premise, swallowed it whole and then charged movie goers to look at the digested remains for 2 painful hours. Yeah, I'm comparing this film to fecal matter. It's harsh but fitting. This movie is so terrible that it inspired me to write my first review on IMDb. Which is saying something, being that I also saw After Earth and this is my 1st review. The dialogue hurt my ears, Woodley and James acted as if acting as actors who had no idea what acting was, the action sequences were weak at best, and then they wrap it all up with a predictable safe ending. Basically, if your IQ contains 3 digits, run from this movie. Simply Horrendous."Tweenie" dystopia copycat of Hunger Games/Battle Royale 2 Oh dear god why'd I go see this movie?! If I wanted Hunger Games: Catching Fire, I should've went to see Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Wait! No, I take that back. If I wanted Hunger Games, I should've watched Battle Royale 2. Cause if I'm honest, this movie is a copycat of a copycat. Oh how I miss the good old days! The good old days where if you went to see a movie set in a dystopian future where a corrupt government put its citizenry in peril on a whim, it was rated R because it contained great special effects, gritty foul language laced dialogue, and contained adult themes. But this! Okay! I understand the concept of movie studios dumbing this type of film down so tweens can partake in something that makes them feel like they are cool, or makes them feel like their rebelling. Even though they aren't really, they're just soaking up things that have been rehashed from what was cool 25+ years ago. Please! Tween society, realize that when everyone is a rebel, the only true rebellion is against rebellion itself!Visually Stunning... Visually the film was compelling, but it lacked the storyline so needed from the book. I felt a little disappointed watching it, thinking about what they could've done. Separating my mind from the book I would say stand alone the movie was exactly that, a great movie. My suggestion is, if you've read the books then separate your mind from what you've read except for basic skeleton of the storyline in the book itself. The skeleton is their. They just gave it a slightly altered body build that changes what readers and fans may have been expecting. In all I give it a 6/10 for my own disappointment in the storyline. I leave out any true spoilers in order to let you make your own decision about the movie.  Good luck, and have fun. To everyone who helped make the movie. I appreciate your hard work and efforts in bringing to life a fan favorite dystopia sci-fi novel series, and even though I was disappointed I will still go see the rest of the series in theatres. I started it, now I have to finish it. Felix felicis, BKLIs IMDb an instrument to promote bad movies? The IMDb rating of this terrible movie is still 6/7. How is this possible? It looks to me that some PR-agencies undermining the credibility of IMDb. I cannot take the IMDb rating serious any longer. This is a bad way to promote movies and IMDb should not be part of this. The plot is rather stupid. It reminded me of some cheap Indian gangster movies where a beautiful lady is kidnapped by some wild looking culprits and when it looks that the desperate lady will be raped and murdered, suddenly a hero jumps out behind a bush that weren't even there a minute before. I love well written sf-movies. This b-movie isn't one of it. One of the worst movies this year. I regret the time I wasted watching it. The IMDb rating for this movie should be 4/6 !!!!!!!!!!Hope there'll be no "Resurgent" after this The movie is very bad. fell asleep several times. I liked the first one; not one of the best ever, but it was fine to watch. This didn't capture my attention one bit. Didn't like the visual effects too, nor the atmosphere of the movie. The story is boring and some of the scenes are ludicrous. I didn't see it till the end, hence I don't know if the final suggest another sequel. Hope not. I don't know what's happening, but generally the sci-fi movies are getting worse. The plot, storyline, or whatever are close to nonsense or, at least, vague and superficial, and the action is all over the screen. I used to like watching "superman" or "spiderman", now: avengers, thor, ant-man, transformers are full of crap. Explosions over explosions, shitload of fights that makes me look somewhere else than the screen. Expecting "tomorrowland" now. Hope I don't get frustrated again.The reviews made me think twice, I wish i didn't. This movie was almost better then divergent. I guess 1 guy wrote a bad review and everyone else just followed the train. I never written a review until now, because it has to be done. Everything with this movie was great, i was entertained throughout the full movie. And at the end (without spoiling anything), The movie got me extra excited for the follow up allegiant. The acting was great, and the animations were wonderful. This movie was not a waste at all. You should really see this movie if you liked divergent. So stop hating and appreciate the good movies out there. 8/10 because there are better movies out there, right. But this movie is not bad at all. Definitely watch it if you want to know what happens after divergent. I would recommend this to my friends and family.nothing new All look the same these films. Seen one you can possibly avoid seeing others otherwise you risk sleep- There is action, a plot rather superficial, then the actors and director seem made to mold. the first of Its kind recently was the hunger games. I still believe That young people can have fun, Although I personally would love to see movies with blackberries introspection of the characters. We Should inspire us in the West to some good movies East: China, India, Korea and Japan. if you rely only on the effect special, something is lost in filmmaking. An example are the x men, that have become all the same, which have not wanted to deepen characters intriguing benefit of those that offered more security at the box office.Please give me back my 119 minutes Usually I don't write reviews. But this movie is so bad that I couldn't help but writing this. This is the worst movie I've watched in 2015.  First of all, I've to mention the graphics of this movie.The graphics were visually stunning. But I don't consider graphics as a scale to judge movies. The story was terrible, full of clich√©s. Anyone could guess what will happen 5 minutes later in this movie. The acting was awful. Specially I hated the main character. She tried to deliver some good performances but I don't think she was perfect for her role. The side characters were not so great either.  If you consider yourself a person with brain, please don't watch Insurgent. Save your precious 119 minutes and thank me later .It's just really, really bad So this movie is a sequel to the Divergent, pretty likable movie. The movie kinda starts where the last one left us, but the story turns very boring quickly. When it comes to some action, it's just plain horrible. So many clich√©s, but even worse. For example, a group of trained professionals shoots at people running towards the train. Shooters are basically hidden in the woods and shooting the runners, they don't hit anyone, but the runners shoot back (with no aim basically) and manage to shoot some. Facepalm #1. Later there is another scene where these "runners" are attacked by armed professionals. They appear in groups and descend on the roof of a building by some ropes, as they are shooting at these runners. They can't hit a single person out of three, although they are running away from them in a straight line. When they reach the roof, they keep shooting but miss every time. At this point I started laughing at the stupidity of it and left the cinema. Yes, it is THAT bad.I tried my best to like it. I rather like watching sci-fi movies. This is the genre I prefer watching. I watched the first one and it was really bad. Since I like watching sci-fi movies I decided that I should give this movie series a second chance. Boy was I disappointed. The second one was just as bad as the first. Really boring, predictable, bad acting, weak plot, etc. are all the tit bits you will find in this movie ... guaranteed to irritate when watching through it all. To say it was really, really bad is an understatement. It was so bad that I felt inspired to write this really bad review about it. A true shame. I'm sure it could have been much better.Not even worth watching after Divergent No character evolution, plot is very hard to believe and not reasonable at all. It seems like everything that has happened in the previous movie is just forgotten. Plot without any logic, no innovation, just repeatedly using the same plot lines again and again. Characters seem to forget everything that has happened to them, they often choose incomprehensibly redundant actions and take irrational decisions. It makes me feel sorry for all the people who spent their time on the special effects, which look great, but unbelievably poor plot just destroys the whole experience, especially after so great first movie Divergent. The first movie must have attracted many fans of titles such as Hunger Games. After watching the first movie, I couldn't wait to see Insurgent. But, unfortunately, now I must say that comparison to Hunger Games is not relevant in this case. Although the special effects are traditionally on a very high level, the poor plot together with the shallow adaptation of potentially very dramatic and epic scenes makes me feel like I should have skipped this movie and rather consider Divergent as one complete story without any follow-up.Not Great; but Not Bad This film pretty much picks right up where the last one ended with very little time lapse. Jeanine's (Kate Winslet) has issued an order that all divergents need to be killed until her soldiers find a box that was kept in Tris (Shailene Woodley) parents' house and she has discovers that she will need a divergent to open it. Tris, Four (Theo James), Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and Peter (Miles Teller) have found refuge in a little village governed by Johanna (Octavia Spencer) until the hunting begins. Eric (Jai Courtney) and Max (Mekhi Phifer) have retained their blind loyalty to Jeanine; however I think that Eric has gotten even nastier whereas Max is just trying to do his job. I have to say that loyalty is a big element in this film¬Ö.. you just never know. This film actually kept up a good pace and there was very little lull time. They said that there would be a lot more action in this film. I don't know about "a lot" more, but there was definitely more than the last one. I was also glad to see that Tris was no longer wimpy when it came down to fighting, however emotionally she was feeling pretty guilty. They really beat that dead horse throughout the film. I did not see this film in 3D, but because of all the special effect, that might have been a mistake. Man, computer generated imagery has sure come along way. It really makes me look forward to some of the upcoming films this summer like Jurassic World and Terminator. I am happy for my fellow German director Robert Schwentke who has successfully bounced back from that armpit of a film, Rest in Peace Department, RIPD for short, that he directed back in 2013. You can only go up from that one. Anyway, I think that this film will do well especially with the "tween" crowd; and once you've invested in the series it's kind of hard to not find out what happens next. Do I think that this film was one of the best films I've seen this year¬Ö¬Ö. Nope, but it was entertaining and didn't suck. I don't recommend that you see this film if you haven't seen Divergent. This one holds its own, but you'll enjoy it more if you've seen the first one.Horribly done. Make-up artists should be fired How can you honestly take a movie seriously, when the makeup is always flawless. The lead actress who cuts her hair with pruning shears and then ends up with a $500 haircut with highlights and lowlights? Her makeup always perfect after every battle. I mean, she really is going to have full makeup, eyeliner, eye shadow, blush etc. Is a war zone? I mean I understand that they want the main actress to be beautiful but how can you even remotely take a film seriously like this? At least in the hunger games, they didn't have to have Jennifer Lawrence in obvious full make up during the fight scenes, yet she still looked beautiful.  I won't even get into how boring the movie was because what I just stated were very obvious poor decision mistakes. A typical "teen" show in my opinion. Sad.Bad movie with an end which makes no sense It's one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I watched as it had a score of almost 7 but it deserves maximum 3. I watched the first movie and it was OK, it made sense. This one doesn't, and If you read the bad reviews they're right and you should trust them (ignore those that say it's great, the chemistry between the characters is incredible, they are not true). After 2 hours you get to the end which makes no sense (one of the most useless experiments, what was the goal? once that we had the perfect divergent what was going to change? if there was something that the society was doing to create one fine, but here there was nothing! it was like a mutation, you get some one who's "mutant enough@ (i.e. 100% divergent) who can open the box and get the message written 200 years before which should still be valid for the present.Why should the lover always be stuck ?? If you did not watch it yet then do not !! If you do, all what you're going to watch is love with a boyfriend. Something that could never be more boring. No action, no fights and nothing interesting at all. At least the first movie of this movie series was a little bit acceptable but, this one? I wish I could ask the creator: YOU REALLY THINK THIS COULD BE INTERISTING? IS THIS ONLY ABOUT LOVE? I swear that this movie explained to me how silly could a movie be in the cinema nowadays! No action .. just love !!! I'm really sad for those lost 2 hoursActive Great franchise of the first part. It follow ups greatly. Differently from The Hunger Games serious, the quality from the first one does not decrease, nor does the story repeat, its simply a non-stop active and fast development of one story. In addition to that, it has twists and surprises and never made me look at the time left for the movie to finish. This is how I know a movie was good.  The real-life lessons: because of the gender of the movie I did not expect to find lessons that could be applicable and I did not. The idea however is to draw a parallel on governance and politics and the sought for power.  Plausibility: almost impossible to discuss due to the gender of the movie.  Character development: I didn't see much development when it comes to the leads but what I liked was the development of Jeanine's character. Everything she did, she believed to be for a greater cause and even in the end she wanted to hide the message because she was afraid of what was outside. I like when characters are given reasons for their actions, I believe that adds to their development the most. Also, I liked Peter switching sides once he realised who cared about his life and who did not. Peter's character was supposed to be smart and honest and this switch proves that he was smart so I'd say that was well done. Caleb's actions too fit to his character- he went to Erudite because he was being selfless (I assume these were his original results) so this action is quite reasonable for his character. So well done in terms of character development (with the exception of the leads).  Casting: no critics here, I thing acting and casting was well done too but what I was quite satisfied with was Kate Winslet. She portrayed her character extremely well, she did a great performance.  Storytelling: great. The story moves quickly, there are a lot of action scenes and it does not get boring. It engages you and is quite interesting with twists and surprises at the end that are not easily guessed but should have been obvious. It makes you think 'Why did I not see that coming, it makes sense perfectly'.  Overall, very enjoyable and I would recommend it.Decent movie only after filling in blanks with cynicism This movie is fun, but suffers from various problems of stupidity. What follows makes some sense out of this insanity. I have not watched Divergent nor have I read the books. Thus I cannot consider whatever additional information they contain. The combat situations are generally unbelievable. Those shallow psychological categories cannot be taken too seriously. And there is just no way to put thousands of humans into a box without them going looking outside of it. Those simulation tests were too simplistic. Jeanine even says herself that Tris being the chosen one that can open the box "defies the laws of probability", maybe that divergence measuring device does not work quite as advertised. And just consider how unethical and impractical such a setup to find or breed the 100% divergent would be. But the last moment of this film lends credence to a darker and much more interesting interpretation. Evelyn really was the greater evil. She planted the cube to create her revolution. She created those absurd simulation tests and prepared all the crazy effective military operations long in advance. And her greatest achievement was that even Jeanine died believing the fabricated message and that there really could be something beyond the wall. And when people would eventually realize there is nothing out there, Evelyn is already their new tyrant. And a much more brutal one, as Jeanine tried to do the right thing every step of the way. Perhaps this is too cynical. Four ends up being just a useful idiot, and Tris a literal marionette to be manipulated by Evelyn. The only thing one does not have to be cynical about it the creators of this film. I prefer to believe this version.Kate Winslet steals the show! In Insurgent, the sequel to 2014's Divergent, the story picks up exactly where it left off. I very much enjoyed Divergent, and I was not let down or disappointed by Insurgent. This movie was not quite as good as its predecessor, but it certainly was NOT bad. The cast all returns here and they all do a great job filling their own roles. Kate Winslet blew me away in her portrayal of Jenine Matthews, she was so effortlessly evil and focused. Kate definitely stole the show in every scene she was in. Shailene Woodley of course was great here too! She was strong, resilient, focused, and above all, intense. Theo James was just as good here as he was before in the original, tough but tender, sweet, and handsome. Naomi Watts is a new addition to the Divergent Series cast, and she blends in quite well, dark hair and all. Miles Teller is just fine, and same for Ansel Elgort. The special effects are very top notch throughout, the CGI is so professional looking and doesn't appear fake at all. The action/violence is good and handled well too, it is not over the top or distasteful. The sensuality is here briefly, which I thought was done well, I actually would have preferred a longer scene of sensuality, to show four and tris and their love. This movie is entertaining and overall well done, but not incredible, and not quite as good as the first film in the series. 7/10 for Insurgent. Oh and the ending is pretty satisfactory.too predictable Fighting scenes are fine. But no matter how many guns are shooting, the main characters just never really got shot. Way too many bugs. For example, a smart person like Jeanine didn't expect Tris would go find the rest of Dauntless, and they couldn't locate these 175 people. And no one saw Peter entering the control room... Everyone's behavior is predictable. Christina, Peter, Caleb... Basically you can tell what they'll do next. Finally, what's wrong with all these novels and movies? Evelyn is the Divergent version of Coin from Hunger Games, and the high walls reminds me of the Maze Runner. Not sure which one comes the first, but whatever.Run in the Mill but Enjoyable YA adaptation Since the success of The Twilight Saga and The Hunger Games series many studios have been trying mirror what they achieved. This includes Summit who produced those franchises and they attempted to repeat it with the Divergent Series which is pretty much a knock-off of The Hunger Games. Though a knock-off The Divergent Series is enjoyable for fans of the YA genre. Insurgent picks up where Divergent left off, Jeanine (Kate Winslet) has successfully launched a coup and destroyed the Abnegation (selfless). Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo Jones) and the other divergents are in hiding. In the ruins of Abnegation Jeanine's forces find a box made by the founders of the society, but it could only be opened by a divergent, leading to her rounding as many as she can and forcing Tris into conflict with the tyrant once again. The Divergent Series shares a lot of ideas with The Hunger Games, they are set in a post-apocalyptic/dystopia version of America, people are split into different groups because of a certain virtues (Hunger Games it's resources or industry, in Divergent it's a characteristic) and the first film was very Hunger Games like, teenagers being tried trained for action of some sort and the characters who are training get ranked in some way. It was derivative but had it had its moments. Divergent's best feature was its Inception like simulations which allowed the film to be more inventive and it is the same for the sequel. But there are reduced, only appearing in the second half of the film as Tris is being used to open the box. These moments are when Insurgent is the most creative and fun and are on screen only too briefly. Roger Schwentke takes over the directing duties from Neil Burger and he does a decent enough job. Insurgent moves along at a brisk pace, 20 minutes has been cut from the running time and he does have an eye for showing the destroyed Chicago, even if it's mostly CGI. The opening is particularly inventive as it turns the film company logos into a video display and leads to the first scene of the film. The sequel also replaced writers Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor with Brain Duffield, Akiva Goldsman and Mark Bomback. The problem with the original film was it really was just set-up and training sequences and the plot only kicked off during the final thirty minutes. At least the Insurgent can jump into the meat of the of story which allows the film to move quicker. Insurgent is a looser adaptation of its source material and it felt like it was gutted of subplots to keep the film trim. It story involving Tris being the chosen one is generic that it was like the writers read the Hero With A Thousand Faces and that would be enough to tell a story. The action is fine, if unremarkable and it does suffer the villains being unable to shoot people in standing in an open field. The close quarter fighting was better because there was a little be of a threat to them. The special effects were of a high standard, not just for the cityscapes and the simulations but also for the small things like blue computer interfaces that float in the air. Insurgent has a great cast with Woodley making an excellent lead. She is a talented young actress and the shorter hair style suited her more, becoming a stronger presence in the sequel. One of her best moments is when she is given truth serum and suffers pain when she tries to resist. She is also surrounded by a strong cast of young actors, Miles Teller being the best as the slimy weasel Peter, a boy who would sell his mother if the price is right. He was perfect at playing someone you want to hate. The film also has excellent cast of established actors like Octavia Spencer, Naomi Watts, Daniel Dae Kim and Maggie Q but their roles are minor and Kate Winslet's Jeanine was hardly the most compelling villain. Ray Stevenson respites his role as Marcus and only has two lines. Either it was an easy paycheque or a subplot was cut. Insurgent is a perfectly serviceable YA adaptation that should please fans of the genre and fans a Hunger Games style fix. 6.5/10.I Enjoyed it This is no where near as bad as some are making out and I wonder if many have even seen it? It is quite a good film with some good action and a decent storyline. Shailene Woodley and Theo James act well together although there isn't much chemistry. I actually enjoyed this more than Divergent and the ending is just what you want to happen and leaves things open for the third. The action scenes are realistic enough and there is plenty going on not to lose interest. Maybe those who didn't like this movie prefer films with more gore and violence, who knows?Great cyberpunk flick A girl is born different ‚Äì she is an outsider in a world of cliques; not because she is incapable of melding with any of the different factions that society exists in, but the fact she is considered a member of all of them. This rarity makes her an unknown variable that would otherwise destabilize the system for the current factions. Why do these factions exist? For the simple fact that outside the walls surrounding a city the world is a wasteland; even within the city it is covered in abandoned ruins. So we enter a dystopian future, full of cyberpunk elements and special effects to match. There is a little bit of romance here and there and characters are either made to show their angst for each other, or otherwise profess their undying love as fanservice. The main character isn't exactly what I'd call a so- called Mary Sue, but she does get attack, battered, and otherwise abused a lot. Special mention must be given to the Matrix like scene involving a holodeck ‚Äì the main character literally jacks into the holo- simulator and sits in a mock-chair of wires, not unlike Neo. I do recommend this movie though; it will work wonders for those needing their sci-fi and cyberpunk fix.It's a cheat INSURGENT is the latest young adult dystopian thriller to hit cinemas, following on from the previous instalment, DIVERGENT. I didn't like the first film, which had potential but wasted it in a too-familiar storyline, but this film is far, far worse. It's a movie that cheats and destroys audience expectations throughout by fuddling every single dramatic moment in the whole story. The whole gamut of ways to cheat a viewer occur here: dramatic events that turn out to be dreams, characters who die but turn out not to be dead, characters who become turncoats only to reveal that they're not so bad after all. Basically everything important in the plotting is a lie, and that's the kind of thing that really annoys me as a viewer. Come the end of the film, very little of actual substance has taken place. Otherwise, we get a bloated storyline with barely any good set-pieces or incidents, and instead just a lot of back and forth stuff. The emoting is particularly over the top this time around, and during a key scene in which star Shailene Woodley is forced to recall some past traumatic events, I found myself sniggering at her pitiful attempts at emotion. She's really bad, which is a surprise given she was quite good in the first film. The big name stars like Naomi Watts and Kate Winslet are poor too, and genuinely good players like Jai Courtney and Ray Stevenson are underutilised.Polished turd at best From a technical and cinematographic there is nothing wrong with this film, hence why I have it a five and not lower, in regards to the book this film is awful. Divergent did a fairly good job of conveying the first book with slightly less depth; Insurgent, however, stripped almost all of the depth and intricacies of the book and turned it into a mindless film that ends all nicely tied up with a bow. To say Insurgent took creative liberties with the book would be a massive understatement, what it did do was take out many of the unpleasant but intriguing elements, invent major changes in the plot that are not remotely congruent with the books narrative rendering it shallow and patronising to not just adults but also youth.Defy Reality in "The Divergent Series: Insurgent" "The Divergent Series: Insurgent" once again gets hate from some book fans who complain about changing the book. In the book, there's a hard drive that contains the message. In the movie, it's replaced with the box that contains all sims of five factions. It's being done to reduce screen time, as the novel is quite long. The movie picks up where "Divergent" leaves. Tris and her allies try to hide from a faction leader named Jeanine. A mysterious box is kept at Erudite, which contains a message from the founders of Chicago. Only a Divergent can open the box and unleash the truth about the past. I love how this film surpasses the previous one in action sequences and some good amount of drama. My favorite scenes are the Amity chase scene, the Dauntless sim, and the Amity sims. The viewers also explore the settings of Amity, Candor, and the Factionless. I love the city-shattering scenes in Amity sims. The Dauntless sim is remarkable. It's where a flying burning house is prominently shown in trailers, and that's like a dream sequence but still very stunning to see. It's also notable that some characters' loyalties are confusing. Who can you trust? It's hard to tell. The ending is quite a shock. I'm very eager to see the follow-up movie, "The Divergent Series: Allegiant". Hooray, Initiates!Forgettably Bland I was coerced into seeing Divergent in the theater and surprisingly found it entertaining. I do respect Woodley's style of acting (adorably innocent and sweet-natured) although unfortunately, for this second installment she seems to lack the 'bad-assery' implied for her character. The spark we saw between the two new lovers Tris and Four in Divergent was no where to be seen here. I was disappointed by the anti-climactic storytelling, being made more unbearable by the fact that I cared very little for the characters. SPOILER: When Tris seemingly dies in the chamber, I felt worse for Winslet's character (she needed her alive for the box thing) than for Woodley's death! Though the 'heroes' of the story did very little to move the story along, they conveniently and predictably kept being carried through the story. This movie was so boring. I can't even remember where the time went. Perhaps I blacked out, but I was in the bath so if I did that I guess I'm lucky to be alive. Pfft. I'm going to be wary of the next two movies, sadly. I'm sorry to the actors who were not written in properly. I did give you a chance! :(The first one was not especially good, this one is worse I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic dystopian genre, I cannot help it, whenever something new is released I have to see it. More often than not I'm disappointed with the movie, usually it's a promising good idea but wasted, a lot of CGI and not much depth. I suffered through Hunger Games but survived, it was not as bad as it could be, and then the Divergent arrived. The first one was not especially good but it was sort of watchable and mildly interesting, introducing all these factions and the (implausible) way the worlds is run. It just would not function that way but it's a movie . But the second one, Insurgent, deteriorated enormously. The villains are getting more and more evil and one-dimensional, turning into caricatures, long dead mother suddenly showing up, teen romance getting very cheesy (and additionally a 30 years old guy playing a teenager, regardless of his youthfulness and good looks, is just ridiculous). All the novelty of the first one is long gone and we are left with the dull story, lack of tension and underdeveloped stereotypical characters. I wouldn't recommend this movie, you will miss nothing by not watching it. Saying that, I will probably still watch the next two installment due to my above mentioned post-apocalyptic compulsion.More of a film trying to work up to the next one I've read all the books in the Divergent series and honestly, Insurgent wasn't my favourite. I liked it substantially more than Allegiant, but not nearly as much as Divergent. With that said, I honestly liked this film more than the first, but that's probably because it was much more visually appealing. I liked the way the film was directed when it came to just looking at the scenes with the volume down, and I liked the cinematography, but I honestly didn't like how the story was told and how much they wasted opportunities to develop the characters. My biggest issue is with Four/Tobias. The first movie was how long? 2 and a half hours? This movie I'm guessing was roughly the same. We've had five whole hours of film and I still BARELY know the character. He's just a really good-looking guy who says everything like he's in a perpetual bad mood. I wanted to see them work with his character, and try to make something of it. In this movie, that just didn't happen. My next problem was mainly with the plot. I barely understood the plot in the book - that's probably just because I don't really remember it - but I understood enough of it to know that it was changed in the movie, and honestly I preferred it. It wasn't a strong plot and at times I was thinking 'what the hell is happening? Why is it only Tris who can do this? What is with all this 'chosen one' kind of stuff?', but it was mildly entertaining to watch, and very easy on the eyes with all the special effects that at times didn't really make much sense. With that said, I was applauding Shailene's performance for almost single-handedly carrying the entire movie. I feel that if she had been given more to work with, she would have made this a wonderful movie with the kind of performance she's capable of. I also liked Miles Teller's acting - I found it amidst the movie's aim to make itself sensible and serious rather refreshing. I don't regret watching the movie, and I'll probably watch the Part one and Part two of the last book because I feel that I need to watch the movie if I've read the book. I have no idea how they'll manage to salvage anything movie-worthy from Allegiant though, but I'll endure it. -A movie better than its novel. My score is solely based on the fact that the movies so far have entertained me far better than the books. The tweaks in the script from the original novel is certainly value added...so far! The family bond (Tris' family), the chemistry of Tris &amp; Four, the evils of Jeanine &amp; Evelyn, and most of all the narration, are all brilliantly held up. Even more, the characters that did not make it to the movie (from the original novel) are rarely missed. The cast live up to their standards, and the direction is decent as well. Having said that, the recent age of these dystopic, virtual reality, post apocalyptic themed adaptations already feel like a drag. Still, hoping for the last part of the trilogy to come out as good as Divergent &amp; Insurgent. In the very least, the series seem much less violent than its counterparts, suiting my taste.And the "milking" has begun. Watched this on DVD from my public library. I found "Divergent" to be a smart, novel story of a select few not fitting into the categories set up to classify people according to their natural tendencies. Shailene Woodley as Tris was the prime divergent, we see her selection process, her training, and ultimately her escape from the walled Chicago. This movie, "Insurgent", takes up where that one left off. We get to see what is outside the walls. But what we see isn't particularly gratifying. Then we see Tris (and a few others) hopping a train to get back inside the wall. So most of this movie takes place where the first one did, Tris and her cohorts fight to restore order and dignity to all the citizens. While there isn't anything particularly wrong with this story, to me it just seems a way to "milk" the concept, for the author to sell more books, for Hollywood to make more movies, all simply to make more money. I am not a big fan of the "milking" concept.  Now I see the next story is being made as two movies, part 1 and part 2. I will say now "count me out", I refuse to participate. SPOILERS: At the end we find that indeed there are people and communities outside the wall. In fact the 5-faction community inside the wall was set up as a test of sorts, and the final message was that divergents were the key to make all this work. Not only were divergents NOT dangerous, they needed to be respected and cultivated. Well "duh", that is exactly how our society has prospered for all of humanity, major discoveries and other advances are primarily the result of those who "diverge" from the norms of society.A lot of fuss about nothing! 4/10 Review: I wasn't a big fan of the first movie so my expectations for the sequel wasn't that high. I also wasn't that bothered about any of the characters and I really didn't remember the plot from the first movie so I went into this film a bit blind. There are a few references to the first film but I thought that the storyline was straight forward and not that bad. The main character, Tris (Shailene Woodley) looked a bit lost all the way through the film and she seemed like she was on her own agenda, regardless about how many people got killed or risked there life for the cause. Its really hard to explain the storyline, as I didn't really remember the first movie but I think that it's about a group of people who are on the run from Jeanine (Winslet) because they didn't want to live in her controlled world anymore. There are other elements to the story but it will take a long time to write about it, so I think I should leave it at that. Basically you have to watch it to get it! Personally, I wasn't a big fan of the film because it all seemed a bit over the top and there wasn't that much depth to the characters. Tris didn't seem that bothered about how many people were sacrificing there life's for her and Winslet was just being a cold bitch on her own agenda, regardless on the amount of life's she was sacrificing as well. Some of the action scenes were OK but I really wasn't a fan of the two main characters. They were just too intense throughout the whole film and they seemed to have the whole world on there shoulders which made them very one dimensional. I lot of the CGI was unnecessary and over the top, especially when she was hooked up to those wires, going through the various simulators controlled by Winslet. At the end of the day, it's a very pointless film which I didn't really find that entertaining but it's watchable and we'll put together. Average! Round-Up: I really liked Shailene Woodley, 23, in a Fault in Our Stars because she brought a lot of emotion and realism to the role but she seemed a bit wooden in this film. Maybe because there was so much going on around her! She does cry very well but she didn't really bring anything to the table, except for a couple of well choreographed action scenes. They still have another two movies planned for this franchise, called Allegiant 1 &amp; 2 so we might get to see another side to her Divergent self. I'm not a big fan of Theo James because he lacks emotion and he seems to play off of his squared jawed looks a bit too much. He just seemed like the loved up action hero throughout the movie who was willing to sacrifice everything for his woman, which was a bit creepy. He obviously hated his parents, which the sequel might delve into after the introduction of Naomi Watts as his mother. She looked more like his girlfriend to me! Anyway, the movie was directed by Robert Schwentke who brought you movies like the terrible R.I.P.D., RED, with Bruce Willis, Flightplan and The Time Travellers Wife with Eric Bana. I would have liked to have seen another director take on the two Allegiant movies, to give the whole franchise a fresh flavour and maybe a more human side to the characters but it looks like this director is committed to the whole franchise. His interpretations of the books has gone down quite well with audiences and he has made an hefty profit for the studios but I personally think that it's a lot of fuss about nothing. Budget: $110million Worldwide Gross: $295million I recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/sci-fi/thrillers about a colony of people on the run from there hometown because they didn't want to live under there rules and relegation's. 4/10At least this was a bit better than the first part .... "Divergent 100%. I'll be damned. What? She's what we've been looking for."  I really start hating those damn different film versions of children's books. They are always spread over several films so you always have to wait a year before you can see the sequel. Similarly this sequel to "Divergent". I could still partially remember what it was about, but the first 15 minutes I was actually systematically trying to reconstruct the previous film. It would be best to watch the previous movie once again before you start a sequel. But then again this happens never due to the lack of time. And then, to know that the last part of the sequel is again divided into two films, and that for the obvious reasons. Let's hope that my biggest fear won't come true, namely that we'll be overwhelmed by serial-like movies in the future. Logically one makes a comparison with the similar series of films of "The Hunger Games". The first part of the latter was clearly way better than "Divergent". But "Insurgent" surpasses again the second part of "The Hunger Games" . I thought the latter was a faint duplicate of the first part. I had the tendency to check all the time to see if I hadn't started the wrong movie. "Insurgent" continues where the first part left off (quite logical, no?). It doesn't waste any time and soon it plunges itself into a series of thrilling action sequences. Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James), Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and Peter (Miles Teller, who made a greater impression on me in "Whiplash"), the least reliable gland of the group, were separated from the rest of Dauntless. This faction had to flee after Jeanine (Kate Winslet) started a coup during which she wanted to eradicate "divergents" (for those who didn't know, Tris is Divergent which allegedly means she could belong to any faction) because they constitute a threat for the peaceful society as it exists now. Meanwhile Jeanine's troops have found a mysterious device with all symbols of all factions printed on it. Seemingly it contains a message from the founders of the city and can only be opened by someone who can undergo all the simulations without dying. Guess twice who the lucky volunteer will be!  Last year I said to myself not to watch the next parts of this series because it was so predictable and because of the teenage girl content. Well, you can see I gave in but no regrets this time. Yet only a few remarks. The uncomplicated way Tris could create such a trendy, modern styled haircut without a mirror and with a primitive-looking scissors (looks like an illustration from a glossy magazine which you can find on the table at your local hairdresser), even stunned my wife with a marveled reaction as a result. This will be the new hair style this summer, I guess. Then it occurred to me again that nobody can get on or off a train in a typical manner. And then there is the thrilling fact that seemingly without much effort (they are massively sought and still they can stroll around everywhere calmly) they are being overpowered, after which suddenly they are again liberated. And then of course the obligatory lovescenes are present as well. But otherwise, this film is filled with action and the CGI is at times unprecedented that'll take your breath away. Especially the simulations looked amazing and detailed (especially the house floating through the air). The fact that you didn't know whether it was real or a simulated situation became a bit monotonous. But the film went on at a furious pace so you won't be bored for a minute. It's a certainty that I'll be watching the last part as well although I'll probably be p*ssed because of them making 2 films out of it. The end result will surely be two quite largely stretched-out parts. More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMTWaiting for next part for something promising!!!! The Divergent Series: Insurgent (also known simply as Insurgent) is a 2015 American science fiction adventure film directed by Robert Schwentke, based on Insurgent, the second book in the Divergent trilogy, written by Veronica Roth. It is the sequel to the 2014 film Divergent and the second installment in The Divergent Series.Along with the first film's returning cast, the sequel features supporting actors Octavia Spencer, Naomi Watts, Suki Waterhouse, Rosa Salazar, Daniel Dae Kim, Jonny Weston, Emjay Anthony, and Keiynan Lonsdale. Now on the run from Jeanine (Kate Winslet) and the rest of the power-hungry Erudites, Tris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James) search for allies and answers in the ruins of Chicago. They must find out what Tris' family sacrificed their lives to protect and why the Erudites will do anything to stop them. Side by side, Tris and Four face one seemingly insurmountable challenge after another, as they unravel the secrets of the past and -- ultimately -- the future of their world.A Weaker Sequwl To Divergent, Because It Is More Predictable Yes, this is so - this movie is not bad at all, but it is just a bit more predictable and more similar to those that many critics compared this Roth's adaptation with. I never read Veronica Roth's books and can judge the film only. This part is a bit shorter than Divergent, but it is also slower far too often, and all those huge video effects are welcoming, but seemingly too too much. They divert attention from something more important. What is the message? You got that? I was a bit dazzled by the finale of the film. Yes, there'll be 2 more parts, and I am not so deadly sure they will that good, either, but time will tell. The movie itself leaves the same weak spots - underdeveloped characters, some plot holes, excessive dialogs, excessive violence with no real validity. There are some huge goofs, too and they keep me from paying more attention to the plot. Shailene Woodley as Beatrice "Tris" Prior and Theo James as Tobias "Four" Eaton did a cool job, though I was so wholly impressed by their relations. One thing I could not shake off all the time was that vague sense of teenage audience targeting in this film, as it never raised on to a more mature or deeper level, sometimes leaving the smack of some strong but not superb comic book. Daniel Dae Kim as Jack Kang and Ashley Judd as Natalie Prior were seemingly nice addition to the cast, but they have not left a more lasting impression, and this unshakable feeling of some surface swimming and too hasty depiction never let go. My advice - yeah, sure watch this, too. It is not bad, it is just not overtly great, just solidly OK.Enjoyable B-Movie. Overall I enjoyed the movie. There were a lot of ideas to chew on. There was a love story. It's a great B-movie. But in the end there were so many holes in the plot. It is a huge sprawling story. What motivates the characters is weird. Humans accepting their place in the world means they have been genetically modified to be like cattle.  Why after 200 years did no one every think about going over the wall encircling the city - particularly the divergents who were being hunted down. Why the message in the box was so important that divergents had to be killed? It is like a fight for the fortune in a fortune cookie. And in the end, why the message has any meaning is confusing. And if you are seriously interested in the next installment of this series, it is a depressing downer. I doubt I will even attempt to go to the movies much less watch it at home if it gets made.  Insurgent should be the end of the story. It has a somewhat confusing but positive end to the story. And the good guys won. It is great to see Kate Winslet in an evil character. What motivates her to monomaniacally figure out what is in the box is hard to believe. It is good to see so many young actors. Miles Teller is scarily a John Cusack clone. It thought he was John's son.Sceptical at first because of the review, but ya'll are wrong and just mad. First of all I don't get why people gives these 1/10 ratings all the time for this. You are not pleased what you just encountered here dear audience?  I felt strongly sharing the seat with these so called divergents since the 1st movie but when I saw what kind of ratings this movie had received I almost skipped this one completely.  In the end I am glad that I didn't do that because it was good! Best movie I've watched this summer and the ending is just genius, isn't it overheated, mad IMDb reviewers? ;)  I bet you who reviewed this 1-3/10 felt that those divergents were the losers what you bullied in the schools and you felt more like that you belong to the factions there were? I really can't imagine any other explanation why you guys can go that crazy with your reviews what comes to this movie. This movie series isn't about copying Hunger Games like most of you like to say here when you diss this movie, of course they got some things in common since they are based to Sci-Fi books for youngsters but seriously, this was much better than the last Hunger Games - at least in my opinion.Not Original but Good in all the Ways the Count While the story yells "Hunger Games" rip off, it is not the movies fault - remember that this was a book before a movie. It was Veronica Roth, writer of the 'Divergent Series' that took and adapted many of the Hunger Game dystopian classist/faction ideas to her books. If you are all about those kinds of movies, then this movie will not disappoint you! However, if you strongly prefer originality and something that feels like the first of it's kind you should skip this movie. The dialogue was great but could be a little clich√© at times. And yes, while it felt like I was watching a Hunger Games clone, the story was still very refreshing. I'm a sucker for these kinds of films so I was entertained throughout the movie. Was I on the edge of my seat the whole time? No. Was I taken aback by the unpretictableniss of the plot? Sometimes. Would I watch again? Probably not until I read the actual book. Tris can be a little annoying at times and some parts of the movie just were so unbelievable that I did find it hard to stay engaged. I mean cm-on, are we just supposed to believe that out of nowhere they can create this tool that has the ability to read a person's character and rate their divergence on a level from 0% to 100%? Then the one person who hits the 100% must have this crazy ability to pass all the tests to open this stupid little box with a secret hidden message from the founders of their walled society? Thats about as believable as what the circus fortune teller tells me for $5. Regardless, if you can ignore these things and just accept them as they are the story and action sequences make up for some of these kinds of pitfalls. If you are looking for to watch a movie that is easy to follow, has mild violence, and a decent and compelling story line Insurgent can be an easy way for you to kill a boring night.'Insurgent' improves upon the first film and manages to make me care First, there was a film based on the first book in a trilogy, that was pretty good. Then, there was the sequel, that would either make or break this franchise. For our first review, let's take a look at... ...Insurgent. Insurgent is the second installment in The Divergent Series, based off of the bestselling series by Veronica Roth. The film follows Tris and Four's journey to try and officially end the faction system forever, by dealing with a mysterious box that could change every ideal they've lived by. I'm a semi-avid fan of the novels, enjoying the first two while disliking the third. I don't really care how the novels and the films are different, because I know that every book-to-film adaptation is different, but the thing about this movie is that it takes a massive detour from the book, and in a good way. I will not spoil how, but the major plot point that takes up the latter half of the film is not in the book, however, the end result is. Judging the film by it's own merits, it's fairly enjoyable. Tris and Four still get a lot of screen time together and a lot of character development, which is great, because they're going to need it in the last two installments of this franchise, but that also means that the other characters suffer. Several new characters are introduced, and while the actors playing them all do fine, the characters they play are mostly one-dimensional. I was able to look past this due to my familiarity with the novels, but I can see how it would be a point of contention for serious reviewers. The plot works, to a point. Tris and Four are first at Amity with Marcus, Peter and Caleb, however, things change as most of the other characters leave within the first twenty minutes, later reappearing in certain parts of the storyline. Perhaps my biggest problem with the story, and my greatest strength, is the box that the film revolves around. No spoilers, but the way they have to open the box, is kind of dumb in my opinion. They never would have been able to do the box if a character didn't pull a "Harry Potter" as I say (giving yourself up for death, yet still living). The music is probably my favorite thing in the film. Listening to the soundtrack after the film, the music is used when needed, and it fits the movie well. Better than the first film's did, at any rate. The cinematography and the way the film was shot and edited is very well done. It's better than the first film at that. However, one thing the film really does fall short on is the visual effects. Some sequences are done well (the flying through decrepit city with burning house scene shown in trailer, for example), but there is a final battle at the end of the film that looked really strange to me, at least. I think they could have used some more time to polish up the effects, and give it an added sense of realism. As I mentioned before, the actors did a fantastic job. The standout, is of course, Shailene Woodley as Tris. Shailene gives the character some much needed depth and some emotional resonance with the audience. If anybody else had played Tris, or someone less emotional, we would not have felt for Tris as we do in a few key scenes (Truth Serum, is all I'll say), and the film would have suffered further for it. All in all, Insurgent is a intriguing film, bogged down by the usual teen film tropes, some bad effects and some plot issues, but overall, an improvement over the first film, and I'm pretty excited to see the finale to this pretty good trilogy. 8/10. Grade: BGood but not what it should have been.. The trailers to this movie before it came out were amazing, but like all trailers it showed more than half of all the good parts. I'd like to address something that another person wrote in their review. I believe his name was Tim Burgess. First off, yes you heard right, they did change quite a few things and that's OK to an extent. The box that Jeanine was trying to have Tris open is not in the book at all, rather it is a file that was on her computer that she had stolen from Abnegation, not a box that she had the Dauntless traitors search for. Also the machines they attached to her for the simulations do not exist in that way. How it is supposed to be is that they have her lay on either a chair or metal table ( It has been awhile since I read the book so I can't remember cause usually it's a chair, but Jeanine was doing things differently that time.) and like usual insert a needle into her neck and inject the serum while being hooked up to a heart machine and wires to transfer the information to the computer. Also you talked about how they say Tris is supposed to be Brave and Strong and all that, but that she didn't look like it and should have worked out more. When they implied/said that about her they meant it emotionally, not physically. Because you didn't read the books I don't know if you realized that the entire series from Divergent to Allegiant takes place in 6 months or less, and from Divergent to Insurgent it had only been a couple months total. So no, she wouldn't have bulked up to that point anyway. She is supposed to seem small and fragile but have the heart of a warrior. I did like the movie but it would be nice if for once a movie that was made from a book could actually follow the book as closely to if not exactly how it goes in the book, but alas that will never happen because each director and script writer has their own take on how it should go. Lastly I am NOT looking forward to the fact that they are splitting the last book into two movies. Worst idea ever!!! Especially cause throughout the entire book it jumps back and forth between Tris' perspective to Tobias', and also there really isn't all that much action or fighting in the last book either. The only way they could do two movies is either A) Have them both be pretty boring or B) Change almost everything about how it goes in the book. I will go see them regardless, but I already know I am going to be disappointed.I love it! although it's not quite like the book, insurgent is just an amazing ride, with really good special effects and very good acting, especially from woodley, who is outstanding! the story itself, differs from the books and it is a bit convoluted, divergent is a bit better in that way. Just know what you're in for, a fun action ride. Theo James was surprisingly good, he gave a deep performance. Some of the main cast acted like they didn't wanted to be there, Ansel for example. miles teller was so funny and good, i really really liked peter a lot more in this movie. so, watch it, it's good, but not perfect,as i said before, the story could be better, it is different from the books, a lot, but actually, it didn't bothered me. the final sequence in the film was mind-blowing! i just loved it...average This wasn't too bad a sequel to the Divergent movie as it mostly serves as an "in between" movie. Kind of like Back to the Future Part II. It relies mostly on action scenes and special effects. The lead actress's performance was good and the action scenes carried it pretty well but only so far. I liked it pretty well though. If you are a fan of the series and are curious, you might give it a try.Brilliant Sequel One of the best on par sequels Ive seen in recent years . I love book adapted movies.Hunger Games + The Matrix It is clear these books were rushed out as a copy cat hoping to capitalize on the wildly successful Hunger Games series. The formula was the same. A dystopian future society where people have been arbitrarily divided and oppressed and a young girl who is ready to challenge the whole thing.  Hunger Games was much more thoughtful and layered, however. At its core it was a story about totalitarian regimes based on Susan Collins very real experience of living in a communist country as a military brat growing up.  Divergent lacked any such layers or depth, but did in some ways make for a more entertaining movie. But at its core it was essentially just a high school coming of age story masquerading as Sci-Fi. You had the high school cliques - the jocks, the nerds, the hippies, the do-gooders and you have Tris Prior who doesn't seem to belong to any one group and is "factionless" (which in dystopian future Chicago seems to be the equivalent of having to sit alone at lunch). Divergent also gets points for all of the guys around our female heroine not being totally worthless, Four is quite capable and Peter proves himself to be of some use in Insurgent.  But Tris is not going to be content to shoot a bow &amp; arrow from a distance. That more believable combat is traded for Tris routinely beating up men with ease, which always strains credibility.  The love story is better in Divergent, as at least our young heroine doesn't fall for a completely useful wet noodle of a guy.  My praise ends there, however, as the story at its core makes zero sense. Essentially 200 years ago, founders created an "experiment" that they would not live to see the outcome of and apparently expected to fail.  That experiment is in full on failure as "Jeanine" (has there been a worse name for a villain in movie history?) is seeking to crack down on the Divergents and maintain power over the 3 remaining factions (we did away with 2 in the first movie and yet nobody in the remaining 3 factions seems to think that anything is amiss). But Jeanine is going be challenged by a teenage girl who in true Joan of Arc style (the original Katniss Everdeen) is set to rally an army with her boyfriend Four and the help of his mother, played by Naomi Watts, exactly 16 years older than Theo James. Seems plausible, but not if you age like a Hollywood actress, she looks like his big sister. The movie spends the last half ripping off The Matrix, including the scene where Neo dies, in order for Katniss, er Tris to fulfill her destiny of decoding the founders message. We imprison Jeanine at the end, thus we are 2 movies ahead of the Hunger Games which might explain why there is no box office rationale for the 4th film which would complete the series. Although of course, we can't just imprison Jeanine, because presumably Four's mom now wants to take up the Juliane Moore role of dictatorette. Divergent had enough action and pace to warrant cinematic consideration, but the weak foundation of the series cannot support two stories. Other than getting to live in dystopian Chicago, it is unclear what benefit Jeanine actually receives by oppressing 5 factions of people. As others have noted, the zombie train system makes no sense and for being a totalitarian state, the government in Insurgent is decidedly void of surveillance technology.  If you liked Divergent, stop there, leave it at that, and take the wins when you can get them.From bad to worst OK, Divergent wasn't any kind of masterpiece, but I was at least entertained a few times watching it. Insurgent is so bad, I didn't get even once scene... NOT ONE SCENE... that I could call entertaining. Acting? Terrible. Script? Not one thing made sense. CGI? Laughable. And the ending? So ridiculously bad it was borderline offensive. Whoever wrote this script, please take their pen away. Please!Wasted an evening of my life and a Cineplex gift card I went and saw this movie with my mom because I heard it was a sci-fi action movie. Within 15 minutes in, I was horribly bored. 10 minutes later, I left the theater and called my dad to come and pick me up. He didn't want to so I was screwed. My stupid ass didn't think to call a cab so I spent the entire runtime of this movie waiting in the Christing lobby reading the same Cineplex magazine over and over again.  Since I had bought the tickets on a gift card, I couldn't get my money back so that was $25 down the f***ing toilet. It was the worst experience I have EVER had in a movie theater and the only movie I've ever walked out of.Bland, lazy dystopian sci/fi Probably the worst indictment I can give this forgettable franchise is that the only characters with any level of character development throughout the entire trilogy are bad guys and antiheroes. Our heroes, by stark contrast, start off being kind and virtuous and skilled in every conceivable way and thus are never required to grow as characters. I'm not sure if this is a problem in YA writing, film writing or feminist writing, possibly all of the above, but I can't help but notice similarities between the Divergent franchise and the Hunger Games: both of these purport to present a strong female role-model, and yet neither succeed in presenting anything but a petulant Mary Sue who inexplicably finds herself the center of her respective universe. Despite being an uppity go-getter who smashes through dozens of armed men at a whim, Triss is an object: things happen to her not because of the choices she makes but because she is divergent. In this regard Triss, like Katniss is a strange hybrid between the role of the princess and the role of the hero: both the object of the quest as the person going on the quest for said object. The result is muddled story telling without a point, because unlike a classical hero these spunky heroines never really have to grow to prove their worth; as the princess their value is inherent in what they are. Now I could go on to describe how this series features every clich√© in the dystopian sci/fi genre, but frankly I wouldn't have cared if the material were competently handled. The operative word being "if". Sadly, the introduction to this setting, with its factions and it's bigotry-against-divergents, is done so lazily that you're left yelling "WHY?!" at the screen for two films straight before the franchise even tries to answer basic questions about the premise, despite the fact that virtually all the drama stems from it. On the plus side, this franchise had a few interesting ideas, albeit poorly executed, and the visuals were not half bad. Overall though, would only recommend as an exercise in critical film viewing, not as a legitimate film-viewing experience.Nice scenery :-) While this film is the same type of film where 12 year olds seem to read this pap about 17 to 23 year olds being the heroes and anyone over 30 being evil or irrelevant, like the sad and hopeless hunger games, where life is futile and pointless, there was something about this film that I came to like. Maybe I just ignored that tragic perspective about a sad future of the world where everyone has been put under some kind of 1984esq loss of freedom. The characters were determined to get to the source of the problem and bring resolution, and determination &amp; grit ruled the day. I loved the escape by train scene. Not a bad one.A slight step back in the series Insurgent is the sequel to the follow up Divergent released in 2014. There does seem to be more action sequences and stunts both they are repetitive. The entire plot is quite basic, with Tris and Four wanting to find and kill the leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet) since she is doing harm to the other people in the factions and such. A running time of slightly less than two hours, a lot of the film contains slightly meaningless scenes of build up or to make up time.  A scene featuring them fighting against 'factionless' people on the train was quite well done but at the same time a little silly and pointless. Following the fight, after causing much damage and killing some of their crew, Four tells the leader of the 'factionless' his name then it all stops, because Four was the one they wanted and were looking for. They apparently didn't know it was him but knew of his name. It would have made a lot more sense had Four stated his name prior to fighting. As well with some of the scenes towards the end involving Tris being in some kind of 'simulation' with wires hooked on her, are thought to be interesting, but at the same time more could have been done and less predictable. The effects looked nice. The weak plot, and not much character development is what was holding this film back, as well with scenes that drag on. This film, one can tell feels quite different than the original and that a different director directed it. The style and tone feel a little off and Tris was slightly different. It's as if she didn't care too much about some of the people that were sacrificing themselves for her, and they made her a little more aggressive, angry and confused but in some ways it was expected. Perhaps a little over the top. Insurgent isn't terrible but it's a slight step back from Divergent. Opinions may differ.Mediocre and full of awkward theses An uninspired and lame copy of much better books and films. Rather bad actors and lots of boring dialogues and "inner conflict" nonsense that feels constructed and totally off. Unbelievable dystopia full of logic holes and unexplainable magic devices. Nothing you will remember or wish to see continued.Boring So...I had this movie since forever in my laptop and since there was no WiFi I thought, well, what the hell? let's get it over with..I have already read the books unlike other people and I gotta say, the movie is even more boring than the books tbh... The only reason I gave 5 is because i REALLY liked Cate's portrayal of Jeanine...her scenes are the only ones that was memorable to me...Four, tris, Caleb- the characters are so one-dimensional, that there should be an award for who was the most one-dimensional of them all... will watch allegiant when I have nothing else to watch AT ALL... like seriously, my clich√©d Korean and Chinese dramas are better than this since I go there with the expectations that it will be clich√©d but with Hollywood movies I am used to having more expectations..Spot on. Absolutely loved this film and in fact all three in the series. Easy to watch and enjoyable. There are a few 'professional critics' giving low scores however if they pulled their heads from their butts they may just chill out and enjoy the film too! The two hours average for each of these films feels about right, enough to establish a story without it dragging on. I would however have been just as happy with another 20 - 30 minutes of content!my favorite divergent series movie. I really liked this film a lot. Shailene Woodley does such a great job in this movie! You really go on the journey with her in this film! I loved Kate Winslet and Octavia Spencer in this film. they bring such strong characters into this film and the action in this film is so great. Theo James in this is so great and he is sooo cute!! And I love the relationship between him and Shailene!! This movie is great and I know people have their own opinions about the Divergent films but like with Twilight these are fun and entertaining films. the acting is way better in this than Twilight though. I will always love the Divergent series and I want to read the books.These films are great and I will always enjoy them.A slight improvement over Divergent Yes, this trilogy is definitely not worth investing any of your time in it. That is the fact. However, my seven stars go for the slight improvements in the plot, visual effects and action. Yes, this trilogy started as one of the biggest failure in imitating The Hunger Games, but I think they started to "diverge" starting from the middle part of the second sequel. The story started to be much more original and that's why I will give other sequels a chance as well. Nonetheless, one cannot escape the feeling that the whole plot is a bit shallow, there are many scenes when you are just wondering what the hell is this or how did this even happen? Obviously, someone could have done a better job in transferring the book into the movie, unless the book itself is shallow. Remains to be seen. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this movie. The only ones who are completely going to enjoy this trilogy are teenage girls, while they drool over the perfect male super-masculine protagonist. As for the teenage boys, sorry lads, the female protagonist is not hot (at all).Much better I found Divergent disappointing but Insurgent is a lovely film. In Insurgent, Triss is showing that she truly is Divergent. Previously, I had complained about her acting in the first film, which I had found to be somewhat one dimensional. In hindsight, I believe it to be very well played and Insurgent shows the full range of the actress' ability. I also loved the music in the film. I might have used rock music myself but I'd have been wrong. This was better. It fit the script and the plot. Now I'm looking forward to watching Allegiant tomorrow. Thank you all for producing such a lovely piece of film. Thank you also for showing that the second in the series does not have to be the worst. Sometimes it can be the best. Indeed... It was also the best book in the series.It's better than the first one, but that's not really a compliment. The first one was okay. It's a good film if you have 2 hours to kill, but if you want a quality film, then it's not for you. And the same counts for this one. Let's start with the positives. While the action in the first one was just a little meh, the action is amped up in this one, and the result is excellent. The train fight was stunning, the small duel between Tris and Peter is great, and so are the others. The acting is sorta good as well. Shailene gives a solid performance, and Miles Teller is also great. The scale and scope of this film is much larger than its predecessor, and the effects are much better, and less noticeable, and it's altogether a better film. But it's also got some negatives. Why are they here? Why do the factions work? What if you're both kind and selfless, and does that make you Divergent? What happened? All these questions were left unanswered in the first film, and still weren't answered in this one. The same thing happened with the Maze Runner, and seemingly with all YA films. While that does leave to theorize what happens next, it's sort of annoying not knowing what happened. Also, why trust Peter? He beat you up, and tried to kill you in the first film, he betrayed you to Jeanine TWICE, and you still trust him. Tris, you are an idiot. The plot is pretty bad, and the video recording is taken straight out of The Maze Runner. Both of these films are generic, and are almost indistinguishable from The Hunger Games, Maze Runner, and even Harry Potter. When will they come up with something original? This film is fun, no doubt about it, but it's not really worth it. Watch the Hunger Games instead.Is Insurgent an under-appreciated gem? Before we get started, let me say that I haven't read a book. I just don't read. This is something that bothers me heavily when people are enraged and dislike a movie simply because it wasn't loyal to a book or when movie feels jumbled and confusing simply because you haven't read a book and when you complain about it people say you should read the book. Movie is a movie, book is a book. One of the most common complaints I heard about this film is that it has too convoluted plot. It most definitely has a complex plot but at no point did I feel lost. I would go as far and say that if you got lost in the plot you probably haven't paid proper attention or simply switched your brain off, because I was entertained and thrilled through out the entire run time. Insurgent is the kind of movie that greatly benefits from being a sequel. We already had our characters set up in a first movie (Divergent). With origin story out of the way we can just have our characters being badass right out the gate. Easily the most interesting character is of course Tris, played amazingly by Shailene Woodley. She is the heart and soul holding this movie together. And as I said we saw her became badass in Divergent, now we can just have her awesome immediately and she even steps it up further. One of my favorite scene in the movie is when she stands trail at Candor and is forced to speak the truth. Her performance in that scene is just... flawless. But not just her performance, but also the editing, timing of the shots, pausing, just an amazing and brilliantly crafted sequence. It's scenes like this that really make you connect with her character. Overall she absolutely sells it as this emotionally broken girl who feels that she has to make things right even after having lost everything already. With all that praise for Shailene Woodley, I must admit that the rest of the cast, with exception of Theo James and Milles Teller from time to time, does feels like they are a bit bored. The two big names (Kate Winslet and Naomi Watts) while good don't really do much. Another concept that I loved is the sim test to open that box. (For the spoiler sake that is all I will say.) I love how Tris feels like she needs to do it because she feels responsible. Not to mention that that scene contains some phenomenal action sequences. Also early on in a film there is some excellent and of course very subtle foreshadowing for one of the sims. It's just little gems like this, some truly well crafted and filmed action sequences (no shaky cam, thank god) and just an incredible performance from Shailene Woodley that honestly lead me to believe that this movie is much more then just a quick YA novel to film cash grab adaptation, especially since as I said I haven't read the book so I can just watch the movie for what it is. I honestly would go as far and say that is better then the original and definitely better then Allegiant which is what inspired me to rewatch the first two and review Insurgent. Ulitmatly Insurgent is not without it's fair share of flaws but overall this is one of the better young adult films we got so far.Give me more Apparently there's a sex scene in Insurgent. It shows a little flesh, it's nicely shot and it's over very quickly.  For me that sums up Insurgent and the whole series really. It's nicely shot but it only ever offers glimpses into character and motive. And when the characters do talk you only get snippets of what's going on. In the end it leaves you wanting more.  The main character Tris is neither a leader nor someone struggling to come to terms with being divergent. She gives no great rallying speeches, she offers no great one liners of inspiration and hope, she mainly stares and runs. I'd love to know what's going on in her mind!  Once again, I'm left wanting more.Interesting I remember when I first read the books. The first one was interesting from the start, with the whole story-line of the fractions with all its diversity, and yet so single-minded. I liked all about the start of Triss first meeting with the dauntless, the trains and the jumping first and the weird friendships that formed under huge pressure.  So far, the first movie, Divergent, was following suit and I liked how the creators of the movie kept to the story of the book.  However, I think I lost interest in the middle of the movie, with all that fighting and screaming and it just kept going on...and on....  So I think I just forgot to watch the sequel, this one, Insurgent.  Surprise surprise, I liked it a whole lot more than I did the first one!  Apart from the fighting, where I went to the loo, or in to the kitchen to get something, I enjoyed. The story is so together in this one. It's all about Triss finally getting to open the box. Simple.  And then she opens it. And et voila - they all find out that the divergent are the important ones, that the whole thing has been an experiment from the world beyond. Etc.  Yeah. It held together well, and I enjoyed it. Not too much. Not too little. Just enough, you know? For wanting to see the sequel of this one.  MarianneInsurgent Review Insurgent(2015) Starring: Shaliene Woodley, Theo James, Miles Teller, Kate Winslet, Ansel Elgort, Naomi Watts, Maggie Q, Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, Zo√´ Kravitz, Octavia Spencer, Suki Waterhouse, Rosa Salazar, and Daniel Dae Kim Directed By: Robert Schwentke Review One Choice Can Destroy You You know i'm beginning to see a pattern with all of these dystopian young adult books. They have one good film in their series or no good films, so far with Hunger Games theirs one(catching Fire) and with this series it's zero and getting worse. That is quite disappointing given some of the talented actors I saw in this movie, and actors who have such potential but are in films that are just messy. The second chapter in the Divergent series sees Tris Prior where we left her, hiding in a faction called Animety or something like that. While Janeine(Winslet) has taken over the city and has ordered the dauntless to search for a special divergent to open some box that was found at the Prior home. As to why only one special Divergent can open the box the movie has no clue, no one divergent should be able to open the stupid thing, if only a divergent can open it, then any divergent should be able to, not just the chosen one or something. You know I actually walked out waiting for my mother to pick me up and some elder man asked "what was the moral?" and I wanted to answer better question "What was the point?" this movie is not fun, engaging, have a good story or resembles any awe or enjoyment so what was this film trying to accomplish. The performances may be good from some of the actors which is the only thing that saved the first film, and the only thing that is saving this film, but I hated this one more than the first one. I do not care or know about any of these characters. They are not likable, they are all a-holes. When Tris's brother try's to help her the first she just yells at him, Four just gets tough for no reason, Janeine is the villain so you probably won't like her because her motive sucks, and Miles Teller plays an a-hole. The film does not come all together in a well constructed formulaic fun or interesting picture it just comes off as an okay Michael Bay movie, the only difference is better acting. I'm giving Insurgent a one and a half out of five.Its so bad its funny First of all how come this Peter got from bad guy to their friend and he still screw them over , and when he got tris to the room with the machine Tris still didn't want to kill him , really , let the guy who screwed you 24/7 go  Second - 20 people cant shoot a single target , really , are they all blind ? , 20 5 year old would hit the target Tris , Four or Celeb  Third - why did this Celeb run from bullets of Jeanine so he can go to them without force , or did he just know that bullets don't go straight to the target or maybe false bullets , who knows  Fourth - So Jeanine can control their mind and all she does is make suicides , she can easily make them to bring Tris to her , its so simple  This is my opinion but if you listen to me you will not waste 2 hours watching a movie that insults your intelligencewatered down dystopian trash I did not particularly warm to the first film , but gave it the benefit of the doubt. My 18 year old daughter emphasized that these type of movies are simply not tailored to the taste of middle-aged gents, and sure she was right. The entire movie - save for some impressive CGI - feels like brewing a cup of coffee by hand having the filter fold and having a watered down cup of something as result. Plenty of action, but no suspense. There is simply no feeling the dystopian world itself exists outside the studio's interior and the heroine is just another big-eyed babe with made-belief toughness. These type of movies need rougher edges, real bad-ass opponents (Kate Winslet, give me a break) , a better pacing and less running around within studio's. Fortunately my 18 year old did appreciate the layered intensiveness of Minority Report, though still switch-tasking between movie and tablet. Insurgent just made me yawn..Awful movie, probably only good for fans. Awful movie, probably good for the fans, i'm surprised this franchise has fans.. Awful acting and directing, would defiantly not recommend it for anyone. You might as well go watch the matrix, because it is the copy of that, the only thing good in it is the CGI, thats what the whole movie consists off. Shailene Woodley's character wasn't even in it much, isn't her character the protagonist? Theo James Character was in it more than Tris. For the acting, there isn't any hype about it, shailene showed no emotion or anger, for theo james he was good, he showed everything that was needed. I would say that the movie is good for the fans but thats it. Its just as confusing as the first one for the non-book readers, but the books are suppose to be bad to.. Oh well I guess this is another flop movie for the divergent franchise.Surely it can't be worse than the first one? Oh... What's the main difference between Divergent and Insurgent you ask? With Divergent I got to heckle at the screen to my hearts content and shout profanities, because I was in the comfort of my own home. With Insurgent I was bound to socially acceptable behavior, since it was a free advance screening in a theater.  When I say this is a bad series, I truly mean that there is nothing worthwhile to be taken away from either movie. The 2nd installment continues the overly convoluted and utterly senseless plot that pits our heroine Tris (Shailene Woodley) against a poorly defined villain and conflict. She is even less believable as the 'brave', tough-as-nails caste member she's been so effortlessly been trying to become, and then suddenly she exhibits all the other redeemable qualities that defines her as 'Divergent'? And I thought Twilight was awful... This second installment centers around...well nothing in particular. It basically picks up where the first one left off and Tris and company have to 'get back at the Jeanine' - the out of place cartoon villain. There's some magical box that's introduced as the MacGuffin device which ultimately unravels the already fragmented narrative. Don't worry, the sequel adds a whole new level of plot-holes to the already ridiculous premise. Gee, all that futuristic tech that wasn't in the first film looks awfully familiar to another teen-girl-turned- heroine young adult series.  Characters? Development? Don't be preposterous! Those things don't exist in this movie. Just like the first film, you have painfully delivered dialogue that is more laughable than memorable. That forced romance from the first one? Yeah, you're just supposed to accept it in this one. (Sorry Four you're stuck with her for better or for worse).  Honestly the only redeemable part of this hackneyed and clich√©d movie is Miles Teller's character. He's seldom on screen and is only funny because he plays a total jerk. Let's hope no one notices that they're borrowing a lot of elements from other classic and popular dystopian stories. Logan's Run? That's about a marathon right? Nope, there are no isolated societies in Divergent/Insurgent. Hunger Games? No! This is a movie about an impractical futuristic society that segments parts society for the greater good. You must be mistaken. Oh wait... I made it through two and a half pitchers of beer, only drinking when there was something generally cringe-worthy on screen. See if you can beat my record (Drinking responsibly and in remedy of this movie of course) . The best part of the sequel? It's 20 minutes shorter than Divergent.  Read the full review and others like it on the Drive-In Zeppelin website!Insurgent turned me around on the books Veronica Roth, author of the Insurgent series, was one of the top-selling authors last year, with the Divergent series rarely out of the Amazon top ten. Of course, the films are going to do well on the back multi-million copy book sales. I wasn't a fan of the book series, having read them long before they became bestsellers. I found them a touch tedious and lacking pace, and I couldn't shake the feeling they were a copy of The Hunger Games. However, the films are an entirely other beast, in that they neatly condense the books, thus creating a far more exciting watch than a read (at least for me).  Even though these films haven't been on my must-see list, the latest episode Divergent has changed all that for me. It's an exciting mix of action, romance, and politics, well put together by the writers, and even if you haven't seen the first movie or read the books, you will still enjoy this thrilling ride.  The film opens throwing us right into the middle of the action, following on from Divergent. Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James) and the gang are now outlaws and on the run from Jeanine (Kate Winslet), leader of Erudite faction. They are holed up at Amity faction, where the code is to remain peaceful and forgiving. It doesn't take long for the small Dauntlet group to find themselves at odds with the nature of the Amity villagers and to be discovered by Eric (Jai Courtney) and the guards hunting them down on behalf of Jeanine.  Tris is, also, dealing with the guilt of the slaughter of her mother and her friends in the raid, which wiped out Tris's old faction, Abnegation. She discovers her mother was protecting a secret for which she was prepared to die; the same secret for which Jeanine will kill. A little more is revealed about Eric, which adds a twist to the story. Some old friends will betray Tris, but she will, also, find new allies. In Insurgent, the world is revealed as bigger than we imagined in Divergent, and you will be left panting for the next film.  This series has turned me around on the book series, and I now see why it's done so well. These are interesting characters and the angst and fight in Tris makes her a great protagonist. In fact, I don't think I can wait for next year's film Alligient (which incidentally is being split into two parts) to discover what happens; I may have to read the book. More reviews at http://www.susanmaywriter.complot sufffered for action 'divergent' was such a great movie because it properly balanced action with the story. it set everything up and engaged you, developing characters so you form a relationship with them, whether you love or hate them. 'insurgent' unfortunately, did not have that same balance. I wouldn't say I was bored, per say, but definitely had trouble following the point. I don't remember the details of the 'insurgent' book but i'm almost positive it was more entertaining than this. I also don't appreciate the break down of the four and tris relationship. they bickered a lot in the last two books, but there's also a lot of love there, and i didn't feel it much here except for in one totally Hollywood scene that contradicts the books. (you'll see what i'm talking about)sorry, holding hands everywhere doesn't count as cute moments for me. also, there was great dialogue and banter from the book i recognized NOWHERE. disappointing. if they hated the 2nd book so much, why bother making it a movie? they should have picked a screenwriter who actually enjoyed it.Hollywood's down the drain Let me begin by saying that I'm not a member of the 8-15 age demographic that this film targets, nor do I consume young adult fiction like the book upon which this film is based. So, I can't say whether this was a good screen adaption or not. I do like good movies worth re-watching though, and this film does not leave me wanting more. There is a good amount of filler, and a semblance of some padding out, though it has a weak storyline and some sub-par acting moments. In true 'tween form, the movie wants to explain away any fluff straightaway. Thinking's hard, huh? Let's also strip it of any creativity or ingenuity by merging it with today's pop culture fads...that way it will seem fresh without requiring any measurable intelligence. It's NOT a total stinker, I imagine it will be enjoyable for its' intended audience. My "inner film snob" wants to hunt down the original copy just so I can dump it in a port-o-potty.A bridge to nowhere "Bridges are perhaps the most invisible form of public architecture." - Bruce Jackson Walking into the cinema... The Hunger Games, The Giver and Maze Runner. Can this series differentiate itself from all of the other dystopian teen dramas? Overall rating: 2.5 stars Cinematic value: 2 stars Big questions value: 3 stars Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) is living a life under pressure. The pressures of tragedy, politics, and the expectations of all the people in her life. The realisation of her role in this seemingly utopian society and the need for a leadership change. Cracks have formed within and between the well formed structures of their society and war seems inevitable. Lines are drawn and loyalties are being determined as the sides prepare for battle. Aware of the repercussions of her decisions, Tris must move past her own emotions and she must consider her responsibilities amongst the chaos of a burgeoning world order. Could it be that she is the unifying factor to this fragile and fractured world? Insurgent is filled with societal considerations, such as forgiveness, identity, sacrifice and love. In finding her identity, Tris must come to terms with her divergence and how that will effect all who come into her life.  Much of Insurgent's action is set in the dry riverbed of the Chicago River. The iconic draw bridges are part of the Chicago landscape, but in this story these mighty expanses are useless. The drawbridges are set in the up position and are covered with vines. These bridges are a representation of this film on many levels. Firstly, the dystopian storyline leaves the audience stuck in the middle of this trilogy and it seems to serve no real purpose. Insurgent provides some connections to the next instalment and introduces some interesting twists, but in the end all it does is leave a yearning for the end of the story. Another similarity to the bridges has to deal with strength. In the first chapters of Divergent, the goal was to strengthen Tris and the other central characters. They experienced physical and mental training that built their stamina and ability to serve the society as the guardians. Insurgent strips away all of the virility and depth of the main characters. Tris and Four (Theo James) continue to have the ability to throw a punch and fire a gun, but they come off as weak and whiny. Four moves from a commanding presence to a love sick puppy. Tris lacks confidence and becomes boring as the central character. The only person with any charisma is Peter, played brilliantly by Miles Teller (Whiplash), who is a despicable opportunist. Yet, when he comes on screen, he adds the needed flavour to the scene. He lacks moral appeal, but inevitably adds a bit of adrenaline to a slow moving story. One key appealing element in the original Divergent story was the movement between the simulated world and reality, which added exceptional tension in the film. Even though the CGI effects have improved for this instalment, Insurgent demystifies this element and causes these portions to drag the story down, opposed to adding some needed action.  Insurgent does offer great themes for discussion, such as forgiveness, justice, truth and sacrifice. There was a fascinating depiction of judgement when Tris and Four are put on trial and shown great mercy. Then in the following scene they have to deliver justice in a situation with one of the Dauntless leaders. The moral dilemma makes for a fascinating philosophical consideration, but weighs heavy on the story. In the end, Insurgent felt like it had different intentions to Divergent. They include the same characters, but they seem to be taking themselves too seriously. Within the realm of teen inspired drama, this film was entertaining and was not surprising in its level of violence and adult themes. Yet director, Robert Schwentke seems to unnecessarily apply deep commentaries of society on a story line that is too weak to support the pressure. Ultimately, the bridge of the story cannot handle the additional weight and the film lacks purpose.  Leaving the cinema... Insurgent, like Mockingjay Part 1, was not a bad film and did the work to set up the next film and make millions of dollars in the process. There are interesting twists, but the story is slow going. If you are a fan, you will not be disappointed, but now you will need to wait until next year for the resolution.  Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. How will the world come to an end? (Matthew, 24:36, Revelation 20:1-15) 2. Should we rebel against bad leadership? (Romans 13:1-7, 1 Peter 2:13-17) 3. How can we overcome trauma? (1 Peter 5:7, Psalm 34:4) Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviewsA slower, solid, more action focused sequel.... Insurgent isn't a god awful second trip to the series, it just makes mistakes. This time the stakes are set higher, the action pumps up a notch and Ansel Elgort wipes his grin and gets in the fight. Robert Schwnetke's previous, R.I.P.D was a disaster, to make up for his bad film, Insurgent's brilliant direction. Woodley is absolutely amazing, Elgort, James and Winslet are fantastic as well. This time, the whole plot is cheesy, and filled with bad twists and turns. Divergent was a mediocre, rushed but well acted adaptation, and Insurgent keeps more of the same genes. Overall, this is a movie for fans only, I have read the book, and this is a solid adaptation if it weren't for the flaws. 6/10 ******Better Than the First "Insurgent" picks up right where the first film of this series "Divergent" left off. The tense peace inside the walls of dystopian Chicago is shattered when the Abnegation faction was invaded and destroyed. Tris and Four are rebels on the run, seeking refuge among the other factions. Ruthless Erudite leader Jeanine needs a perfect Divergent in order to unlock a certain box which contains an important message about their current existence, which Jeanine wants to suppress. This special Divergent is, of course, is Tris. The first film "Divergent" was a pretty good film interpretation of the book. I found this second film to be even better than the first film. I did not get to read the second book so I could not assess its faithfulness to the original material. We get to see better the rest of the other factions, like Amity (with Octavia Spencer as their leader Johanna), Candor (with Daniel Dae Kim as their leader Jack Kang), and the Factionless (with Naomi Watts as their leader Evelyn). I can see the same limitations of the first book here, especially with the unusual behavior and decisions of Tris, but hey, she is a special girl, the chosen one.  I thought Shailene Woodley did very well to play Tris, with her guilty conscience, disturbing nightmares and the reluctance as a heroine. Theo James though is less noticeable here than before, as Four is seemingly relegated to be Tris' consort in this installment. Ansel Elgort looked very ill at ease and awkward in his scenes as Tris' confused younger brother Caleb. Making more of an impact were Miles Teller as the snake- like turncoat Peter and Jai Courtney as the vicious Dauntless officer Eric. Kate Winslet owns every scene she is in with her strong screen presence. A new director Robert Schwentke (known for previous mainstream hits like "Flightplan" and "RED") took over from Neil Burger (who directed "Divergent"). Schwentke guides us through the criss-crossing web of events, building up effectively to the climactic five Faction simulation that Tris had to hurdle. The simulations in this film looked more sophisticated and complicated, with over-the-top visual effects, especially in that exciting Dauntless "sim" where Tris had to rescue her mom from a burning house hurtling in the air.  This film is rated PG, but there are pretty intense violent scenes, including point-blank shooting of defenseless people, and a character pointing a gun at his temple. There was also a scene which had the young kids around me uncomfortably covering their eyes showing prolonged kissing between the leads, with clothes being removed. I think this film fully satisfies expectations for a second episode of a franchise. It was visually grand with mind-blowing special effects. It stands very well on its own, even if you have not yet seen the first film. It tells a complete story, with a defined resolution of events. It ends with a cliffhanger which makes you anticipate the next film. The last book in the series "Allegiant", in true Hollywood style, will again be split into two parts to make more money. Schwentke is already on board to direct Part 1, due out next year already. 8/10.Darker, action packed sequel that feels like a closer This is not a disappointing sequel for me, I haven't read the books so I can judge the film on it's own. While the first movie needed to explain more things and spent a lot of time on what the Dauntless are about, this one shows some facets of other factions: Amity and (more interesting) Candor. Abnegation is virtually destroyed and Erudite is pretty much the enemy. I have always found this division between 5 factions what makes Divergent really interesting, besides the theme of not fitting in a system. Because those themes were already covered in the first part, most of the film shows either chasing, surrendering or attacking, but it does those things well. It's pretty much an action film and one that looks great. Once more, the lead character, though a very good actress, is not very believable when she floors men twice her size in hand to hand combat. Cutting her hair short for a more boyish appearance (Tris looks very girlie and wide eyed) cannot change that. Fortunately she is not too much of a Mary-Sue and has to accept some losses and show vulnerability. The movie clearly had a bigger budget and threw in a lot of neat special effects and spectacular sights. It was a pleasure to look at. I don't really care for fx that much but for a futuristic sci fi...design and visuals can be very important and they certainly didn't cut corners in that department. The movie can be very dark, much more so than the first installment, and both innocents and antagonists get killed without mercy. The ending of the film is however very positive, it feels almost like an end to the trilogy and it makes me curious what's next. This film is getting bashed on a bit too much. It's not brilliant, but neither are the Hunger Games (which were hardly original, considering ). It's aimed at a teen audience. And yet, the political structure and the societal order are much more interesting in the Divergent series. I found this film entertaining from beginning to end and it had some nice twists in store.Flashy Cover Up Last year's Divergent was a film that not even its skilled director or high ambitions could fix the problems of its source material. The sequel, Insurgent, is a way different movie, since it's now handled by someone who is known for stylishly dumb action films. The film has gone to that same direction as well. It can be both a good and a bad thing; it elevates the entertainment value, but also leads to a lot of ridiculous ideas. It's quite hard to call it a better film since it has lost the intriguing flavor of its predecessor, but many would call it more fun, but the YA genre has its own way of appreciating its viewers and this straightforward action movie approach would hardly be described as anything more than an impressive spectacle for these movies. For its credit, this movie has more plot than the first one. We get to see the heroes explore more places even though it no longer lingers in its innovative ideas. But for an easy pleasure, the pacing is swift and the action is constant, but the story still offers some themes worth seeking out; settling into Tris's trauma and behavioral issues, and then some social commentaries. The former is often played out with bombastic bad dream sequences while the latter is understated by making its conflict look like any generic corrupt governments. But the real trouble here is how both of its core and its action don't mix well together. Putting its serious situations next to a stylish action scene just makes it look silly as a whole. But it does have a clever additional climax, while preposterous, it still manages to somewhat resolve the arc of Tris. The new director is known for the mediocre RED movies and, y'know, R.I.P.D. His style definitely overpowers each scenario, but he does spare the same breathing room of the first movie when it comes to providing details. The action is just too absurd compared to the film's occasional gravity. Some might call it exciting, there is mild tension in some parts, but much of the priority is to make things look cool, which also glosses some supposedly grim moments, with snazzy CGI and cool swagger. The best strength of the film lies on the performances: Shailene Woodley still buys into her character. She exhibits Tris beyond to what is now written to the character. The villains have become the lesser of themselves, but that fact is indeed surpassed by their talents; with Kate Winslet giving a sense of humanity to the suddenly unreasonable Jeanine, while Miles Teller brings a measure of levity in Peter. Other great stars like Naomi Watts and Octavia Spencer are underused and yet brought an impact in their scenes. Insurgent is not a good movie, but the viewers might value it as one of the rare not-good young-adult movies that isn't boring. I mean many YAs are bad and dull, it almost becomes unbearable. This one however would only be bragged about its silliness and sometimes laughable choices that instead becomes a guilty pleasure. There are some cool action and all, but again this genre asks for something beyond spectacle and maybe sophisticated, and there were only few movies that got it right, so far. Because it's possible to get past by the romantic clich√©s or the same dystopian future/revolution tropes. The source material may not be that great, but it still considers some interesting things that a film adaptation could transcend, but the pretentious action really gets in the way and that doesn't necessarily justify its deeper potentials. It may be a popcorn entertainment, but if this was labeled as another action film, it would remain not diverged.A decent sequel to Divergent - but lacks something At first, let me make it clear that I really liked the first movie, Divergent. I had not been familiar with the books or the story so it was an amazing "utopia" for me.  In Insurgent, basically we get what we should expect from such a sequel: another two hours of 3D visual awesomeness and captivating storytelling, along with a lovable female main character played very well again by Shailene Woodley. And, of course, a well written screenplay with moral thoughts in the right moments. While watching, I could not help being deeply moved emotionally by the film. Like in Divergent, there are a lot of dreaming scenes and now they are extremely intense. All the time I was like really feeling everything what Tris felt, understanding her emotions perfectly, getting a little of her mental struggles. This part is well elaborated in the film. It makes you think that yes, this is the same with me. Yeah, I do have these same doubts when I have to make serious decisions in my own life. We are tested by life from time to time and it is not always an easy choice which way to follow: that of abnegation, amity, candor, dauntlessness, or erudition. This time, we get a deeper insight in the life and mental constitution of all the factions. However, I must say I was not fully satisfied with the film. Apart from Tris, other characters are too one-sided, predictable and not well elaborated. The only interesting character among the others is Jeanine's (Kate Winslet), but I think her motives, her way of thinking should have been presented more detailed. After the first film, it was a big question for me what her story is, her character had so much potential, but I think the writers did not make use of it at all. Luckily, Kate Winslet is an amazing actress who is always able to give a remarkable performance. One day, maybe, Shailene will become a fine actress too, I will wait for that. It will be a lot of work for her, but she is a bright talent. Aww, but it is a pity that they cut her beautiful hair short for the movie! All in all, Insurgent is a must-see if you liked Divergent and a good follow-up to it, but only gives you what you "should" expect instead of what you really expect.Great Movie I loved the first movie and I loved Insurgent even more. I love the actors and actresses, they all are new faces with talent. Also there is experienced stars like Kate Winslet. I must tell, I never thought she would play a villain role perfectly. You can absolutely feel the hatred. Also, it was great that they include love between a daughter and mother. Most of the movies include love between two lovers but never talk about family love. It was sad that Caleb was willing to sacrifice her sister for his ideals. I didn't read the books so I don't know if the movie seems not good enough (I think it happens for every single book) but there was nothing I would like to change about the movie. Not a scene, not a line, NOTHING. When I watch a movie, even though I enjoy it I always think there is that one scene that should not be in the movie or should be in a different way but not for this one. I absolutely recommend it if you like sci-fi movies.Very crappy if your read the book There box in the book i don't why it was even in there I just added more confusion. Next her hair cut was awful ( I know fault in our stars) she could've kept the wig from the beginning of the movie. Next they barely include side characters ( Christina, hector, etc ) don't expect anything from the book. Jeanine doesn't get killed by Evelyn but by tori. What is sad is that Peter and Eric were my actors. Then all start randomly running towards the fence after as if they are all gonna get out ( which doesn't happen ). Then the Jeanines army randomly go in amity in the beginning. With barely any Marcus. Evelyn standing ON THE SIDE STALKING FOUR . it is a good movie if u haven't read the book. But if u reach the book you are screwed.
Drowned out by mixed reviews from people expecting gold and can't appreciate really good silver. If you stopped for an hour and dissected this film you WILL find problems, like how the audience is meant to root for borderline sociopathic criminals or how the structure isn't what they're used to... HOWEVER, if you go in just expecting to be entertained and if you have a particular fondness for hustle movies, this is one enjoyable movie. The charming but not over-the-top humour consistently keeps the story entertaining and by not following the usual structure of a movie this kind, and ultimately the one the trailer promised, it offers something new to the mix. I can see the multiple twists as a turn off for some expecting a deeper film but if you know what you're in for I think the multiple twists in the film's final act will one-after-another bring a smile to your face and even have you laughing. Will Smith harnesses his charm to success in this flick and Margot has effectively proved herself as not being a one-hit-wonder. This is not a bad film, though I do believe your enjoyment hinges on your expectations when going into it. Don't expect the next Ocean's 11, expect a charming, funny, well acted, smartly written, hustle movie that will undoubtedly be drowned out by mixed reviews from people expecting gold and can't appreciate really good silver.Well centered but unintelligent in approach The title "Focus" had potential among the quantitatively declining Con- Artist genre. Although brilliantly centered and set up with a decent cast and setting - the execution of intelligent criminal activity was poor and often justifying or explaining trickery and illusion as "he's just so good at it." - failing to satisfy the audience with an insight into the brilliance that is a con-centered plan.  I love heist movies. I love intricate con movies. I love crime movies and I'm sad to say this doesn't really come close to fitting anywhere between those genres best and brightest. Instead you're left feeling slightly amused, slightly tired, slightly relieved that it's over but kind of happy you saw it anyway - I dread to think how badly this movie would have been were it not for will smith.Never drop the con. Focus is a con movie and it's at its best when it's trying to con you into believing you know what is going to happen. The plot unfolds at a steady pace and you are left guessing what is going to follow. There are many twists and it's hard to keep up, as you would expect.  The regular cons work best in the first half, when the movie is trying to be fun and entertaining. During the second half of the movie the plot deepens and works around character development. That's when Will Smith and Margot Robbie come to life, they are at their best when they are given more to work with and they keep the movie interesting. However the movie gets caught juggling too many cons which by the end of the movie may feel just a bit flat; but still make for an unexpected and enjoyable finale.  Definitely worth watching. PS. The directors did a good job showing the importance of FOCUS in keeping the camera Focused at the right place.Smith redemption movie works but lacks refinement The Will Smith redemption movie, Focus, was a bit of a step up from After Earth. He could honestly only go up following After Earth.  Focus is a better movie than I anticipated, actually that's a lie. Despite the cast my expectations were low, so I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't much of a stinker. The movie is entertaining, the story is somewhat interesting, but - of course there is a but - it could have been much better. My main problem with Focus is that I wasn't engaged in the story, it wasn't because it's poorly written, it's not. I walked into the movie theater knowing that it was about con-artists - the marketing never hid it, if you've seen the trailer you know this. Anyway, knowing that it was about con artists and the tag-line is "Never loose Focus" I never really let my guard down and I didn't let myself believe what I was seeing. I was busy trying to figure out what the con was before it happened and that's where the movie kind of disappoint. They did not play on the fact that the audience may be looking for clues as to what is going on. There are no real clues for the audience to find, there are very little things for you to think back on and say "That's right I saw that." They either show how it or explain it once it already happened. So if you're like me, looking for bread crumbs for you to figure out the con Focus hardly leaves any. I only got sucked into one scene and totally believed what they fed me for a little while. But much later when the big twist came I wasn't shock or surprised. I probably would have had a better experience of the film if there were hidden clues leading up to the cons or if there was one character, who wasn't a con artist, that I could have trusted allowing me to let my guard down and get conned. The leads, Will Smith and Margot Robbie, work well on screen. Will Smith is not his usual happy, upbeat, self in this movie but it suits the character. As for Margot Robbie, she plays the sex symbol clich√© well without letting herself get trapped by it. She's more than a dumb, interchangeable pin up, she showed it in The Wolf Of Wall Street and also in interviews you quickly get that she knows how and when to wield the power than she has. She's talented and it shows in the movie.  Focus is a decent movie, it lacks refinement but it's entertaining, Smith is slowly getting back on top after the stinker that After Earth was.A confused film, avoid it. I couldn't quite figure out what kind of caper movie Focus is trying to be. If it was a light comedy in the vein of Oceans, The Sting, or The Italian Job then the tone of the film is completely wrong. The cast try to be light, fluffy and likable. There is a smattering of sexual tension, which seems very forced. But the characters aren't funny and you can't empathise with them. They steal from ordinary people and relish that fact, referring to victims as 'suckers'. OK then, this must be a serious caper movie in the vein of The Grifters? The kind of caper movie where you're supposed to hate the lead characters and everyone comes to a sticky end? Well, no. The film just isn't bleak enough. Largely absent are gratuitous lashings of realistic violence; overly profane language and there are no dark overtones. When we finally come to the consequence of the lead characters actions it's a weak conclusion. What did our character learn from his journey? Spiritual enlightenment? That crime doesn't pay? No, only that he should never lose 'focus'. Seriously, that's it!? Don't ever get me started on the plot. The whole movie is a gigantic mess. Avoid it at all costs.The Only People Getting Conned Are the Audience No one had heard of Margot Robbie until 'The Wolf of Wall Street' came about. Now, it seems that every Director wants her in their film. How could they not; when she enthralled audiences everywhere with an exceedingly rare female role in a film. A character that is determined and strong willed. Don't get me wrong Robbie is entitled to further roles, I just cannot shake off the feeling that the Directors pulled off a con involving her, so that she could become the female lead in 'Focus'. It should be noted that never has a title had less relevance for a feature film. Because if anything the majority of this film is out of focus and you can include the script in that statement as well. It's not all bad though. The first thirty minutes is entertaining. However, I mean this in a, if you leave your brain at home way. Don't think too much and you may have a blast, but that's only if you never use your brain during a film. If you do, then there's the door, I suggest you walk through it. Nicky is a con artist played blandly yet again by Will Smith, who has only ever been well cast in a film once ‚Äì 'Men in Black'. He takes up Jess played by Margot Robbie mustering her acting talent and trying as hard as she did in 'The Wolf of Wall Street' to impress. She becomes his prot√©g√©, con artist and lover. They try to become romantically involved and it does not work out. Nicky eventually tracks her down to win back her affection and talent as a con artist. Unfortunately, cracks in the film appear frequently, too large to brush aside and ignore. Consider the opening scene where Nicky tries to bed Jess. It works to his advantage and all of it happens according to his plan. But, we as an audience do not buy it. He barely knows the girl and not five minutes of chit chat has taken place, when they decide to get down to business. I know he is Will Smith and all. I'm sure he has women falling at his feet. But this seems rather far-fetched. Especially when this love turns out to be more than a one night stand and they are fully fledged romantically. The decisions that they partake seem rash, perhaps it was this lack of character development that led me to become distanced from the film in the process. The script thinks it's very clever and is far too cock sure. This brings to mind another film about deception, trickery and cons. That made no sense at all in the slightest and was all too lacking when it came to character motivation and plausibility. 'Now You See Me'. Both of these films are firmly rooted in the nineties, with old jokes and plot twists so dumb it would have a toddler second guessing the events of the film. Another comparison to be made is that they both possess visual gleam. Take that away and they are just cheap parlour tricks to conceal their true identity. If I am putting my points across to you again and again, then I'm sorry. But at least it parallels the repetitiveness of the film itself. What starts out as clever movements of characters who steal wallets and other personal belongings from random citizens grows tiresome quickly. Seen one con and you have seen them all. Don't get me going again about the romance that has been stamped on so that couples will flock to the cinema. Do we ever feel involved in their emotions? Do we feel for the characters? Do we in fact buy their romance at all for a second? The answer to all of them above is a definite no! The con clearly is on with 'Focus', not on the oblivious characters, but by and large on the audience themselves. How long can you watch the same old, same old trickery on screen that never changes? It drags and drags and drags. Gets old quickly see? Want a dull Will Smith? A flavourless story? Dumb plot twists that make no sense for a climax? You can have it all. Just do not expect witty dialogue, engaging scenes or interesting characters for that matter. Now excuse me while I burn all copies of the film.Brilliant con artist movie blended with flawed romantic comedy "Focus" blends two different movies in roughly equal measure. One is a movie about con men, scam artists and hustlers, in the tradition of "The Sting," "Ocean's Eleven," "House of Games" and "Shade." The second movie is a romantic comedy between two people who are strongly attracted to one another, but who cannot and do not trust each other.  The movie about con men is brilliant. The hustles and scams are clever and cleverly executed with excellent skill and tradecraft. Dramatically, the double-blinds and double- crosses are well executed. The players con their marks, one another and the audience with finesse and aplomb. The cinematography, choreography and editing are crisp. The reveals are plausible within the film's cosmos of reality.  The romantic comedy is not bad. One can understand and believe the attraction between the two characters. Will Smith's character is hunky, clever, confident, successful and wealthy. Margot Robbie's character is gorgeous, sexy, vulnerable, clever and charming. But the major plot points in this boy finds girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl back subplot seem contrived, while the intriguing aspect of their relationship (How can two con artists with a history of deceiving one another learn to trust one another?) isn't explored in a satisfactory manner. Instead we get a breakup for reasons that are never explained, a repeated gag involving a wallet, and a massive coincidence that leads the audience to believe one of them has a hidden agenda involving the other. The relationship between them works best when they are conning one another, but it needs resolution.  Technically, the film is beautifully done. Cinematography, locations, wardrobe, make-up, editing, audio -- everything is polished. It's a movie that merits a second or third viewing, not only to see the cons played out, but also to appreciate some of the subtle foreshadowing."Never lose Focus" You know a movie is bad when it doesn't even follow it's tagline.  Unfortunately, this is the case in Focus, a disjointed, needlessly convoluted misfire from directors Glenn Ficarra and John Request and a talented cast that includes Margot Robbie and Will Smith.  Focus starts relatively well, displaying many cool scenes of pickpocketing as Smith tries to lure Robbie into the business. However, soon all of this turns out to be a distraction of the real plot, that is the big time con, which is an absolute letdown.  There is plenty of filler in the middle, particularly a clever but ultimately pointless 20 minute scene at an American football match. While it is impressive to watch, it doesn't contribute anything to the plot.  Soon, they move on to the next big con which is completely unrelated to the last (that shows how useless the start was) full of ever more filler, more deception, more forced humour and more lame twists.  The third act is a disaster with the plot double or should I say, triple crossing itself like a spider's web on a spider's web on a spider's web. Nothing is clear and the explanations are given vaguely and lamely. There is more humour that doesn't work again in the end.  Will Smith is lazy as the main lead and Margot Robbie is functional as his love interest / sidekick. The side characters are all equally functional and forgettable.  Overall, Focus is a terrible con movie which cons the audience with it's good trailer and impressive cast, which can't save this convoluted mess from it's filler filled plot.The Sting This Ain't Let this movie serve as a cautionary tale for dummies who want to make a con artist movie‚ÄîDon't. You are out of your depth.  This movie made no sense. The romance in it made no emotional sense and was not set up properly. The twist was obvious, and made no sense. See instead: The Grifters, The Sting, House of Games, Oceans Eleven, The Spanish Prisoner, Film Flam Man, Match Stick Men. Whoever in New Orleans agreed to have this shot there did not read the script. It portrays New Orleans as the leading American city in which to get your valuables jacked. If you believe someone could pull your wedding ring off your finger without you noticing it, you will maybe like this film. If you still insist on seeing this, check your logic at the door or be prepared to be angry. Don't say you weren't warned.Badly executed I watched the first 40min and was already bored, what was supposed to be a fun introduction was sadly uneventful. The most exciting scenes weren't all that exciting. Plot was to say the least confusing. He rejects her and gives her the money, she is devastated. Next he sees her during a job, she rejects him, he is chasing her, without any explanation, suddenly Nicky is madly in love with her and there was no indication of that whatsoever.Also Nickey completely forgets about a big job he is supposed to do. And that only makes sense because he is not good at 'expressing his feelings'. In the end, they are together and in love and have forgiven each other everything. Really confusing. I found myself forwarding trough some scenes after that first 40min. I usually watch every minute of every film i start , even bad ones but not this one. I love Will Smith but this was disappointing. It needs more thrill, action and a plot that makes sense. Not recommending this at all.Unsatisfying movie with Unclever Forced Twists. Just watched "Focus", a movie which made some buzz 2-3 years ago mainly because the rumored romance between the two main actors, Will Smith and Margot Robbie. I don't know what they actually did off-screen, but on-screen they have no chemistry at all. Focus is a movie about con-artists. It doesn't try to follow the steps of "The Sting" or "Ocean's eleven", but it has the same goal, to confuse the audience on who is playing who... and here is where the problems are starting to arise... The plot is paper thin and every con seems unnecessary and overcomplicated. There aren't that too many cons to begin with, but every one of them seems forced. A futile effort from the writers, to "amaze" the audience. You see, to make the audience to expect a twist is basically a bad thing. Even the average viewer had, possibly, better twists in mind than those in "Focus". More plausible and more fun to watch. Here the tricks are too over-the-top in their execution to swallow, and overall unimpressive, leaving a bad aftertaste... The movie looks colorful, but the acting is pale. Will Smith seems bored possibly because of an early realization that this movie won't work. Overall: Not a satisfying movie, including the lukewarm ending. The twists you expecting from a con-artist's movie are there, but they are unclever and forced. Maybe its time to dust that DVD of "The Sting" from the selves... .A clever film with a few twists Not really sure how this film has got some poor reviews. It was clever, funny and overall kept my focus (Pardon the pun). Will Smith is fantastic in this film, not being an over-exuberant character, which I feel some people were expecting in this film. His on screen relationship with Margot Robbie was very good, and I feel she has not got as much credit for this film as she deserves.  Some fantastic camera shots, and great locations add a little bit extra to this film. I would advise not listening to reviews and going to see it for yourself and making the decision on your own. Enjoy!A fun way to kill time. Focus tells the story of Nicky(Will Smith), who is a conman. Nicky takes a woman named Jess(Margot Robbie), under his wing. He teaches her all about conning people. Eventually, they go their separate ways. A few years later, when Nicky is trying to pull off his latest conning scheme, Jess shows up. This makes Nicky's plans go haywire.  Focus is an entertaining movie. All the set pieces in the film where Nicky &amp; his team, con people in various ways are an absolute delight to watch. The scene at the football match is one of the most unpredictable sequences in the movie. I liked the fact that the makers of the film showed us the downsides of conning &amp; not just the upsides of it. The highlight of the film is the electrifying chemistry between Will Smith &amp; Margot Robbie. Smith &amp; Robbie look very natural as an on screen couple &amp; they seem to enjoy each other's company. They must have had a blast making this movie. Will Smith is brilliant as Nicky. Smith exudes charm &amp; panache as the title character. Margot Robbie is great as Jess. Robbie looks gorgeous &amp; delivers another good performance after her role in The Wolf of Wall Street. Adrian Martinez is hilarious as Farhad. Gerald McRaney is spectacular as Owens. Rodrigo Santoro is good as Garriga. BD Wong is impressive as Liyuan. The supporting characters are effective too. Focus is not a must watch in theaters. However, watch it if you are free &amp; want to watch an awesome movie with firecracker chemistry between Will Smith &amp; Margot Robbie.Loss of time Complete loss of time. Good actors won't save such a bad story. No wonder the movie could barely paid production costs, by the way too expensive for what was presented. Nothing at all to remember but the scenes with Margot in bikinis. Really impressed how movie distributors can go along trying to push some movie like that into the market. Will Smith only resembles himself on this movie and Margot does what she can , be a bimbo girl. This is a bad film and I do believe your enjoyment hinges even more on your expectations when going into it Good actors, not acting that well here and that is all.Focus looks great but ends up being ultimately forgettable I was lucky enough to catch an early preview of Focus last night. I must say, the film surpassed many of my already low expectations of the film. Despite this plus, the film never really has that WOW factor to it. Written and Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Reque, the same duo behind Crazy, Stupid Love, Focus feels more like a love letter to Steven Soderbergh than a film that can stand on its own two feet. Much like its inspirations, Focus aspires to be a great film and almost succeeds but the difference between Focus and films such as Ocean's Eleven and The Grifters is that this ends up feeling like it is trying too hard to wear its inspirations on it sleeve rather than be its own beast. Following Nicky, a brilliant con man and Jess, his sultry apprentice, as they fall in love all while trying achieve the perfect con, the story is decent enough to warrant a feature film but executed really poorly. Lets be honest here, there are no shortage of films very similar to this but what sets Focus apart from the rest is its sleek look. The look of this film is intoxicating, every shot is crisp and clear but also has a constant cloud over it all, as if the murkiness of these characters are affecting their environment. I'm sure there is a sub text to it all, its a shame the film isn't as cool as it looks because if it were, this really could have been something. The performances here are merely OK. Will Smith feels like a miscast here. The role of Nicky feels more like an Idris Elba type, a bit more suave and skinnier. Will Smith feels one step behind the entire cast when he really should at least try and act as if he is ahead of the curve. Margot Robbie is good but she is merely rehashing her sultry goddess performance from The Wolf of Wall Street minus the Brooklyn accent, adding very little substance to Jess and making her merely something nice to look at which is really troublesome considering Jess is probably the best character in the film. It made me wish Ficarra and Reque wrote the film around her rather than Nicky. But in the end, after their worlds collide, there's very little to take away from it all and the story plays out with a slight twist and a turn but nothing really surprising or original. Overall, Focus benefits from its sleek and sexy look but fails to deliver a good con man film, instead it delivers a lackluster romance film surrounded by crime elements that just don't really clickremember when Will Smith was a star? Remember when Will Smith was a star? oh yeah he was never a superstar-just a wannabe,i actually thought he got robbed at the Oscars,concussion was a very good movie, eexcept for the chase scene which never happened ) but back to this crappy movie,focus.well it appears that time has passed.this is one of the worst pile of crap I have seen actually put me to sleep , it is a copy of so many other films in this genre.take a almost leading man add a buxom blond and con someone. well there you have it. this movie is a total waste of time , rent one of the ocean movies or some movie along this line.will smith was a star ,he had a good following then the last few years took place,his choice of roles was more about the again if you knew here taste in movies you would understand just how bad this movie is ,it amazes me how people on this site give some really terrible movies good marks,are we settling for this?i watch over 200 movies a year and well very few are great I have learn to enjoy a lot of bad movies in some ways ,but this is not good -don't waste your money!!! ,I personally thought it was crap.the plot stunk -the acting is dismal, the directing and writing are 3rd gradish.1 starDon't understand how reviews from here give this so much hate- giving a 10 to drown out these atrocious scores. Don't let these narcissistic people influence your decision to go watch this movie. This was a great, thrilling movie that keeps you interested and entailed till the very end. These "experts" try to divulge into this movie so bad trying to nitpick at every crack, that they simply forgot the ability to actually "get into" a movie. To be with the movie with every scene occurring- occurs within you. This is not a sensation like one from interstellar, (which is definitely in my top movies) but the feeling I get from this is more similar to my feeling with "Rush." Completely different movies- yes, but this movie has the same feeling of ecstasy and will *figuratively* be sending you through twists and turns. It was a very pleasant watch, and if it wasn't for all these idiotic reviews my honest review would probably be a very strong 7- mediocre 8. See this one for yourself and you'll be walking out of the theater satisfied shaking your head and balking at how someone could possibly give this movie a 2- a 5- a 3. Just a disservice.Waste of time I went to this movie knowing nothing about it, we have planned to see other movie with my date, but when we arrived at the multiplex, that movie has sold out, so we choose this one. Basically we have here Will Smith (one of the most unbearable actors working today, he's impossibly smug in this) as a kind of criminal mastermind, a sort of CEO of an underworld company, always ahead of what others are thinking. He takes as an intern the blonde bombshell Jess (Margot Robbie, from the Wolf of Wall Street, playing again a groupie of a criminal). The movie's running joke is that the Smith character always ends up fooling her. In general, I don't like very much movies about criminals, since I don't find criminality to be very amusing. This movie, however, is too silly, too stupid, the absurd plot twists too ridiculous to offend. But it is really a waste of time to spend two hours of your life seeing this. And the movie is infused in a lot of what I find about US young urban contemporary culture to be abhorrent. The last part of the movie was filmed in my hometown, Buenos Aires (gratuitously so, since it involves a con operation involving a Formula 1 race, which hasn't been set here for many years), but even that part I didn't find to be terribly interesting, as it's all shown with a tourist lens. The only good scene in the movie here has Smith playing a game of escalating bets with a Chinese businessman (BD Wong).Requiem for Mr. Smith The plot of Focus is predictable, the characters shallow, stereotyped and banal, but the unpardonable sin; Focus is not interesting.  I like Will Smith and have enjoyed many of his movies, but there are limitations. The most evident limitation is that he needs at least an average co-star as his counterpart. In other words, even his broad shoulders cannot carry the entire weight of a movie successfully. Mr. Smith, like most mortals, needs a modicum of assistance for success. Mr. Smith is not entirely innocent is the disappointment that is Focus, but while lackluster, his performance is satisfactory and based on previous performances, his talent for clever and lusty scenes is unquestioned. The responsibility, for this cinematic failure, lies at the feet of sloppy writing and boring casting. Margot Robbie's performance was uninspired. Her one dimensional, mean sorority girl persona, lacked passion. The bedroom scenes between Ms. Robbie and Mr. Smith were common, at best. It must be assumed that her inability to reach any depth of character was overlooked, because of standardized, unoriginal beauty.  Focus is not worth watching, save your money and your time.Full of swagger... and convoluted plot twists. If ever there was a movie that should use LMFAO's "I'm Sexy and I Know It" as its theme song, this is it. Full of swagger and sizzle, this glossy thriller amps up the sex appeal all the way to boiling hot, even when the other cinematic elements can't quite keep up. What stops this from becoming 2015's Thomas Crowne Affair (the racy McQueen / Dunaway original, not the ho-hum Brosnan / Russo remake) is the convoluted script from Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who also take on directing duties. Their con-within-a-con-within-a-con plot is so cumbersome and complicated that the last act becomes a slog to get through. The nonsensical finale all but confirming just how far the twisted storyline had spiralled out of the filmmaker's control. Yet for all of its narrative flaws ‚Äì which also includes an abundance of con-artist clich√©s ‚Äì there is still an enthusiasm and seductiveness to the proceedings that primarily keeps it fun. There are a few amusing sleight of hand sequences, a streak of raunchy humour, and an abundance of only-in-our-wildest-dreams glitz and glamour that successfully adheres to the tried and tested formula of the genre. And then, of course, you also have the ridiculously attractive leading duo of Will Smith and Margot Robbie, together sharing a saucy chemistry in a relationship that sees the power dynamic continuously ebb and flow between them. A more, umm, focused screenplay could have leant the film a lasting influence, as is Focus offers enjoyable in-the-moment popcorn thrills that will be quickly forgotten.The charming Fresh Prince cons us into liking it! Going into it, I was not sure if I wanted to see a movie with big Willie not saving the world, but who better than Mr. Smith to prove that he does not need to battle aliens from outer space to make a blockbuster. He is the blockbuster, and though his last movie, After Earth was a failed lesson in movie stardom for little Jayden, Will Smith makes a comeback as a charming con man who falls for a up and coming con girl and needs to stay focus on keeping the con. It's All about Will's star power as he shows the world how well he's aged and that he's still got the charisma to fill theater seats, and he does. Getting my lips off Will's butt for a second, the movie in itself was charming and cleaver. The art direction was very stylish. Everything was made to look very sleek and sexy. Although, Will's eye candy, Margot Robbie did not need much help in the sexy category. So the movie can hold it's own with a sophisticated story of the art of the con game, that was more interesting and less predictable than most movies about the subject, but it does not hurt that this is Will Smith's vehicle, as he proves he's still got what it takes behind the wheel. Definitely ago see.A Nicely Manicured Bad Movie Focus is a very well put together movie. The acting is good. The cinematography is excellent. The costumes, sound, production etc. are all top class. The lead actors are beautiful, and we see enough of both of them to satisfy any gender preference. The problem is the script. It is just plain ... bad. It's predictable and relies on the same clich√©s throughout. The result is, it's disappointing and the end is, frankly, ridiculous. I'm all about suspending belief while watching a movie, but this is a 'con' movie, not a fantasy movie. Overall, I would say that it's reasonable escapism and worth 105mins of your time. But, wait until you can either see it at a 'cheap' cinema or the DVD has been reduced - which probably won't take long.Snore-Fest I felt like we were watching a remake of an average movie The cinematography was beautiful. The locations, the sets, the wardrobes,  the sound, the lighting (very Good), the supporting cast...all was very  good. The story (which should be thee MOST important thing) was very  average. The Chemistry between the leads was non-existent. It was obvious  that they were trying to create an obvious lack of heat. That killed the  film. Two usually very good actors, were forced to create an unusually  strained and uncomfortable relationship, that didn't ring true for a  second, on the big screen.Fun, entertaining, and well made -Focus (2015) movie review: -Focus is a crime flick that follows con-man Nicky, played by Will Smith, as he meets and trains a new counterpart Jess, played by Margot Robbie, in the ways of being a con-artist. This comes complete with twists, trust issues, rich people, and all kinds of Oceans 11 style problems. -For what it was, I really enjoyed Focus. It has a few small problems, but was good. -The story felt original and was hard to predict, making the twists even better and more shocking. Even if they were a tiny bit forced. -The pace was really good for the first half, and the second half. But the first half is all fun and the second half is all plot. Neither was bad, but the second half was less fun. -The acting is really good. Both Will and Margot did a great job! -The characters are deep and interesting. Will Smiths character especially had a lot to offer in the way of charisma and twists. -The music was fitting and some of it was memorable. -Another thing I liked was seeing the inside of the whole con-man thing you see in movies. Like stealing watches looks so much cooler in this because they explain it. -Really the negatives are small. There are some inconsistencies and some added drama that takes the audience out of reality alittle, but it was compelling, well-made, and entertaining! There is not that much else to say, because Focus is worth seeing in theaters! -It is rated-R for some language, a moderate, but not heavy amount, and some brief sexual content. A PG-13 amount probably.real stinker, avoid this movie Poorly written, same clich√© con movies as others. Poor acting, they needed a better supporting actress, Margot Robbie is eye candy only. This movie is slow, don't waste your time. I wished Will Smith would have passed on this one. Horrible, horrible music set to this movie. If you want a good snooze then this is your movie, so slow it would put an insomniac to sleep. I got in for free and still couldn't sit through it and walked out. Wow just when you thought Will Smith couldn't do a worse movie than, The pursuit of Happiness, he does this movie. This movie sucks, crap, the writer should be shot. Everything about this movie was poor and I cant reiterate enough on how you should stay away from this one.Focus actor I really would like to give you my review about the part BD Wong played in the movie Focus, and I hope you will place it on IMDb.com for everybody to read. As a partly Surinam/partly Dutch 50 year old woman and absolute filmfan, living in the Netherlands, I have seen quite a lot of movies, mainstream or not, documentary, art-house movies, it doesn't matter, I find almost everything interesting. Two years ago, 2015, I've seen about 300 movies, if not more . . . In the movie "Focus" all elements were superb : the script, the actors, the director, the cameracrew and the music. It was one big, beautiful symphony, like perfectly braided hair. AND in particular, I have never ‚Äì and I mean NEVER EVER ‚Äì seen a greater star shine in his role than BD Wong did in the movie "Focus"!!! He plays a dandy, deadserious yet humorous Asian gambler, a business man with too much money to spend , too much free time apparently to spend it, and nobody to stop him from acting like a child when he doesn't get what he wants and setting him straight when crossing the line. I say BD Wong outplayed everybody in this movie, even Will Smith and Margot Robbie, who acted great also and shared some sort of rare chemistry, seldom seen, like between Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. But BD Wong outshines them all. I mean, he got his 15 minutes to play and by God, did he play! He deserves an Oscar for this role because you don't see BD Wong, but you see only his character, Liyuan, and I think not even the script writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa could have dreamt of a better performer than actor BD Wong for this small yet utterly well played part. (together with a defining good choice of music and camera shooting angles).  In Holland (and France), when somebody excels so greatly, we say "Chapeau!". So here's to my new movie hero, whose beautiful voice I also LOVED in "Mulan", mister BD Wong : Chapeau!Really good film.. In the midst of veteran con man Nicky's latest scheme, a woman from his past - now an accomplished femme fatale - shows up and throws his plans for a loop. The first time i saw Focus i absolutely hated it but as it turned out the 2nd time was the charm the movie was awesome really funny and 2 great leading performances by Will Smith and Margot Robbie and it really doesn't surprise me that they worked again in Suicide Squad and they had such a great chemistry. This movie has a long backstory it was originally going to star Ben Affleck and Kristen Stewart but they both dropped out but i think one way or another the movie would be really great. It does have flaws tho with the ending a bit that i won't spoil but still a pretty great movie 9/10.Not Bad but not great This was an OK film that was worth watching. I love films about cons and scams so I enjoyed most of what went on. The pickpocket scenes were very well done and the actors obviously must have put in a lot of time to get these right. However the last 2 scams were disappointing. Picking a number scam if OK but no one in their right mind would gamble so much on what is a pretty flaky scam. And the final twist was way too risky, the Will Smith character could have easily died and his Father taking everything? Really? That said the acting and pace of this film were good especially the Margot Robbie character Jess. Will Smith is as usual good enough. This could be a TV series except it has already been done in Hustle and the American equivalent that I cannot think of right now.An Entertaining "Con" Movie with a Lot of Flaws The film has the feel of a "Con" movie that really plays more upon the emotions than upon reality. Will Smith's character relies upon rather dubious techniques to win big gains. In real life, those "Cons" place a lot more of the risk upon the played, rather than the player. Even at the very end, at the climax of the final scam, the entire Con depends upon a shot from a handgun being placed between the 3rd and the 4th rib, or something like that. Margot Robbie turns in another stellar performance in this film, not long after "The Wolf of Wall Street". It was nice to see Gerald McRaney, in true "Major Dad" form, back in action as well. All in all, the film was fun to watch, but had a manufactured and unbelievable plot.Always keep focus. *** May contain strong spoilers *** I like Will Smith. He has such a good laugh and presence. "Focus" is a piece of a professional entertainment playing in the step below the big league. The piece starts off with recognizable topics and characters, just to spin off in another direction... or is it? The research of the criminals, the characters, the personalities and the psychological issues behind the story is solid. Could have been even more; as it is it is good enough. One character in the movie is a big foreigner that comes with the most hysterical "I am honest and straight forward just to confuse you"- type of guy. Great! The question that comes through the screen and lands in the knee of the observer is as follows; who is who, and who is really who...?  Summary: A good story with twists and roll-overs. A while, there were too much of a regular "rip-off criminal movie". Will Smith is good, so are the other actors. Farhad; laughs! 6,8 out of 10Charming Con Artists If there is one thing that this dark comedy thriller Focus delivered to its viewers,it is the presence of its charming lead stars in Will Smith and Margot Robbie.Without these stars,the film would have fallen flat especially on the latter part wherein the story was unbearable especially when the Will Smith character Nicky "Mellow" Spurgeon simply into a bad guy who use anyone for his con acts. The film starts when Jess Barrett decides to go under internship and eventually the wing of Nicky to learn more about the tricks of the trade in con acts and many other criminal activities.They go together at first in New Orleans wherein they start to con many people during the Superbowl. As Jess becomes great as a con artist,she and Nicky develop a romantic relationship.But after the Superbowl,Nicky decides to leave Jess as romance cannot be a part of being a con man.After three years,they meet again at Buenos Aires. They renew their relationship and later found themselves involved in a con that includes billionaire motor sport team owner which could eventually endanger their lives. The first act at New Orleans was good enough.But the it fall somewhat flat in the second act in Buenos Aires.Too bad that the film basically had to mainly rely on the charms of Smith and Robbie to become bearable. Sad but true.Also,it had the twists and turns of the story especially when both Nicky and Jess were captured was far from intriguing as it basically consisted of clich√©s seen in many movies before.Surprisingly good Surprisingly good! Excellent profanity, and good supporting cast. Hot chick, too. Farhad does a good turn as best friend and partner. He is adept and highly watchable.  And where can I binge watch PanAm? I guess that is where they got their starlet. A good reader and very easy to look at. I am going to go back with a microscope for every frame with her in it. Central casting, fersher, but man, does she hit all the marks! She has the right mix of Audrey Hepburn, Melissa McCarthy, and Charlise Theron. Somebody is going to make a lot of money with her.Its alright but again, its not the best I loved Will Smith and Margot Robbie teaming up together for the first time and Im excited to see them again in the film "Suicide Squad". I thought the storyline with this was too fast and really not getting to the point of being a conman. Its like we see stealing first, then lying and then stealing again. What job were they actually doing? I found the characters really, I liked how they were sneaky and smart in stealing peoples stuff while talking to them. It was funny when the two characters kept betting on BD Wong's character with lots of money. I would be wondering if that really is real money? I say, the cast will be paid that much for taking part in the movie anyway so they can't complain!  Its an alright film, I would not consider this to be the best of their work.tgchan says YES~! / www.tgchan.pl 6.6 from 10125,922 users. I have no idea what to expect from this one. 7 minutes - slow and lame start  14 minutes - lame... it feels like some old-fashioned circus that nobody likes anymore  25 minutes - it is not bad... but it stinks with FAKE so much I can barely stand it... They even got some guy who looks and sounds almost exactly like Kevin Spacey. I had to check it, because I wasn't sure... 36 minutes - silly... yet entertaining  44 minutes - what a great moment~! They have tricked me as well  47 minutes - scratch that... now when they have explained it, it is just plain stupid... I am actually ashamed that I liked it in the first place... 49 minutes - f*ck me sideways... scratch that above once again, it was indeed amazing~! I guess I need to FOCUS more :)  56 minutes - the moment when you have no clue whatsoever what will happen next. I think I am starting to like it. I still have my bet, and I will be truly disappointed if I guess right  1h 6 minutes - ambitious, but a little over the top 1h 19 minutes - constant surprises  1h 32 minutes - UNPREDICTABLE~! unless you are really FOCUSed. I was able to foresee thing or two, but you are kept in the dark most of the time. Pleasantly surprised with this one. tgchan's rating: 6.5 /10You really need to...focus! :p This movie really messed my brain, in a good way. The whole twist plots got me thinking..."what is it all this, what on earth just happened" and the ironic part is that this kept me focused in the whole movie. The actors did great , all of them, especially will smith and margot robbie. The comical part of the movie was great too, it really got a smile on my face. Don't expect much drama because if there is it wont last too much. Also as many said it lacks a little bit of genre because there is not a clear shot by what they actually want to do. In my opinion it could have been better but I didn't really thought it would be that good by watching the trailer, so I really recommend to give it a watch, you wont regret it.Not just Jess...Am a blind mouse too :) :) :) :). Really funny to see negative reviews ,saying no plot , no story, no continuity , no grip blah blah. All those are pure crap. Ignore all negative reviews and see the movie . You will enjoy it thoroughly. Don't miss the football match scene. Oh man!!!! He really got me. The way WILL SMITH took the scene, his "Sad crying " look. I bet , when Margot Robbie does a sigh of relief in that scene, you will almost kill yourself.....Perfect Perfect and Perfect!! Good number of twists though out the movie. And don't expect this movie to be a documentary and expect a message to society . And no actor had to prove their acting skills. Every one just lived as themselves and I can see the entire crew's mood reflected. No blood, no violence, no gore. Clean and Jolly movie. This is perfect entertainment movie.  Overall.. I would love to see the Football match scene again and again and again and again . You man WiLLie. Where do you even get that face !!!!How can you even show desperation, disappointment, stress, anxiety , sadness without a single drop of tear... all together Extra ordinary....Don't miss it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Gratifying Conman/Heist Movie With Good Acting and A Quick Pace There were some interesting factors at play for the cast of this movie. Will needed to rebound after the debacle that was After Earth. Margot was looking to build off of her breakout performance in The Wolf of Wall Street. When I was looking at the trailers it definitely looked like the movie could be a lot of fun so I went into this with low expectations, due to the February release date but I was hopeful and I do enjoy a good heist/conman movie. *Minor Spoilers Ahead* Nicky (Will Smith) pulls some strings to get a table at a club and while he's at his table, an attractive woman named Jess (Margot Robbie) asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend to ward off some creepy guy at the bar. They get to talking and after a while, Nicky is invited up to her room. Just as things start to heat up, some man bursts in claiming to be her husband. Instead of panicking, Nicky cracks jokes, realizing almost immediately that they are setting him up. He leaves but follows Jess when she leaves the hotel. After telling her more about his family's past, he agrees to show her some moves and he begins to steal everything that she has on her. He lectures her on maintaining focus and to pay attention to detail and when there is nothing left to teach (or to steal) he leaves for New Orleans to set up a crime ring while the Super Bowl is going on. Jess tracks him down though and begs him to let her be part of his crew. He reluctantly agrees to and reveals he knew about her being there the whole time. The first thing that I want to say about this movie is that it feels slick and I mean that in a good way. The locations are stunning, the cinematography is beautiful and the movie takes full advantage of that. Focus radiates a sense of cool (helped along from the efforts of the cast)and you want to see what will happen next. Adding to the well-polished feeling is that the film moves at a pretty quick pace (especially in the first half). There are small flaws in the plot (more on that later) but the movie moves fast enough that you sense the creators were aware of this and knew that they needed to deliver a tight story to help it along. I got the feeling that there were some experienced people at the reigns and they knew what they needed to do to make this movie appealing which I would say they did in spades. I found the acting in this movie to be impressive. I would say this is the strongest Will has been in a while. I don't understand the hate around his acting but he did try something distinctive here, playing a more unlikable main character. He was funny and suave, he always is but he's occasionally given the chance to do something more and he performs well. It felt like he was giving it his all and I think that came through in his performance. I also walked away really impressed with Margot Robbie's performance. Her character of Jess isn't given much back story so it's up to her to carry her share without added depth and she really pulled it off. Getting past the fact that she's beautiful between this and The Wolf On Wall Street, she really comes across as a pro and someone who is talented beyond her years. I'm definitely looking forward to what she does next. I also want to credit Adrian Martinez and BD Wong for being very funny in their respective roles. Rodrigo Santoro gave a surprisingly subtle performance and Gerald McRaney is great but he's given probably the worst dialogue out of the group. He does his best to sell it but it doesn't always work. I see this movie split into two distinct halves. I thought the first half of this movie is really strong. There's two interesting characters you are introduced to that have excellent chemistry, the dialogue is funny and most importantly, it finds a way to subvert most of the heist/conman movie tropes. Nicky and Jess concentrate more on working on a small scale, poking fun that in every story it's always about "the big con." The low key action scenes find an ideal balance between fun and interesting and from scene to scene you have something different to have fun with(the Super Bowl con was my favourite). The second half is still good but it's decidedly weaker. It becomes more of a romantic comedy, targeting the relationships as opposed to the con. It works because of the strong acting but it moonwalks back into conventionality. It's not predictable but you know it's all going to have a happy ending. My other complaint is with the ending itself, it seems like they went with a couple of twists too many. It's disappointing because the scene previous has an interesting take on a familiar device where the heroes are picked up by the villain's head henchman. They even spit out what would have been the most logical conclusion on the way to the finale. To me it felt like when you're caught doing something wrong as a kid, you rattle off too many excuses until one sticks. They go through many possible endings until they find what they think is the best one. I didn't affect the grade too much but after a promising start, Focus didn't quite stick the landing. Critics weren't kind to this movie and while it is solid as a whole, there are missteps. What elevated this movie for me is the efforts of the cast and the excellent first half. I enjoyed the movie for what it is and I believe if you go into it with low expectations, you'll find it's a fun entry into the genre.Good con movie, Multi Racial upgrade of "The Sting" I saw "Focus" in the movie theater and later on cable. Will Smith did a good job and The Australian cutie, Margot Robbie work really well together. They should do a sequel to this movie. It is a modern day "Sting" that starred Robert Redford, Paul Newman, Robert Shaw and co-starred Harold Gould. However the only non white actor in that movie was actor, James Earl Jones' real life dad, Robert Earl Jones in a small supporting role. This version "Focus", I liked for several reasons. 1 The multiracial cast with Asians and Hispanics in supporting roles.  2. I especially love that art imitates real life with the interracial love between Will Smith and really cute, Margot Robbie. They have really good chemistry together. All the scenes in the football stadium was right on the money. I too thought he was going to lose it all at the game. The only part that I did Not get was Gerald McRaney playing his dad until it was announced in the end and even then I was not sure, if Will's character was his adopted son, real son or just some young man, he was to look after and he loved like a son. I give this movie two thumbs up and a 9 on the scale of 1-10.lame There is a reason why "caper" thriller are so universally popular among the audience. They are like sweets - they must be seriously bad to be perceived as bad. While the swindle in real life often viewed as a crime (fully justified), the gentleman crooks and bandits brave adrenaline in fiction and sometimes the news harbor respect. The reason is clear: we are usually not the victims, we are too smart and / or poor for that. Their victims are rich or at least well-off people with character flaws: unfaithful husbands, compulsive gamblers, greedy or simply inattentive types. Focus is one such, average to solid "caper", which evokes memories of some of the older movies that is perceived as better, you might then time for their innovation, perhaps because of nostalgic patina.Good For Will Smith Fans If you like Will Smith playing a cool high class con Will Smith, you will enjoy this film.If you like looking at some hot looking women you will like this film. If you like a film with a big con plot, sorry it does not come off that well. If you like reality, nope. If you like action, nope. Still the film has some good points. There is a solid music sound track with a lot of good music. There are flavors of New Orleans. The cast around Smith does a very good job with their script. The acting tries to bring this movie into a top shelf effort. The script lets them down. The script tries to glorify con men by making them into a elite class. Trouble is it moves beyond reality and into the Twilight Zone some place or other. The focus is on Con but people carrying around millions of dollars in cash is just not realistic unless they are in the drug trade. There are several chances to complicate the plot over looked because Smith is hampered by being smitten. There are more than 1 con, and some of the cons are pretty complex, but when you sum it all out the ending with Gerald McRaney is a bit of a disappointment and the reality involving Smith being shot is just not practical. If you like seeing big bags of cash, and good acting it is a great film. But it does have some major draw backs beyond that.Blurred vision There is nothing new about con-men and grifters in film, but the casting of Will Smith and Margot Robbie, certainly creates enough interest. The premise of Smith's character, creating outcomes in his favor "by design" becomes completely implausible. Whilst the first act in New Orleans has some good moments, the final act runs out of steam and becomes a little too far fetched. At no stage do you really buy in to the chemistry between Smith and Robbie, which in the 2nd half of the film, is pretty much the only thing the film is asking you to care about. If you want to see a good film about pickpockets, let me recommend Oliver!Focus (2015) -Focus is a 2015 American romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, starring Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Rodrigo Santoro. --Filming: -Principal photography began on September 14, 2013 in New Orleans, and moved over to Buenos Aires on November 19, 2013 for three weeks. The last day of shooting in Argentina was on December 10. Filming wrapped in New York City on December 17, 2013. --Critical response: -Focus received mixed reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 56%, based on 181 reviews, with a rating average of 5.8/10. The site's consensus reads, "Focus may have a few too many twists and turns, but it nearly skates by on its glamorous setting and the charm of its stars." On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 56 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". According to CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale. -Film review blog Movie Metropolis praised Smith and Robbie's performances but criticised the lack of depth given to the rest of the story, which the reviewer felt was struggling with what genre it was trying to be. On a similar note, critic David Palmer of The Reel Deal gave the film 5/10, saying, that "two likable leads and some colorful locations do not make a great movie, but they certainly help to elevate an otherwise average one." -The Free Press Journal called the film "smart, slick, but shallow".Interesting take on heists Focus (2015)then begins to jump ahead three years to Buenos Aires, where Nicky(Will Smith) has been hired to pull off the con of his career by a rich Grand Prix race car owner (Rodrigo Santoro) and his gruff but thorough hired security. And who should show up to disrupt his plans but Jess, causing Nicky to drop his guard and lose focus, as he finds himself in a position of having to choose between the big payoff and the woman he can't let go of again. Films about the big con and the people who pull them off are seductive and irresistibly appealing. Many plot twists which make Focus a great and entertaining recommended watch.Unconvincing story lets down decent actors Standard Hollywood fodder - roguish hero gets girl; loses girl; realises that she is more important than 'other thing' in his life; chases to get girl back, aided by the rest of the world. From the start, this film is a bit stinky. Smith plays 'Mellow' - short for Marshmellow (which isn't even a thing - they are marshmAllows) - a petty thief/big-ticket con artist. Therein lies the first problem - why someone with the skills and connections required to make multi-million dollar heists, would risk getting pinched for stealing wallets, is beyond me. The New Orleans operation is massive - too big to avoid: a) members keeping their horde, rather than handing it to a fellow criminal; b) someone getting caught and arrested. These criminals all just trust Nicky to fence their gear and give them a fair cut? Riiiight. Margot Robbie is good in the film, but her acceptance into the crew seems a little light - she could be anyone infiltrating their gang. No references - nothing. Just pretty. And good at small jobs. I could go on, but you get the idea. It's a light-hearted romp, with some good actors not getting to show their talents properly, due to to a spotty plot. If you just want something to 'happen' in front of you, for 2 hours of your life, and you aren't ashamed to be dumbed-down, then this isn't that bad. 4/10.Unfocused I have not been a fan of most of Will Smith's more recent movies (After Earth anyone?), so I thought about skipping this movie all together. But the thought of seeing the future pairing of Deadshot and Harley Quinn on screen before the 2016 Suicide Squad movie was too tempting to pass up. Sprinkle in that I'm a sucker for heist/con movies, and off to the movies I went. Focus stars Will Smith as con man Nicky who happens upon Jess (Margot Robbie) and teaches her some of what he knows about running a con. In the process, romantic feelings surface between the two of them. Later, while running another con, Nicky runs into a now more experienced Jess and it creates problems both with the con and with his life. I didn't buy into the romantic angle between Nicky and Jess in the movie. The two just didn't seem to really be in to each other and it showed in the film. However, they chemistry between the characters when they would just talk to each other about the con was fantastic. This chemistry is what I'm hoping to see in the Suicide Squad movie. Also, Adrian Martinez was fantastic in the role of Farhad and was by far my favorite character in the film. I could see myself actually hanging out with a person like this, and I actually have as he reminded me of many of my Marine friends with his off-color sense of humor. The addition of Gerald McRaney as Owen was also very well done and he completely sold me on his character. Major Dad is always a win in my books. Major Dad Major F'n Dad! Overall, if you like a good heist movie or if you just want to get a good look at Deadshot and Harley together on screen, then go see this movie. It is a good popcorn flick where you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the flick. This isn't a great movie, but a good movie that is worth your money.Kicked off well, kept the momentum, but the end was... It's a Will Smith's movie, anyway, I was going to watch it, but when the initial cast dropped out, followed by a couple more, simply intrigued me. Actually, I enjoyed the film, but did not like it because of the bad ending. It was a good twist, except the shooting thing. An example how a tiny part can decide the entire movie's fate. Well written crime-drama, with a touch of romance. After all the obstacles, the final cast were at their best. Heist movies always excite me because of the involvement of the tricks and thrills. Nicky, a con artist who recruits a small time thief, Jess to work with his gang. When the job and the romance advancing smoothly, an unexpected split happens. So the years passed, when they meet again, what comes is the crux of the remaining story. The first half let us know what kind of character the Nicky is. His overwhelmed dedication for his undertaking and his reliable team's the focus. Overall, it was the best portion of the movie, and the next half goes for the giant kill, but lacks enthusiasm. More like a revenge or jealousy type narration, but only until reaching the climax where it tries being a very clever and happen all the things at a brisk pace. The film was better than I thought, after learning it was criticised, mostly very badly. Would have been a bit better if the writing was cautious for the crucial parts. Importantly, like I said the end part. 'Yes' for the entertainment it provided and 'no' for one of the best products of the year, 6¬Ω/10A decent but lacking con movie. Will Smith's latest film is clever, yet leaving you with the feeling of wanting more from it. Parts are definitely well told and the actual 'conning' certainly brought a smile to my face. However, the problem is that at times it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Is it a con film or a love story with stolen watches thrown in? This is where it gets bogged down. On the plus side, as mentioned before, the scamming is definitely the high point of the film with a couple of twists and turns that will either leave you in shock or leave you sat there laughing. The film peaks too early for my liking before finally being dragged to a decent ending. Not the best film you'll see this year but certainly not the worst. A good concept that should have been told better.Focus, from Good to Lame I saw Focus a few days ago, after a friend recommended it to me. I thought, Will Smith, Margo Robbie, awesome thieves, speed and thrill.. Just my type of film. And at first i was amazed. The plot is great, Smith has a talent of playing a d"#khead/Mr.Cool. But further into the film, deeper into the plot i felt that the film started to get a bit over dramatic and lost much of the speed and thrill i found in the beginning.  I give "Focus" 5/10, because of the loss of suspense and to much direction change for me. Lastly i apologize for my English, grammar and stuff like that.  Peace!Will Smith is back and in Great Form, Focus is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's a very enjoyable movie that takes you in straight away, it dosen't waste any time, and I liked that it took this approach, it brought the characters on their journey immediately and developed them throughout instead of providing most of the character development before they head off, it's quite unusual for a movie but I thought they succeeded with it and didn't leave me feeling like either of the two lead characters are underdeveloped, I also thought the ending was a very well written final act, and the twists just kept on coming. The film seemed to have a hard time balancing out between being a crime caper and a romance, I felt like it should have focused on crime much more, it was an interesting story that kept me intrigued, and though I did like the love story, I felt lit didn't necessarily have to be as vital as it was and stall the story as much as it did. Will Smith is back in action here in his first lead role since Men in Black 3 way back in 2012, he is still the charismatic and likable actor that everyone knows and loves him for, and this also goes for Margot Robbie, who stole several scenes and gets to shine as an actress here even more than she did in Wolf of Wall Street, the two made a great pair and were able to make these characters likable, which didn't seem easy as they were very flawed. A slick and well acted crime film, Focus may be forgetful, but it's while it lasts, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or romance.  A professional con man takes an amateur under his wing, but a complicated relationship soon blossoms between them.  Best Performance: Will Smith Worst Performance: Adrian MartinezFrequently rewarding, if mostly disappointing caper flic. For the first roughly 40 minutes of "Focus," I had high hopes of a con film on par with "The Sting" and "The Film-Flam Man," a largely-forgotten, minor masterpiece with George C. Scott. Then, "Focus" became as soft and predictable as the "mallow," that is the nickname of one of the characters. What really redeems "Focus" is the chemistry between Will Smith and Margo Robbie. Robbie is a real find; and her chemistry with Smith is most convincingly romantic I have seen in this century. Unfortunately, the sting (pardon the pun) that takes up roughly two-thirds of the movie is utterly predictable and unconvincing. Great production values, fun cast, that wonderful chemistry, clever opening and little else. I give "Focus" a soft "6".Great actors, terrible movie Will Smith and Margot Robbie (and all the supporting actors) do a great job with what they are given. These are talented actors for sure, as they managed to keep me watching all the way to the end of this awful movie. The problems:  Main characters are fairly one-dimensional and unbelievable The first half of the movie has nothing to do with the second half other than a couple minor references. There is no coherent story arc, just the flat, under-developed love interest.  I suggest watching 'The Score' instead.Almost hits the bulls! The idea of the movie is good enough. It is unique and fresh from the oven. How they implemented the theory of sociology and psychology and such things, it is awesome. But, my concern is, if this movie wants to tell people that there are really theories of human behaviour about all of it, why don't expose them much more? At the beginning until middle of the movies, it is very interesting. But, nearly end of the story, it becomes anti-climax. I'm dissapointed with the presentation of the ''final mission'' which i think done really mediocrity. The only thing helps this film up at the end is the third party which almost unpredictable. It was going to be a very good movie, but the ending is not good enough. Almost hits the bulls!Un-Focus This movie will totally make you... unfocused! You might watch the trailer and think: it doesn't look bad, I will give it a try! This is a perfect example of deception. You expect one thing, and you get another, specially if you read the plot summary!! Don't do that, because you will already know half of the movie!! That is what happened to me, I watched the trailer and then read the summary, boy was it a big mistake! While I was watching the movie I was like, when is the thing of the summary happening? Hello! Way half the movie! So if you read it you can skip the first half of the film!! Or you can read mine, which is minute 1 in the movie and find the rest for yourself! Ah! Either way, you will feel like, uh? Where is the plot!!??? Yes, fresh Prince of Bel-Air is in there, but sorry, Mr Smith has been going down since After Earth, really a pity, but he is still a box office caller... So the film might earn some money, specially as the first viewers go to watch it, but then, it will go downwards faster than you can say Grey!! In the film there is al Margot big bad Wolf Street Wolf Robbie, not a bad actress, but she will need something better to show how well an actress she is. Save yourself some money and go to the zoo! Watching the monkeys sleep will be a better entertainment than watching this movie. BANANA!Focus As good as 7 pounds was , this was that bad absolute rubbish .Will Smith being Will Smith again There are no truly original heist/con movies left. Not any more, not ever again. But seeing Will Smith be Will Smith again (finally)? That was fun. Here's to fewer alien fighters and more real characters moving forward, Will. That's what movie stardom should look like. Hopefully next time you have a more original story to go with it.Margot Robbie Is The Best Thing In It Continuing my plan to watch every Will Smith movie in order I come to Focus (2015) Plot In A Paragraph: Nicky (Smith) is a con artist whose role is decieving people for a living but when he meets a young aspiring con artist named Jesse (Margot Robbie) and takes her under his wing.  This movie is dull, flat and uninspired and for someone so charismatic, Will Smith is surprisingly subdued!! Margot Robbie is very attractive and can act whilst Gerald McRaney is suitably intimidating.  Focus grossed $53 million at the domestic box office, to end 2015 as the 55th highest grossing movie of the year.Pairing has potential Master con-man Nicky 'Mellow' Spurgeon (Will Smith) is intrigued by amateur thief Jess Barrett (Margot Robbie). He shows her a few moves. She tracks him down later which he expected. She begs him to be her mentor and he lets her into his crew running cons in New Orleans. However at the end, he leaves her behind. Three years later, he's running a con and is surprised to see Jess again in Buenos Aires. This is meant to be a fun caper movie and it is just that at times. I really like Margot Robbie whenever she plays up her fun side. Will Smith could smile a little more and have a bit more fun. They seem to have fun flirting but the movie needs more moments of fun. This pairing has potential which is not fully realized.Not bad, but just tries too be too much, too important for its own good "Focus" is an American 100-minute movie from 2015, so by now it is two years old. It was written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, a duo of filmmakers that has collaborated for a really long time and this resulted in some good and some not so good works apparently. I guess this one here is somewhere in-between, maybe closer to the not so good. It features Will Smith and Margot Robbie as the lead actors and while both are really big names, I still don't see that great talent in both of them, especially Robbie. They aren't bad actors, but they are also far from convincing unfortunately when their characters require true range and depth and they can only partially may make up for these shortcoming with their great deal of charisma. Then again, they fit nicely in here because this movie (and the script in particular) are also about make-believe. The two filmmakers I mentioned earlier definitely need a lesson in subtlety. There are many many scenes and moments, and eventually the entire film, where they go way over the top and not in a good way at all. The first meeting between the two protagonists is a good example. Yes they want to depict that teacher-student relationship and show us how skilled Smith is, but all those tricks, all that he steals from her is just too much. Half of the items would really have been enough. This is a bit of shame as the "angry boyfriend" scene before that was actually not too bad. And there are more food scenes like the one with BD Wong (he gave a nice supporting performance and is probably among Asia's best in Hollywood right now), which was somewhat fun to see and the best thing is you don't even have to care about American Football to appreciate it because I sure don't. But these bright moments are quickly made up for and the negative element wins eventually. It's all so pompous, pseudo-intelligent and exaggerated that it's almost impossible to appreciate the film as a whole. Robbie and Smith are just means for the story and they also do not manage to elevate the script. The weakest moment of the film is probably the ending. I was tempted to give it a better rating before that final scene with Smith's character's father, but lets be honest here. A dad who shoots his brother in the chest (even with the medical justification) is just too much and this is where the film really loses it all and hits rock-bottom. I guess you can check this one out if you really care a lot about the world of con men, but it is still not a satisfying take and elaboration on the subject either. So maybe only check it out if you are a huge Smith and/or Robbie fan. Otherwise skip it and you are not missing much, especially not in terms of realism and fraud as the biggest trick pulled off in here was to make audiences believe this is actually a convincing work. Thumbs down.The Robbing Game Focus is not a really good movie. It's not a really bad movie either though. If you don't have a problem with Will Smith (and his relationship in this movie), you might be able to enjoy this. There are a couple of things in here, that are nicely told and shot (like the explanation or "how-to" guide). We concentrate on Will Smith and the movie tries to keep things mysterious which works at times, though the resolution of most of those mysteries are mostly disappointing. If you don't care for that, there is light fun to be had here. The chemistry sometimes is not what the movie will or would want you it to be, but overall it's a decent con movieDark comedy glamorizing the grifting game. Watched this on DVD from my public library.  Will Smith is Nicky, and expert thief and grifter. The early part of the movie takes place in New Orleans at Superbowl time. Those sorts of crowds attract many of the criminal persuasion. Here Nicky is working with a team he assembled, it is an art form, distracting targets to steal anything valuable, then sell it for the cash. One of the new people he meets is Margot Robbie as Jess, wanting to get accepted in the business. She is quite lovely to look at and is fine in her role. A second large part of the movie is in South America, Adrian Martinez plays racing mogul Farhad who hires Nicky to misrepresent himself as a disgruntled engineer who is willing to sell a proprietary set of racing software that would make them competitive. But Nicky would sell them the fake software, insuring an easier victory for Farhad and his cars, but of course Nicky has his own plans in mind to get the best of all of them. So what we have is a rather complex story that whenever you think you've figured out what is going on you get surprised again. In a sense it glamorizes the grifting game, and all the activities we see are probably not plausible at all, but what honest person really knows.  We were entertained, nothing else.best movie of the year so far! This was an awesome movie; the chemistry between the actors was inevitable! Honestly after watching fifty shades of gray, this movie was a breath of fresh air! It was sexy and the storyline had flow! I think this will be my number one movie this year! The characters had a lot of chemistry it was HOT! The storyline was very interesting and the whole movie had a message at the end! I would definitely watch it again in the cinema that is for sure. It did remain me of the movie HITCH, but with a much better storyline and much more action! I absolutely love how Will Smith just looks better with age and be still got it! Worth every penny.Good Movie To Talk about all day long I'm thrilled to see its success and there's good credit about the main two actors on the film.Will Smith is a guy who will bring much attention in terms of appearing funny and charming to the most audience so rather enjoy the movie by focusing on how it starts right up to the end.Margot Robbie on the other side is a new chick in the flick but has attractive talent and I wish I had a girl like her but not all that brings attention it's all about how she puts out the female superiority amongst lustful men who can't seem to find what she's all about although Will on the other hand is the one getting caught to be beaten up on his master-plans.Good movies like these don't wear-off like blue jeans in a bucket full of washing powder and water.Will Smith is amazing in this movie!! Watching this movie had me on the edge of my seat threw out the whole film. The way Will Smith executed the role of Nicky had me scratching my head thinking "Why wasn't he in the oceans eleven movies." He did a great job and don't let me discredit the supporting roles. All around a great movie from beginning to end. Definitely one of my favorite films from will Smith. It's also great to see Margot Robbie in a lead role, not only is she drop dead gorgeous but she can hold her own in a movie like this. Really didn't know what to expect walking into the theater to see it. But I definitely don't regret spending the money. I really look forward to see what Will Smith's next movie is going to be like. It's a Must watch film, and perfect for a date night. Two thumbs way up!!Leave it in his Will Smith is DOA and the writers don't even know Flip in this under-cooked caper that belongs in a jar with other seldom seen condiments. Every attempt to extract any chemistry from the leads (Smith and Robbie) puts out all the heat you might expect from a post grad party at a rural casino. She may yet eek out a career, but his is shot. The mixture is just foolish. Reviews require ten lines of text. Here come four more:....... ....... ...... ...... ....... ......... ........ ........ .... ...... ......... .......... ............ ............... .......... ....... .......... ......... ........ .......... ......... .......etc.
Big Dumb America Hilariously dumb and manipulative, it's entertaining on that level alone, although scary in that it's so boarder line that you can't be sure the movie was made with tongue anywhere near cheek, I'm inclined to think not. That this movie is serious, that America needs to feel like a scared kitten rescued by a big stack of muscles. That stack of muscles is Dwayne Johnson and it's hard not to love him. He's kinda good in this, I like him, even when he's part of this manipulative propaganda. The special effects were nice. it kinda flowed, sort of, I guess, lots of plot holes but why bother looking for them when the iq level they're aiming this at is so low you're not supposed to notice. The cheesy flag at the end gives you another good piece of cheese to choke on. If we're going to go down we might as well go down stupid.What did everyone expect? It's a disaster movie! I read some of the reviews here and am wondering what all the negative reviewers expected. Who didn't know this was a huge, costly disaster movie? Who didn't know there were going to be many unbelievable scenes? Who didn't know there would be some cheesy dialogue?  Well, I, for one, enjoyed it. The last good disaster movie I saw was The Towering Inferno, and you know that was a long, long time ago. It's still my favorite disaster flick. San Andreas, of course, had much better special effects. (several decades later, better effects, right?) I thought the scenes of the destruction were amazing.  We all know disaster movies usually focus on a handful of people in it and this one was no different. The movie was entertaining for me. I hope it is for you, too. :)Disastrous My first experience in the UltraScreen¬ÆDLX with massive screen, Dreamlounger¬ô leather reserved recliners, and Dolby Atmos immersive sound with bass you can feel (it's true), was none other than to see San Andreas. If you haven't been following my reviews this summer, my goal is to review all of the summer blockbusters on cheap movie days for $5. My first surprise was that the seats are reserved. You get to pick your seat, although there were few left to choose from when I arrived. The second surprise was that the chairs are power recliners, so you just push a button and wham you go back and your legs go up. The third surprise was a smell I hadn't smelled in years, not since junior high locker room. It was a mix of people who don't like to shower, don't like to wash their gym clothes, and wet tile. Then a nice young couple who dry humped the whole movie sat next to me and at least she was wearing a strong perfume that mostly covered up the smell. But I digress. What about this disaster movie? It features a family (that apparently has no last name, at least not that I ever learned, nor is there any last name listed for them in the credits, so I will call them Family #1), a pretty family, an upper-middle-class family that is going through a rather benign divorce and Emma causes trouble immediately because she is moving in with a richy rich dude (who has a last name, because he's Daniel Riddick), a thoroughly loathsome man incapable of love except for buildings. Ray is solid as a rock, he's something sturdy, like a real man, someone you can cling to or hold on to no matter what. He loves his daughter, Blake, very much, because he blames himself for the death of his other daughter, whom we eventually learn died while rafting. You see, Ray is a professional rescue-chopper pilot, so the death of his daughter is as much personal as it was a professional blunder. The main problem with this disaster movie is that Family #1 is split in two groups, and there is no real belief that any of them will ever actually die, although San Andreas does feature Blake enduring the longest non-death sequence I've ever seen. In better disaster movies, like the original Poseidon Adventure (it's unfortunate that I have to clarify the "original" Poseidon Adventure) the protagonists are traipsing and shambling through the disaster together, and they drop like flies until the very end, when only a handful of the worthy and fortunate survive. The acting in San Andreas isn't bad, and it's not good. It's extremely okay. Poor Paul Giamatti, who seems typecast as himself these days. Things blow up, collapse, and fall apart real good. The special effects are pretty amazing and realistic. It's nice to see so many Californians perish as a precursor to the Great Water Wars of 2016. In fact, even though Ray is a civil servant responsible for saving lives, he tries to fly the chopper from L.A. to San Francisco to save his daughter instead of trying to save anyone in Los Angeles or elsewhere along the way. He _does_, however, trade a stolen pickup for directions to an airfield, which I suppose is a fair trade and shows he's a Really Good Guy. There is a bit of adventure. Ray commandeers trains and boats and planes. Well, no trains. That would've been pretty cool to drive a train through an earthquake. A simple oversight, I suppose. Nevertheless, I sensed the feeling of excitement at the thought of being in a real disaster, stealing whatever vehicles were around to go wherever I wanted. And it's nice to see a lot of chopper scenes in a movie. There should be more chopper scenes in every movie. Forget the millions of Californians who died or were dying along the way. All we care about are a handful of pretty, well-off people trying to survive the worst earthquake in human history. We rarely see anyone die, because they get swooped up or down or crushed. No bones, no blood, no limbs flying everywhere. It's pretty WASPish death, as people disappear in clouds of dust, never to be seen or heard from again. Despite all the Californian death and destruction, Americans can be jingoistically proud to see a final flowing flag confirming we are the best nation-state on Earth, and we will rebuild it all for the next disaster.Wow. This movie is absolutely terrible. Imagine melting a 4kg ball of Edam, a 12kg slab of cheddar and 47 cases of mozzarella, it still wouldn't be anywhere near as cheesy as this piece of drivel. I was dragged along to see it and for the entire time I sat there wondering if this was some kind of sick joke I wasn't in on. The effects were decent but lets be honest, which movie doesn't have decent effects nowadays? The acting is absolutely horrific, the rock has the acting ability of a disabled fox and I wanted the two English toff kids to die every time they appeared on the screen. The girl in it, although very attractive, has the personality of a sprout. Bah! if anyone offers to watch this movie in your presence please punch them in the face. The ending where the rock says something like "now we rebuild" and the American flag unfurls in the wind made me want to spew my popcorn all over the cinema floor. Avoid at all costs.Rehashed crap. This was one of the worst examples of Hollywood smearing money on something until a room full of idiots gives texted approvals. A brave, muscle bound man rescues his soon to be ex-wife, who just happens to be marrying a real Snidley McWhiplash billionaire played by one of the dingus's from fantastic 4... by commandeering a coastguard helicopter and basically doing whatever the hell he wants with it which apparently is to fly over literally millions and millions of people in immediate need of rescue to save his wife and daughter. Both of which are horribly cast, plastic coated Californians lounging poolside and enjoying the finer things in life and then... Disaster strikes! There is no connection with these characters and you just don't care if they live or die, I was hoping for the latter in every case. Oh, and there's the "expert" quoting countless geologists from the discovery channel who conveniently and of course, narrowly escapes death dozens of times only to unfailingly "know" what's about to happen, sadly, just after it happens.  This is a perfect example of Hollywood, being Hollywood and should be avoided by anyone who's been hollywooded before, which is anyone watching this kind of crap over the last several decades. I would have given it a 0 but IMDb, sadly doesn't give that option.San Andreas. Going into this film I knew it wasn't going to be one of the best films I've ever seen I just knew I would like the visual effects and the action, although there were some parts that wouldn't have happened in real life but that's standard Hollywood, it's expected. The story line and plot wasn't anything spectacular. It wasn't anything you haven't seen before, very clich√©d and predictable. The Rock's performance in this film did give it that extra kick that was needed to make this film a bit more tolerable. If you're planning on seeing this film enjoy the ride for the visual effects and the action, don't expect very much more. I'm not going to say it's bad and I'm not going to say it's good. It's just a clich√©d Hollywood work of art. You be the judge.Lame Story, Great Special Effects In Los Angeles, the Fire Department Air Rescue pilot Raymond "Ray" Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) will drive his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) to San Francisco since she has joined the university. He is divorcing from his wife Emma (Carla Gugino) that intends to move in together with her wealthy boyfriend Daniel Riddick (Ioan Gruffudd). Meanwhile the researchers Dr. Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) and Dr. Kim Park (Will Yun Lee) from the Caltech travel to a dam to check their seismic studies and there is a strong earthquake collapsing the dam that kills Kim. Lawrence discovers that the San Andreas Fault is moving and will cause a huge earthquake in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Ray needs to travel to help the victims from the dam and Daniel offers to take Blake to San Francisco since he has a meeting in the city. Daniel brings Blake to his office and while waiting for him, she befriends the British architect Ben Taylor (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his younger brother Ollie Taylor (Art Parkinson). When Ray is flying to the dam, there is an earthquake in Los Angeles and he rescues Emma. When the earthquake reaches San Francisco, Daniel escapes with Blake to his limousine but the building collapses and she is trapped inside the car. Daniel flees from the building and leaves Blake behind. Blake succeeds in contacting her father but the cell phone dies. What will happen to her? "San Andreas" is a popcorn disaster movie, a genre that was usual in the 70's, but with state-of-art special effects. Unfortunately, the lame and corny story is ridiculous. Ray uses the helicopter to rescue his wife and daughter and destroy it. He steals a pickup truck; an airplane from the hangar; and a boat to save his daughter apparently with no consequences. His ex-wife Emma resolves all her issues with Ray in the middle of the chaos. There is no cell phone, but the fixed-line telephone works perfectly despite the destruction and havoc. Blake, Ben and Ollie save the film. There is a tsunami and Ray drives the motor boat in the middle of the debris and possible survivors as if he were in a race. In the end, love is beautiful! My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Terremoto: A Falha de San Andreas"("Earthquake: The San Andreas Fault")"Well that escalated quickly" Opening scene - girl driving - 30 seconds later she's hanging off a revine, her car ready to plunge into the abyss. This movie is relentless - it is a hard-core disaster movie with almost zero characterisation and 100% action-driven chaos with Hollywood's CGI department on overdrive. And it makes absolutely no apology for this - nor should it. The fireworks kick in from the start and never let up - buildings tumble, tsunamis flood, and heroic Dwayne Johnson, amusingly invulnerable to any form of damage (the man doesn't suffer a scratch), does his level best to save the day as a well-placed search and rescue veteran. Sure the water effects are a bit unconvincing (Hollywood still doesn't seem to know how to create convincing white froth - it always looks like what it often actually is; smoke) and there's no real need for a 'villain' in the story, but who cares. This is Hollywood at its blockbuster best. A brainless loud thrillfest which engages the senses (if not the mind) throughout. Enjoy it for what it is. If you're watching it, you know what to expect.Great disaster movie This movie is first for Californians then for blinder than bat people. The first scene with the subaru and the blonde thats Topanga and Auzsa canyon, yes they do crumble and they do eff people up, thats just "normal" San Andreas fault and Hayward Fault are about to go off any day now..itll be 9.0+ so more or less what you see in the movie can turn into reality, not as bad but bad enough... so for us CALIFORNIANS that live in SF bay area we feel and understand this movie, basically an EXAGGERATED example to wake people up and give them an idea of how bad could it get, so we kinda know what will happen and if you lucky to stay alive what should we do, i cant believe how much production and work went into bringing idea as such on screen and gotta say they did a good job, because if you use your brain its too much details to capture and bring together, most people who rate this bad are just ungrateful clowns...this movie is not easy to make unless you are delusional from your couch as many people are. I LOVED it on the screen in reality i hope it never happens here but we all know its just matter of time.Special Effects Are Spectacular-But Dialogue &amp; Storyline Hokey As Heck I'm usually all in for disaster flicks, and the special effects in this one are spectacular (Colin Strause). There's an excellent cast as well, led by Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino with good support form Alexandra Daddario, Paul Giamatti, and Hugo Johnstone-Burt. However, I hope you're not expecting any earth shattering (no pun intended) dialogue or storyline, because the filmmakers here have taken every plot clich√© and hokey line of dialogue and thrown it into this movie. All in all, this film, directed by Brad Peyton, with a screenplay from Carlton Cuse, is just an escape filled with one tension packed scene after another, but don't be surprised if you find yourself unintentionally laughing out loud with some of the cheesy dialogue and plot elements.Could this be the worst film of the year so far? Without question it is. San Andreas is truly a disaster of monumental proportions. The main character, Ray (Dwayne Johnson), is a divorced Search and Rescue helicopter pilot who is still in love with his estranged wife. Not only can he fly helicopters, he can also fly light aircraft and drive speedboats at the drop of a hat. In fact, he can do anything and if the scriptwriters (and I use that term loosely) hadn't been able to provide a vehicle for him they would probably have given him the power of unaided flight.  His estranged wife is about to move in with a mega-rich architect, who you are pretty sure will turn into a cowardly arsehole and meet a predictably sticky end.  His daughter has no personality knows everything about survival, something which, I assume, she has gained from her father by means of osmosis.  His daughter's love interest (Hugo Johnstone-Burt), a young British man (and by British I mean someone who is not British but is putting on an obviously fake British accent) who, despite being an engineer, is fairly stupid and follows her like a homeless dog would follow a tramp with bacon in his pocket. He also has an annoying kid brother.  The love interest's kid brother (Art Parkinson), is so annoying that you desperately want to see him die in horrific and (preferably) painful circumstances at the earliest opportunity, but unfortunately he doesn't. The main characters are all rich, WASPish and thoroughly dislikeable, and bear no resemblance to anyone you would want to care about. Or meet. Ever. There is no plot to speak of, just a series of unbelievable escapes that takes suspension of disbelief to a whole new level.  In one scene Ray's estranged wife is having lunch in a restaurant on the top floor of a skyscraper (where else?)when an earthquake hits. She phones Ray, who is about a hundred miles away and who tells her to head to the roof and wait for him.Ray flies to her rescue, ignoring all the other people requiring his assistance and when he gets there the building is starting to collapse. As she runs toward the helicopter the roof caves in and she falls about six storeys down, but amazingly she survives enough to run up the rubble and jump on to the helicopter.  Now, all this would have been fine if her character had for years been hiding her secret identity of Supergirl from her husband, but unfortunately she isn't the Man of Steel's unnecessary cousin. This is a woman who has just come from living the high life of the idle rich, and let's be honest here, if you were a Search and Rescue pilot whose wife had (presumably) been shagging this mega-rich arsehole for months and was about to move into his grand house with him, a house, by the way, that you could never afford in a million years on your measly Search and Rescue pilot salary, would you go out of your way to rescue her? I know I wouldn't. I'd be hovering over her rooftop rescue point in my helicopter shouting, "Burn bitch! You had it coming!" The scene on the rooftop with Ray and his estranged wife takes place within the first thirty minutes of this CGI-heavy film, and as it plods inexorably and excruciatingly on the situations get progressively ridiculous and unbelievable. It's all spectacle and no substance, and the spectacle's nothing to write home about because the special effects are nothing you haven't seen before in other superior disaster movies. When are the people who produce these insults to intelligence going to realise that CGI effects are not a replacement for a solid screenplay and good acting. But what about the dialogue? Well, I know this is difficult to believe, but it's even worse. When Ray is whinging on about how he couldn't save his daughter from drowning (that's the first one than drowned), his wife says to him, "If you couldn't save her, Ray, no-one could." Really? I bet they could have. An Olympic swimmer probably could have. Or a dolphin. Besides, throughout the film Ray proves that he's a pretty useless Search and Rescue pilot, choosing only to save members of his immediate family and annoying numpties with fake British accents. I wanted to include all the bad dialogue in the film in this review, but that would have meant printing out the entire screenplay, and I didn't have time for that. The worst chunk of dialogue comes right at the end of the film. Ray's estranged wife looks at him with dreamy eyes (that's right, she's fallen in love with him again because he's so MANLY) and asks, "What now?" And, as the Stars and Stripes unfurls before him, he replies, "Now we rebuild."  Yeah, woo-hoo! Let's take the dumbest film of the year and add a bit of patriotism into the mix to make it doubly dumb. I wish the San Andreas Fault had split open and swallowed up every extant copy of San Andreas. Preferably about a week ago, so I wouldn't have had the misfortune of watching it.Total waste of time I had been waiting to see this with much anticipation and what a complete let down. I can honestly say I have not seen such an awful film for a long time. After watching San Andres Fault by mistake I was so hopeful that nothing could be quite as bad as that. I was wrong. I know it's a big blockbuster and made to leave the viewer in awe, but I just laughed at it. My partner and I sat and said what was going to happen next and it did. The plot was dire from the start and I was kind of hoping the film would end before it had even got half way through it. Why do they always have Brits in American films who sound like they are so posh? Totally not called for. The acting was OK and I like Dwayne Johnson, but this was beneath him. The most ridiculous film in years.A lot of useless story lines I'm all for stupid/cheesy/lame action movies, but this one seems to have intentionally not put any effort into this at all. The whole story of the dead daughter is just annoying and doesn't add to the action. I find it actually takes away as it's useless. Also, the whole divorce between the 2 parents. Again, it doesn't add to the story simply distracts from the action. As does the moms boyfriend. We could have done without him. I mean honestly, if he hadn't been in the movie, if the dead daughter storyline was left out, there'd be no difference. The characters would still be the same as would the events.  All these "distractions" I found to be annoying to the point where I couldn't enjoy the movie. Also, a lot of eye rolling dialogue. For example, after Blake is rescued from the car at the beginning, she and the 2 brothers are running in the streets, buildings falling apart all around them, they've seen people get crushed by debris... Ben (the older brother) asks Blake "why do you wear 2 of the same necklaces?" really? I mean, really? groan. If you don't mind something incredibly predictable with no surprises at all (I'm just an hour into the movie so maybe they'll end up all dying!)then go ahead. I mean, it's still Dwayne Johnson! However, there are better "end of the world" type of movies out there such as The Day After Tomorrow.Money's Worth Instead of ripping into character depth and story line, the overall point this movie delivered is an hour and 47 min of action packed thrill in 3D. It is not often your able to go to a movie theater, pay for overpriced tickets, popcorn, and dirty theaters and get completely absorbed into a movie and walk out feeling like that was worth my money and time. As for the common denominator for these kind of movies, at least the daughter no longer needs pull ups after the world was destroyed. Keep in mind, the length of this movie also keeps the momentum of action, where as the director did not fill the void by insulting the audiences intelligence.garbage, garbage, garbage....must be fake reviews posted here. absolute garbage. hey im a rock fan, i like a fair few of his movies for some dumb fun. i even found 2012 (another disaster movie with no soul) slightly entertaining. but man o man did this movie make me want to puke. the writers try to make you care about the lead (Dwayne), his ex-wife and his daughter but really half way through the movie i was wishing they all die in the end. blake's boyfriend (dunno know his name, forgot), and his brother, oh man they just need to die asap. the little brother accent, acting everything was unbearable. the CGI is good, but still watch 2012 if you want CGI, essentially the same movie. i don't get it the writers and director want to make want the main characters to survive but they are all so unlikable. in the movie you find ray's ex-wife with some rich architect, immediately you think 'gold digger', and same for the daughter who is sun bathing in rich mans back yard. the ray guy when the excrement hits the fan, is flying over millions of people in immediate need, some probably close to death, to go on a journey to find his daughter, reminds me of a quote from interstellar (now there's a movie) 'Evolution has yet to transcend this simple barrier. We can care deeply, selflessly about those we know. But that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight.'. that quote sums up the characters in this movie, they are all looking out for number one, and at best number two, unlikable characters. cheesy moments and lines are through the roof, riddled with clich√©s (surprise, surprise). there is no redeeming feature of the movie, its so bad id rather watch tooth fairy than this garbage. save your self the torture, you owe it to your self.Great Family Action Movie There are some movies I watch for critical acclaim ... and there are some movies that I watch for pure fun and entertainment. San Andreas is obviously the latter and my entire family simply loved it. Like all action movies, you have to suspend some belief and avoid taking it too seriously. However, within the realm of disbelief, San Andreas stays believable and you find yourself pulling for the characters to make it .. which isn't as obvious as you might think. Special effects are downright spectacular while avoiding going over the top. If you're looking for a night of fun at the movies with friends or family in the next couple of weeks, San Andreas is a 10 ... not an Oscar 10 ... but a fun, thrill ride 10.It was like the best part of every action/disaster movie for 2 hours Yes, The Rock says every single clich√©d action movie line I can remember. And yes, every one is hilariously predictable. Yes, the hot girl is wet and her cleavage is showing for most of the movie. Yes, every shot is crammed with mind-numbing amounts of CGI. Normally that bothers me, in this movie it just works. If you see it in 3D you will be drooling. Go see it right now, seeing this in theaters is the absolute best waste of 2 hours you will spend all year, and I am extremely confident that you will have fun. Remember that moment in Independence Day when the aliens blew up the white house? or in the Dark Knight when batman flips the whole 18 wheeler front-ways with his motorcycle? or how about when the entire city of London was demolished in GI Joe Retaliation? the handful of cool scenes in that weird Godzilla reboot? San Andreas is basically 2 hours of jaw-dropping destruction, epic sequences, death scenes, and interspersed one-liners. It's great. I'd watch the whole thing again right now. See it while it's in theaters. Don't think about it, just go.This is the disaster movie of disaster movies. This is a great movie. It shows an entire city not only being hit by the biggest and strongest earthquake in history but then hit by a three hundred foot high tsunami that finishes the job. This is the disaster movie of disaster movies. No need for a strong story here. The special effects provide more than enough drama. The actual characters in the movie are ancillary to the story. It's about nature going wild, and on a scale that is beyond measuring. At the conclusion of the movie, San Francisco is a mess. Paul Giamatti is fantastic, and also quite amusing, as the scientist who predicts that the earthquake will strike - and nobody believes him until it is too late. By that time, the Hoover Dam is history and the rest of California is next in line. LA also gets hit, hard, but the director saves the best special effects for San Francisco. If you like movies that show total devastation, then this movie is for you. This movie delivers, or rather obliterates the goods!Great Movie Went with high expectations just from seeing the trailer.And I can say I was not disappointed at all. The storyline was great the effects of the movie was AWESOME. I saw it in 3D and jumped a few times in the movie it kept me on the edge of my seat. I was extremely impressed in the acting and the sets of the movie. It doesn't matter if the science is shaky. We all go to the movie to enjoy them not to be picking it apart over science. I can see this actually happening sometime in the future. The only problem I had was with the tidal wave was that it would have crossed the ocean more than flood the city.Other then that it was a really good movie.6/10 If you understand what a disaster movie is about and how it works you will go and have a nice experience just as I did, certainly superior to the "2012" or "Day After Tomorrow" dullness. The usual cheesiness in disaster movie is there, the characters are so stereotypical it's hardly believable and worst of all it commits the usual, stupid mistake of having characters make it out of a situation just in time before everything collapses. This mistakes really annoys me firstly because it repeats itself a dozen times in the film but most of all because it's worthless: it does not add stakes or tension, they would be exactly the same, but except for maybe twice in the film situations get resolved just in time and the uselessness of it really annoyed me. The film tries too hard to give it's characters depth and barely succeeds in it. I cannot deny I was rooting for them, that maybe being due to the fact that the actors involved are honestly all doing a good enough job, but the fact that it tries to achieve character empathy through clich√©s that have been present in cinema since the beginning of time is ridiculous. That being said, it does deliver the goods of a disaster movie and delivers them much more competently than the recent disaster films we have seen on the big screen. With the exception of the finale where things are unnecessarily blown up to eleven, there isn't exaggeration. The set pieces are for the major part breath-taking and original enough. I counted actually two times where my mouth totally dropped in genuine amazement. I was riveted by many scenes and this is probably due to the fact that the director never overuses CGI. It is used in the perfect dose, there is enough practicality involved and the fact that the set pieces aren't always the biggest most blown up ones made it better, it gave the film more stakes. Moreover there is a great use of long takes in certain parts of the film, one in particular is very long and threw me right into the action like no other disaster movie ever had done before. If you know what you are in for you will have a good time and you will be given back your money's worth, you won't want to be re-watching this movie anytime, but that is perfectly fine and fits the film in what it is trying to achieve.Ignore the naysayers and definitely go and see San Andreas! I usually read the bad reviews before seeing a movie, so definitely read them and then still go and see San Andreas. It is a viably entertaining series of events that leap from one catastrophe to the utter destruction of San Francisco. If you ever wanted to see the peninsula of San Francisco go up in smoke Sodom and Gomorrah Style?! Then this is the film to see it happen.  I mean the gay old city of Saint Francis by the Sea, literally wiped clean with the help of the Pacific, or at least that's what the viewer might infer from some of the smaller lines of the people in the aftermath.  And what about that Hugo Johnstone-Burt! Talk about a man in a baby blue button up shirt you want around when the California fault lines open up. The only disappointment was that Hugo didn't take his wet shirt off being the ever able British gentlemen caring for his young lad brother. The Rock, well what can you say? When you want a Rock to stand on, Dwayne Johnson is your man. Carla Gugino and Alexandra Daddario, the mother and daughter troupe ‚Äì Bravo! The script wasn't much to work with, and the viewer may not have wanted to know either you before the first earthquake, but definitely, Ms. Gugino WAS Dwayne's wife. When all hell breaks loose, she sternly faces death valiantly as her white knight battles falling sky scrapers and dares gigantic waves to defeat them. And Miss Daddario, like mother like daughter. And finally, Paul Giamatti, ladies and gentlemen... Text book Scholar and Savior, using his staff and his university's resources in a tight spot to save the Bay and the Coast from what could very well be the re- alignment of Golden State. This is everything all the other movies of 2015 thus far have lacked, someone to root for amidst the ruin of the City named for Saint Francis in San Andreas.Why a ten and why you should see it while in theaters. This move gets a 10 simply because it does everything it set out to do and does it well. In fact, very well. I don't know of any disaster film that comes close to this. There is no bogus 40 minute long back story prior to the action, and all the characters are developed just enough when there is a brief pause in the action. This is the Rock's movie, and that's a good thing. I won't say he's a great actor but - as he instructed so many others to do while he was in the WWE wrestling biz - he knows his role. The guy has a screen presence as big as Arnold or Stallone ever had and he can speak well. I won't tell any stuff that goes on, but some times there is so much happening on screen I was glad to be seeing on the big screen. One thing I will say is that I watched the whole movie without finding any flaws or disappointing moments. there are a lot of great movies that you can simply wait and see on DVD, or on a PC or whatever. This should be seen big screen. It is a very well crafted piece of work and entertains better than probably most other movies that will be released this summer.sick one Dwayne This was a premium film, full of premium banter. There was an abundance of great characters, including British- mark- wahlberg-Jeremy-renner-man-crossover, and good old Dwayne himself. Dwayne looks fresh as can be, wearing those yeezys like he was born to. Not to mention his aviators which he wore for like five minutes, but were worn with style. He also manages to be a realistic hard helicopter man, despite the fact that he will never be as muscular as Paul. There was an abundance of destruction in this film, it was like a Michael bay wet dream, but a realistic wet dream. Talking of wet, Dwayne caught some gnarly waves in that tsunami, totally rad. And the mister fantastic face got what was coming to him. Rip Dwayne's helicopter. It will be missed, he rescued all if two people in it. Rip Dwayne's house, it got totally leveled. It was like a geological bulldozer had ran through the city. This film was better than 2012, and pays tribute to Paul walker and the Nepal earthquake of recent. Except in San Andreas people living continents away don't mark themselves as safe on Facebook, unlike Nepal. Overall, 20/10 would film againPowerful Disaster Film and Important Cautionary Tale San Andreas is a spectacular disaster film that blends breathtaking special effects with heart rending personal stories of incredible power. An overwhelming saga of a state devastated by monstrous earthquakes, resulting in stunning vistas of unprecedented destruction so vast that they are difficult to emotionally process. Technically, there is no doubt this is a brilliantly made and directed movie. However, it is the human element that creates the tension and suspense as characters for whom we care struggle for survival against a panorama of immense ruin. Carla Gugino shines as the wife of Dwayne Johnson, giving a moving performance of tremendous power as a woman desperate to save her family. Gugino lights up every scene in which she appears and the camera loves her. Johnson does well in his part as a helicopter pilot and first responder who faces the greatest challenge of his professional and personal life. A film that serves as a quite profound cautionary tale as well as a story of high adventure, San Andreas is a superb film that succeeds as a drama as well as the finest disaster movie to come out of Hollywood in decades.Not A High Point For The Genre Dwayne The Rock Johnson is an actor whom I like. He seems like one of the nicer celebrities out there, but for some reason his movies just seem bland, and dont interest me that much. Outside of one Fast &amp; Furious movie (whatever the last Paul Walker one was) I have not seen a movie starring him since Faster in 2010. So I decided to give San Andreas a go when I spotted it on Netflix tonight.  Sadly it was as bland as I imagined!! Plenty of innocents who we didn't care about bit the dust, but the main cast all survived with just a few scratches. OK I wasn't happy Kylie Minogue came and went so quickly, but I'm probably in the minority in that one!! At times the effects looked decent, but at others not so much. All in all, I found it to be a bland by the numbers disaster movie. All I took away from it was I will always have a crush on Carla Gugino and Alexandra Daddario (the actress playing The Rocks daughter) is HOT!!All out action...down to a fault. Ok, so what can I say? If you enjoy pure action, high drama and a barrowload of coincidences and near misses then this is the film for you. I lost count the number of times someone escaped by the skin of their teeth sheer moments before a building collapsed or a bridge or a ship comes careering up Main street. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad film, it's just all so predictable and gung ho and overly 'YEAH USA, USA, USA'. Sometimes it would be good to watch an Action film that perhaps wasn't quite as far fetched as Hollywood seems to like. The ease at which buildings were ripped apart like sheets of paper was frightening. Surely in an area such as San Francisco which is in a high risk Earthquake zone buildings are constructed to a standard so as to be resistant to tremors. The buildings here were destroyed like the Three Pigs house of Straw. No building or structure escaped undamaged and that just simply wouldn't happen. Much of the film was well acted, i'm beginning to become a bit of a fan of Dwayne Johnson, he's not a bad actor in the films I've seen him in ( other than the Mummy/Scorpion King which were just really bad films), Alexandra Daddario seems fairly versatile in her acting and done a decent job here... On the whole there were no major complaints about the acting ability of the cast, perhaps the direction left a bit to be desired at times, but you can't blame the Actors for that. Some of the effects were well executed, the rippling of the ground as the tremors struck was nicely done, though as mentioned earlier they went a bit OTT with the destruction side of things. Overall not bad as a film, as a piece of eye candy not to be taken seriously. But please, Hollywood, can we have a change from the norm. This type of film could be excellent but they rely far too heavily on these coincidental occurrences tightly packed into the 90 minutes and often the storyline ends up lacking.A steaming pile of dog faeces A very disappointing and lazy film. It had the usual kill off the ethnic minorities first, shame women for divorcing, stereotypical and boring men always saving the helpless women claptrap that we've become accustomed to.  The effects were good, but that's where the compliments end. None of the characters were developed properly, and I had to stop myself from falling asleep at watching the predictable and boring love stories unfold. I was rather hoping that the boring and insufferable daughter Blake would be killed off after being (understandably) abandoned in the parking lot by her mothers boyfriend, but no, there was the bumbling English fool that had just met her there to save her.  I stopped watching after that, and I would implore you to watch paint dry rather than turn on this drivel.10 Things I Learned ...from San Andreas. 1. Buildings, roads and dams will crumble &amp; fail just seconds into an earthquake. 2. You only need to be a couple of feet off the main structure of a collapsing dam to be safe from imminent death.  3. Bursting a car's rear tyres will unpin a passenger trapped by an interior car seat. 4. Once rescued, aforementioned passenger will be just fine despite being pinned by their legs so tightly they could not move. 5. Cell phones will be useless but somehow landlines will still work. 6. It is possible to just walk into a small aircraft hanger and make-off with a plane. 7. Someone needs to dramatically shout "TAKE COVER!" at the onset of an earthquake, you know - just in case it wasn't obvious by all the shaking and falling debris. 8. The actors trying to pull off an English accent obviously went to the Dick Van Dyke School of Acting. 9. Climbing a 1000ft tidal wave whilst avoiding an oncoming shipping vessel dropping it's heavy cargo is totally achievable in a pontoon. 10. Kylie Minogue did not need to be in this movie. 6/10 for the special effects. Leave your brain at the door.San Andreas is an average disaster film with some impressive visuals and enjoyable performance by Dwayne Johnson. San Andreas: Movie Review. San Andreas is an okay film with some spectacular stunning visuals and effects and an amazing 3D, and entertaining performance by Dwayne Johnson. San Andreas has some epic disaster action visuals and visual style but offers nothing more than that. Dwayne Johnson delivers an enjoyable performance but seems and feel very underutilized at certain times. The rest of the cast and characters feels very underdeveloped. The movie also has some very unnecessary, boring and irritating characters that are totally useless in the film.  San Andreas has many flaws and issues. The movie falls back in the terms of story plot, script and character development and lack of script originality in a disaster movie. And some times too much over use CGI effects in the movie makes it little bit of less interesting. (Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You).The Worst First Respoonder San Andreas This is a movie about "The Big One", a huge earthquake in California. It focuses on The Rock who plays the worst first responder in the history of first responders. In the beginning they show him saving a young woman from a dramatic car accident without any regard to the spinal injury that she would have had to have suffered in such a horrific accident. Then when the earthquake hits, instead of reporting for duty to coordinate rescue efforts, he abandons his responsibilities and steals a rescue helicopter and uses it for personal use. He's just awful, and I cringe at such a horrible person this character is meanwhile being thankful for the many, many unselfish first responders who help people in need. But it's an exciting movie with a lot of special effects so it's fun to watch if you can stand this evil main character.Earthquake and a Sunami Raymond/Ray Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) is in the LA Fire Departent Air Rescue when the San Andreas fault causes the mother of all earthquakes and triggers a Sunami. This is another earthquake film in which the main characters are in the midst of divorce and find themselves together trying to save their offspring who is in peril.  Great special effects. Good film for family viewing with tweeners on the weekend, has something for everyone.Sorry Dwayne! I have to start by saying that I do ten to watch anything that Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is in. For someone primarily known as an action star (and former wrestler to boot!) he does tend to offer *slightly* more range in the acting stakes than some of his contemporaries. Here, in 'San Andreas,' he doesn't have to utilise an awful lot of acting ability to portray a tough-as-nails helicopter pilot who must utilise his aerial skills to save his family when a freak earthquake hits the city. Yes, that's about the size of the plot. Anyway, I knew what I was getting. I've seen enough disaster movies to know the score ‚Äì the actors normally come secondary to the special effects. And this film was no different. I began by actually quite enjoying the film. It doesn't take long before buildings start crumbling on a large scale and, when this happens, the special effects are indeed well done enough to at least make the devastation appear believable. Plus you have the ever-great Dwayne Johnson at the helm, who, as I've said, is always fun. However, it was about there that the fun started to come to an end. There's little even Johnson and the special effects department could do to prevent not only the city of San Andreas, but also the entire film, from slipping into oblivion. It was about a quarter into the film when I started asking the question: Is this film trying to be serious, or not? You see¬Ö these kind of disaster movies do follow patterns, or to put it a little harsher, have their own clich√©s. And 'San Andreas' starts to conform to so many of these that I was left wondering if they were checking every box on purpose in some sort of 'self knowing' kind of way. Sadly, by the end of the film I can confirm that they never had their tongue anywhere near their cheek. Once the disaster is underway, we're also treated to the couple who have split up getting back together, their subsequent inability to die while all around them drop like flies and the search for the child in danger. Now, I could almost forgive all of those if it wasn't for the fact that some actors appeared to be doing possibly the worst British actors since Dick Van Dyke! (Feel free to correct me and look them up online and inform me that they really WERE true Brits ‚Äì but I'd be shocked!) So, a film that could have been really good fun was only reasonably due to Johnson and the effects. It's a shame that they couldn't have at least tried to make the sub-plots a little more original, as it makes the film pretty forgettable if you've seen as many disaster movies as I have. Plus Paul Giamatti was wasted and only there to try and give the film more of an air of gravitas.Predictable with poor special effects The punchlines were predictable and corny, though the acting was fine. When the blond's car went tomahawking down the cliff, it looked really fake, like it was either computer-generated or controlled by a cable. How does the brunette remain scratch-less as she plummets on the roof just long enough for The Rock to pull her up out of the mess with his chopper? And of course the main blond who's stuck in the basement is rescued by the boys who decided they can't leave her (because she's a hottie) and is revived at the end by CPR. If she wasn't pretty, the boys would've said, "To heck with this, we're out of here." All in all, this was really predictable, corny, and thriller-typical.If you wanted a plot, you've come to the wrong place I'm afraid the opening sequence of this movie sets the tone for the rest of it. Admittedly, some of the CGI within the movie is much better than the pathetic offering in the car crash scene, but there is still very little to offer unless you just want to see mindless explosions and buildings falling down. When watching this film, it was so hard not to compare it to others of the same genre (The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 were the two that sprung to mind). And, I'm afraid San Andreas never gets close to being anywhere near their standard (and they are hardly world beaters!) My main problems are that the character development is none existent which renders you totally ambivalent to any of the characters in the film. If they live or die could not have bothered me less. And also, the cheesy dialogue and overacting is something you've seen a million times before. For me, it is the poorest in a long line of disaster movies that tried to pin it's hopes on Dwayne Johnson, but I just didn't buy into him as this sort of character, so the film was flat from the start.Pure action, no acting allowed Compared to The Rock, Arnold Schwarzenegger is like Sir Lawrence Olivier. His acting is like a, well, professional wrestler. The Rock only proves how low we have set the bar on movie entertainment. However in that aspect, this film is long on action, and little else. My "5-Star" review is for the special effects ONLY. I doubt that anything starring The Rock would be good for much else; the CGI is mighty spectacular, just as you would expect. It was realistic enough to put you off your trip to LA, or at least re-think it. If I was the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, I'd try to have this movie banned. But if pure violent action, thrills, and mayhem is your goal, this film certainly fills the bill.Complete pile of pap This movie is shockingly bad. It is so utterly cheesy and corny it makes you cringe so much that you're doubled up on the floor. Dwayne Johnson cannot save this one. Right from the start it's ridiculous as a young woman in a car who isn't looking where she's going has the most horrific crash you've ever seen and LIVES!! I mean the car rolls about 50 times as it crashes down a massive cliff and she's thrown about like a rag doll but oh she's fine!  The movie improves slightly as Dwayne Johnson enters as a superbly talented helicopter pilot and does some nifty moves to save the miraculous survivor. Also the earthquake monitoring people are engaging, the special effects for the hoover dam scenes are very good. However after those initial introductions it all goes down hill as Dwayne Johnson's character pines over his ex (soon to be divorced) wife and is shown as perfect daddy to his model-like daughter. Johnson manages to have a helicopter all to himself and miraculously rescue his own (soon to be) ex-wife and go on a mission to find their perfect daughter together.  What a pile of pap. Really.Worthless The acting was terrible. The story was badly written and completely predictable. The effects are like something out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. What a waste of time. I couldn't even watch to the halfway point it was so useless. How this got rated higher than 4/10 stars is completely beyond me. I wish I'd never set eyes on this film. It is likely to leave a bad taste in my mouth for weeks.pathetic pathetic movie for dumb audience, don't understand why the hell Rock was only at the back of his family and not trying to save other people from disaster.it is so mean and doesn't suit the character on hulk like Dwayne Johson.only in one meeting with girl the 2nd lead is ready to sacrifice his life to save the girl from under parking and fall in luv with her.does it make sense :D the subject was good but due to poor screen play and story line i will give only 4 starts to this movie and don't suggest people to watch.wow... to be quick: all the people involved in this movie (director, producer, writer, actors, FX artists, technicians, chopper pilots, car dealers, toilet cleaners,...) should be banned for life to be involved in another movie. Also all the viewers (including myself who watched at this movie on TV because I had nothing to do on a thursday night) should be sentenced to watch at all The Rock movies (but maybe this would be a crime against humanity).This movie IS the disaster. I was overly excited when I fished my new copy of this utterly ridiculous disaster flick out of the $3.79 movie bin at Wal Mart. I am quite convinced that after suffering through this drivel I deserve a refund of the purchase price; $1000.00 per minute for every excruciating 60 seconds of it's 114 minute run time I lost from my life that I will never get back; punitive damages for the death of many brave brain cells and a signed apology from the director. Take a lesson from my book and avoid this flick at all costs; your gray matter will thank me. This drivel requires a healthy dose of the suspension of disbelief...so much so that the creators could have saved time and the watchers sanity by issuing an emergency morphine pill with every viewing of this cinematic catastrophe. JUST SAY NO!!!!!!!!Proof Positive Humans are Dumb as F#$%! The only reason to watch this blatant, yet worse than, replica 70s disaster piece (as in piece of...) is to watch LA and San Francisco be destroyed along with all of the pretentious f#$%'s who live there with it. Dwayne J. is okay. But really, if your here for the acting...why are you here? Clich√© after clich√© with heroes and villains and plucky snot nosed side-kick brats and pretty, young, nubile daughters make up this predictable turd of a film. I'm only even mentioning it now because my wife is downstairs watching it and I caught some of it and threw up dinner.  I originally saw it when it came out only because my wife wanted to see it and because it was set here in SF, and why would I want to miss seeing a tsunami engulf the entire Bay? It is amazing how much crap movies like this can make a fortune when good thoughtful films are ignored. But I knew this. Hell, I grew up in So. Cal. What did I expect...taste?Mother of all Disasters Amongst all disaster movies I have seen in the last 2 decades, this will get a prominent spot. But one which puts this movie really into the top position of the most dumb movies ever seen. Yes, this movie has managed to actually beat 2012. I even find The Core as a way better movie than this one, which is a complete waste of time. For one - the movie is absolutely unbelievable. Hell, even Sharknado seems like a scientifically researched movie against this. And while in every single disaster movie you know from the beginning, that a disaster will strike, you still can incorporate some twists, some unpredictable and entertaining storyline into the movie. Clearly, this was not the case in San Andreas - the disastrous disaster movie. But lets go step by step - opening scene - a girl drives in her car and does all the stupid things you should not do while driving. The only surprising thing is that her crash happens only on the 3rd time she does some stupidity. But from the first second you knew she will crash. Our hero - The Rock - immediately comes to the rescue while her heavy American built SUV is being held above an abyss by one tiny winy tree branch which would hardly hold an adult American person. But with some totally unbelievable airmanship, our hero positions his chopper in a way to rescue this poor girl in the last second.  And then things go on like this - totally predictable - disaster strikes and in the last second our heroes manage to save themself or be saved by Dwayne. The amazing thing is that everybody else is totally dumb and despite super strong earthquake, the folks in San Francisco head down to the bay to be rescued - like no one ever heard of a tsunami, which would be so obvious with a 9+ earthquake. But guess this is not elementary knowledge to anyone around. And while buildings around keep collapsing like the architects would never even consider risk of an earthquake in SanFran, you see how Dwayne actually keeps stealing cars, boats just in order to save his two kids. And totally unpredictable - despite not having a way to contact them, he manages to find them. Better said - the kids use a laser pointer to signal him, but he and his wife took almost 2 minutes to actually look around and notice them, because yes, its so important to discuss - hey darling, whats this, oh, a green dot, lets pretend we are cats and try to catch it. Every normal person would virtually immediately turn around and look for the source.  But considering how stupid everybody around acts, the viewer of this movie should not be surprised about that. And neither should be about the typical dumb ending of the movie - because - nothing is more important after a huge disaster, than to raise the US flag onto the collapsed Golden gate bridge - I mean - you guys have them always handy so that they can get raised immediately after disaster strikes? So, the real issue of this movie is, that there is never any suspense. There is never any association of the viewers with the poorly developed characters. The storyline is absolutely not entertaining and forgettable, CGI effects are nothing to write back home about. So unless you really want to torture yourself, just simply ignore this movie and watch something elseDo ya' smell what the fault is cookin'? Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson stars in this action-packed motion picture about the San Andreas fault line ripping California apart with the biggest earthquake to hit the United States ever! Now before you science geeks start ripping this movie apart, remember it's just a popcorn movie. It's supposed to have cool special effects. It's supposed to have a hero. It's supposed to have some cheesy lines. But it also accomplished what it was set out to do which was give the audience a fun, wild ride. As far as character depth and Oscar-nominated acting, not needed in this one. A big natural disaster is about to hit. No time to think about how hurt this person is or why the rules aren't fair. And absolutely no time for a scientific explanation. Keep the action going and let's all do like Iron Maiden and run to the hills. Don't listen to most of the reviews on this one. Watch it, heat up some popcorn, and bring the kids out for a good old fashion movie time night with the family.A Tribute To Irwin Allen An earthquake rocks California. When I first heard that Dwayne Johnson was going to be the star of this flick I had some concerns over the casting, you see I am a bit old school in my disaster movie tastes and someone like the late Chuck Heston the late Paul Newman seemed to be the expected guy for a film like this. However, to my surprise, Johnson did the hero role very well, and I actually love San Andreas! The whole cast is wonderful. I don't usually love these CGI epics but the film is a refreshing tribute to Irwin Allen of the 1970s and that alone is something that makes me very happy.  Attention Hollywood: please make more movies like this, but for the next epic please find a film composer who scores like John Williams or the late Jerry Goldsmith. Thanks.There is Mother Nature, and then there is Raymond Gaines... Right, well there is no doubt about it, that this 2015 disaster movie was going to be one of those by-the-book disaster movies that end up being so predictable that even a blind man knows what will happen way before it did on the screen. And sure enough, director Brad Peyton didn't fail to live up to that and deliver a very predictable movie. With that being said, I am not saying that "San Andreas" is a bad movie. Actually it was very, very enjoyable. It was so predictable that it was actually becoming fun to watch and bet on what would happen throughout the movie. But also the special effects. This certainly was a Hollywood CGI and special effects galore from start to end. And it was the special effects that kept the movie afloat, pardon the pun. The story is about a shift on the tectonic plates which cause several massive earthquakes to strike the coast of USA, causing unprecedented damage to cities and the country. And in the middle of all the chaos and destruction is Raymond Gaines (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Emma Gaines (played by Carla Gugino) in a desperate search for their daughter Blake Gaines (played by Alexandra Daddario). You know how this movie turns out even way before you actually press the play button on the remote. But still, just sit back and enjoy all the action and the special effects, because it really is breathtaking. If you enjoyed the "2012" movie - the one with John Cusack - then you will most definitely also enjoy "San Andreas". As I have mentioned already, then this is first and foremost a CGI and special effects movie, and a huge chunk of credit should really be given to the CGI and special effects team for what they pulled off here. It was an amazing ride to sit through this movie, because all the destruction and mayhem looked so realistic and so awesome. But one thing that puzzled me was the lack of human bodies. Wouldn't there be lots and lots of dead people around in the debris and floating around in the water? Oddly enough there was very, very little of that to be seen. It was a shame, because it would have been a nice and realistic detail to the movie. The acting in the movie was good, and I think that Dwayne Johnson did an okay job here, although it wasn't his best of performances. It was, however, Paul Giamatti (playing Dr. Lawrence Hayes) who put on the most memorable performance in the movie. And it was also a nice thing to watch Ioan Gruffudd (playing Daniel Riddick) in a role such as the one he had in this movie. "San Andreas" is not a movie that challenges the intellect of the audience in any way, but it is a thrill ride that is more than worth to sit through. And while the movie is permeated by a sense of Dwayne Johnson's character being of almost super-human proportions and can handle everything that Mother Nature throws against him, it is still an enjoyable movie. Just don't think too much about what is going on around you on the screen, just sit back and enjoy the ride.San Andreas Review San Andreas(2015) Starring: Dwayne Johnson, Carla Guino, Alexandra Daddario, Ioan Gruffudd, Archie Panjabi, Paul Giammiti, Hugo John- stone Burt, Art Parkinson, Will Yun Lee, Kylie Minogue, Colton Haynes, Todd Williams, Matt Gerald, Alec Utgoff, and Marissa Neitling Written By: Carlton Cuse, Andre Farbrizo, and Jerry Passmore Directed By: Brad Peyton Review When I was like a little kid their was this disaster movie I wanted to see called The Day After Tomorrow, years later I saw 2012, and just now I've watched this. I bring up the other two disaster movies because I honestly think that I need to watch all of these films in a loop to decide which is the best cause I haven't seen 2012 or The Day After Tomorrow in a while. This film is about Dwayne The ROCK Johnson who plays a rescue man and when San Francisco is hit with the biggest rated earthquake in history must find his daughter through a city that is shattering and rescue her. In movies like these the star of the movie is not the actor but the effects and destruction this was a big thing in the 90's and they ranged from Independence Day, Zilla 98, and Twister. Most disaster films I probably haven't seen and sadly Twister is one of them cause I 've always wanted to see that. If you like Dwayne The Rock Johnson or some of the disaster films I mentioned then you might probably cause it's better than most of them I'm giving San Andreas a two and a half out of five.A typical disaster movie with well-conceived, frightening graphics but minimum logic and emotions. Beginning with a superb rescue scene of a car hanging from a cliff, SAN ANDREAS impresses a lot before it moves ahead to the terrifying earthquake hitting the city with a never before magnitude of 9.6. And from here onwards the film becomes a mixed bag with some visible merits as well as many major flaws served together to the audience loving this particular genre. To give you a better picture, if you are only interested in watching frightening graphics showcasing an entire region getting flattened by the major earthquake, brilliantly depicted by the VFX and the action director together, then SAN ANDREAS might turn out to be a fine exciting watch bringing you on to the edge of your seat repeatedly. Having a widespread destruction show to offer with excellent visuals of tremors, falling skyscrapers, blown up bridges, roads and a lot more slickly edited together, it unarguably scores much higher in this most significant (CGI) department of a disaster movie. But in case you are expecting an engrossing, realistic watch with a great mix of courage, emotions and fear then SAN ANDREAS honestly turns out to be nothing more than a technically sound, typical disaster film made on a dumb script. And the word 'dumb' is being used here since we have a whole city knocked down drastically but without any sight of thousands of people dying or bodies lying all over (as a bloodless show). Moreover here we also have the lead character of a strong, professional fire-and-rescue pilot, who simply forgets about his official duty or anybody else dying around (looking from his helicopter flying over the affected area) and is only interested in saving his two family members alone caught in one of those falling buildings like an unkind, mean human. Having said that many might not like to think about it in this logical way since the character has been really played well by the likable Dwayne Johnson along with a decent supporting cast trying hard to portray their given role convincingly. But actually that's not how we are supposed to see/visualize a tragic natural disaster with such a self-centered approach as per my personal opinion. In other words, though the film gets largely saved by its lead performance, action and graphics department put together, it's the lack of realistic/logical execution by its director Brad Peyton or the missing emotional depth in its one dimensional approach that doesn't allow you to give SAN ANDREAS any higher rating than an average film.Not enough characters I was ambivalent about this one. The special effects were great, and that was what I came to see so I was more or less satisfied. The Golden Gate Bridge was in the wrong place and can't actually be seen from the Coit Tower area, but you can't have everything. Still, the movie was missing something. And after I thought about it, I realized that the missing element was character conflict. In the good old days of disaster movies (think "The Towering Inferno" and the original "Poseidon Adventure"), you had a whole bunch of very different characters, often in conflict with one another, some of them even "bad guys" working at complete cross purposes, and that made the movie much more interesting against the backdrop of the disaster. In "San Andreas", the very few main characters have exactly the same goal, and most of them are even from the same family. (The two that aren't, want to be.) The lack of character conflict hurt this movie, and the cowardly boyfriend wasn't in it long enough to be of much help. Yeah, the effects were great. But for me, that wasn't enough to make for a really good movie. Maybe that's the way they do it these days, with a single big star making it "his" movie without any on-screen competition, but I prefer the old ensemble-cast way of doing it, with several major stars playing strong characters who each have his or her own personal goals and subplot, with everything tying into the main theme. A really good disaster movie needs more than special effects. "The Poseidon Adventure" only had two, but it remains one of the best examples of the genre because of the outstanding cast and excellent story-telling.It's overblown and exaggerated, but it's also entertaining and has a premise that isn't as detached from reality as many people may think When a massive earthquake hits California, rescue pilot Raymond Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) finds himself in a race-against-time battle to try to rescue his ex-wife Emma (Carla Gugino) and daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario). Meanwhile, following the aftermath of the first earthquake Doctor Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) and his team believe that they have found a way of detecting where earthquakes are going to happen prior to them 'happening' and make it their mission to warn everyone to get out of San Francisco while they still can. If you strip this film down to its bare bones this is a fairly generic action film; heroic protagonist must try to rescue his family (in this case though rather than protecting them from a villain he is trying to rescue them from Mother Nature which is an altogether more terrifying prospect). I think what makes this film more terrifying lies in the fact that it could actually happen; San Francisco is on a major fault line and has had its fair share of Earthquakes. In this film, all the filmmakers have done is slightly exaggerated this real-world problem and wrapped it up in a neat package that on the one hand is reasonably entertaining and on the other hand it provides us with nuggets of information explaining away what we are bearing witness to. In San Andreas, both of these elements compliment each other very well (the scientific aspect kept me informed without boring me and the rest of the narrative was strong enough to keep me involved in the story). One other thing that this film has in its favour is the likability of the characters; Ray is your typical action movie protagonist in that he's tough when required, but is also a man that is loving and devoted to his family. Likewise, it would have been so easy to make his daughter a 'weak damsel-in-distress character', but she's ballsy, resourceful and brave (which are all admirable traits and are things that give the film added weight). Whilst no-one gives a performance here worthy of an Oscar nod I have to admit that some of the acting here was really good; the ever reliable Paul Giamatti was excellent. Dwayne Johnson can do tough-guy stuff in his sleep, but I was surprised at how good he was at the emotive stuff. All the supporting cast were also fine as well. Although San Andreas is a good film in the main there were a few weaknesses here and there; for a start, I got the impression at times that director Brad Peyton was a little too in love with the special effects side of things (there was clearly a lot of money thrown at this project and I felt that Peyton wanted everyone to know that). Also Emma's husband serves no real purpose in the story (after we bear witness to his cowardice), but yet we're still shown scenes of him later trying to survive the Earthquake - although there is a wonderful example of Karma surrounding his character later in the film so his inclusion in later scenes is both good and bad. San Andreas is not a brilliant film and it is far from perfect, but it is an entertaining film that covers its 110 minute running time effortlessly. Yes it's a bit cheesy, clich√©d, exaggerated and overblown, but it's also a film that I felt had something to say and that is just one of the reasons that I feel makes this film work reasonably well.worst acting, predictable plot, special effects ok The director must have gone to some length to find a giant Maori bodybuilding martial arts expert actor who can fly a helicoper, drive a car, fly an airoplane, steer a boat, jump parachute, hold his breath for a minut while swimming and tearing buildings apart but who can't act.Solid movie Sure the film is not meant for a huge complex audience or even to win awards, it's meant to be a feel good, suspenseful action disaster movie. There was a lot of negative critical reviews but I, personally, can't see what or where that has come from.  The CGI is good and realistic. The plot is fairly solid and the acting is good. Dwayne johnsons performance is good. So are the other cast members.  Overall the age rating to the film is agreeable. The violence is not too graphic but not suitable for audiences under 10. Language isn't perfect with one f word and other milder profanity. The film is very intense throughout.  Overall my verdict to the film is that it is a very good, feel good, emotional, rollercoaster thrill ride of a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat.A perfect popcorn blockbuster This is a great Hollywood movie and pretty sure everyone expects the "kind" of movie San Andreas actually is. It follows basically the same rules, movies such as The Day After Tomorrow or 2012 (or any other disaster movie coming from Hollywood for that matter) went ahead before. The daddy has trouble with mommy and the kids are not close when the drama starts. Therefore daddy goes on an impossible mission to save the kid, explosions and destruction follow his path and no matter how troubled the world may be... there is always time for a love story in between, right? The CGI looks cool though and the sound is just fine. You will find yourself surprisingly caring a lot for the main chatacters and San Andreas is a perfect popcorn blockbuster. After all it is a movie that stars The Rock and that is exactly what you get.Blockbuster Hit Great movie! Nice job Dwayne Johnson and this movie had one of the best scenes of earthquakes. It is a survival thriller and is very fun and I recommend you to watch this.Action Packed I saw the premiere a couple of nights ago and while I hadn't heard much about the film, I was pleasantly surprised. An apocalyptic film isn't exactly a new or unique idea but this one still pulled it off. If you're a bit of an action-junkie like myself, you'll probably like this one with its non-stop action right through the film. While some of it may seem a little over the top, it is what it is. A "Rock" action film. I also didn't mind the rest of the cast in their roles and everyone seemed to pull their weight.  If you liked movies such as 2012 and Day After Tomorrow, just want to watch something and enjoy an action-packed movie then you should give this one a go.The Day After Tomorrow, 2012, World War Z‚ÄîSomewhat Likable. San Andreas‚ÄîUtter BS! Equivocal. Obvious. Balony. Couldn't be any worse. The underlying principle behind all the caring-family-gets-past-everything stupidity is the hierarchical system of art that Brad Peyton sadly lacks. And sorry to say, such apocalyptic depictions are getting far worse than they used to be, or maybe people have started to like worse. Dwayne Johnson is not shoddier than he is supposed to be; he does what he's expected to: make his appearance, save the day, make some money, and there you go. And Carla Gugino's acting is always uncalled-for, so that's up to her usual standards, which are pretty below the line. San Andreas depicts the same rotten-tomato story of an ordinary yet exceptional man who risks everything and ventures into dark-holes and "plot-holes" to rescue people, including his daughter (who is miles from appearing so.) Where the whole "effing" world is collapsing and tumbling to the core, Mr. Shoulders (Ray) has the guts to get past everything without a single scratch. So that's how it goes. I know I'm supposed to be writing a movie review, but this movie is just pathetic, so much so that I'm constantly deviating from my goal here. As with Fifty Shades of Grey, in which Ellie Goulding's Fifty Shades of Grey totally had me, the only thing I found captivating in San Andreas was "California Dreamin'" by Sia‚Äîwhat a song that is, I mean totally. But even that song's congeniality to the movie is limited. They ruined it in the movie trailer, not the song, mind you, but the whole clip was just not so captivating. And now, they ruined it in the movie. It was better off away from this unaesthetic, mainstream, untalented piece of work. They just do that for the box-office, don't they? Last year it was Godzilla, and this year it's this. Hiring a famous cast, writing a visually entrancing plot, and releasing it in 3-D. Get lost, seriously! I watched Mad Max: Fury Road a couple of weeks ago. Its genres were almost the same. But the way they executed it is beyond words. Miller totally pulled it off. And here, it was just a money-grabbing, regular movie with a rigged ending. Brad Peyton has paved his way for many other visual-stuns, all of which will get slapped by critics, and lauded by ordinary audience, who value collective conscience related to reality more when they are watching a movie. C'mon guys. Beat yourself with baseball bats at home; don't come to the cinema if you want to learn a life lesson. It's not a Nolanized version; it's customary, lame, underdeveloped, and sorely lacking in moralism. And Brad, you want to teach a life session, get us ready for a destined apocalypse? Write a damn article in The New York Times. Don't waste our money, and cinemas' popcorn on something this stupid. Action and thriller movies constitute the essence of liveliness of cinemas. Drama-movies suit lessons. You don't get your backpacks ready by watching a 3-D action film that saves the actor/actress and kills everybody else. Why doesn't the apocalypse harm them? Why don't they get killed, or injured, or even remotely affected by the physiological and neurological tragedy that just occurred. At the end of everything, film-makers then raise their cameras from helicopters at 1000ft and try to prove how much they feel for everybody. You don't expect positive reviews only on the sidelines you've readied your earnings for. And I must not be criticized and see people "not finding my review useful" only because I didn't find anything good about the movie except its indication to a foreseeable dilemma, which is not really a critic's cuppa-tea. So in the end, San Andreas is a mundane Armageddon itself. It depicts itself, so to say. It's a catastrophe‚Äîan utter disappointment. 2012 had the same plot, World War Z is also remotely linked to it, and so are several other movies. With the exception of World War Z, which was unusually likable, despite the zombie-factor, every other such movie is aesthetically a disaster, a work of a philistine, and sick-and-span-ily misleading. Folding down, folding up, crumbling, disassembling, wide-ranging affect-zone‚Äîthe skyscraper effect, the hulking cruiser, jack-and-jazz buzz, ireful seawater, smashed-up barricades, barrages, dams, overturning, falling apart, dropping down into the crux, Paul Giamatti's teensy-tiny deliverance, and Alexandra Daddario's lion's share‚Äî*giggling*‚Äîare all I've liked about the movie. When you're in the cinema, these things rock you up. But at the end of the day, let's face it, the movie sucks badly!Not groundbreaking cinema, but it does suck you in "Science fiction films are not about science. They are about disaster, which is one of the oldest subjects of art." ‚Äï Susan Sontag Walking into the cinema... The Rock in a disaster film about falling and shifting rocks. Ironic? Get ready to turn off the brain, watch cities be destroyed, have fun and even have a good laugh.  Cinematic rating: 2.5 stars Reel Dialogue Rating: 2 stars Do we need another disaster film? When it comes to escapism, there is nothing like a good disaster film and it seems to be something that audiences want to see. Logic and physics need not apply. Script writers take a back seat to the CGI experts. In the case of San Andreas, it provides us something new: not just earthquakes, not just tsunamis, nor the typical well-timed American flag unfurling. What is new? We get The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) saving the world or at least portions of California. For those unaware, there is a huge fault caused by tectonic plates along the West Coast of the United States. These plates have been the cause of actual earthquakes throughout history and provided story line for many films. This fault line takes centre stage and is allowed to wreak havoc through many of California's cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and even, Bakersfield. Even though San Andreas is a multi-regional disaster, the real story is of a man striving to save his family. Ray's (Johnson) family has been torn apart by tragedy and divorce, but beyond the personal dramas he has to save them from these impending earthquakes. It may not be an original storyline, but the reason many will choose to go to the cinema is to experience the ground-breaking special effects that come from this genre, have some fun and may even have a bit of a laugh.  Did San Andreas provide this desired special effects smorgasbord? To a degree, but it was not in the way that was expected. If San Andreas offers anything new to the catastrophic film experience, it is the breathtaking sound engineering. This may seem simplistic, but the sound engineering made this experience all encompassing and primal. Interestingly, it was the sound design that helps by adding a bizarre emotional component to the story. It allows the audience to feel the impact of the earthquakes and action on a new level.  Beyond the sound design, the rest of this familiar tempestuous tale suffered under the weight of expectation. Not that there was a high level of expectation for the script, the acting, but the visual experience, albeit grand, is not original. Some of the biggest visual challenges in the wake of the carnage were unexplained buildings in two world class cities that contained minimal occupants, vehicles with unlimited fuel consumption and the 'needle in a hay stack' search and rescue process. Yet, even with it's failings, director Brad Peyton (Journey 2: The Mysterious Island) provides the unbelievable and makes it all seem probable through the adrenaline-charged action. Also, the inclusion of the family drama cast against the backdrop of a disaster helped provide the film with the needed soul and a reason to care for the characters. The expectations were for this to be silly and unbelievable, but ultimately it turned out to be fun escapism.  Within the escapism, the questions get back to the primal considerations of the human experience: survival, salvation, the end of the world and the bond of family. In a year of disaster and dystopian films, it is easy to consider the end of the world, but San Andreas goes a step further and provides a glimpse into our need for others and especially family. In an unbelievable manner, this story shows the lengths people will go to provide care and safety for their family. This small familial nugget provides the gem amongst the falling rocks of California. Leaving the cinema... Disaster films rank at the bottom of the list of my preferred genres. Why? Each film has to find different and bigger ways to destroy the world and in the end provides the same result. When it comes to San Andreas, it does not break new ground, but even though it was ridiculous, it was fun and provided an enjoyable cinematic escape.  Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the future hold? (The book of Revelation, James 4:13-16) 2. Can we solve our own problems? (Proverbs 3:5, Philippians 4:6) 3. Why do we need a saviour? (Romans 3:10-18, Romans 6:23) Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews #sanandreasIf you're in need for a disaster-movie fix, 'San Andreas' is a Rock-solid bet '2012' marked a pinnacle of sorts for the natural disaster movie sub-genre, containing in a single picture earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis occurring across various cities at the same time. That probably explains why there hasn't been a big-budget studio movie to that effect since then till now, and also why this latest in a while feels the constant need to up the ante. Indeed, 'San Andreas' wears its ambition of being the biggest earthquake movie to date on its sleeve, but unless you haven't gotten your fix of such VFX-enhanced natural catastrophes, you probably will be left nonplussed. For the geographically challenged, the title refers to the nearly 800-mile fault line that runs through California. As seismologist Lawrence Hayes (a very grave-looking Paul Giamatti) intones at the beginning, it has been predicted that a big one will happen every 150 years, and we are already almost 100 years into the current interval. And so, as far as the science goes in this movie, a magnitude-7.1 along a previously unknown fault near the Hoover Dam will trigger a "seismic swarm" along the titular San Andreas fault, precipitating a magnitude-9.1 in Southern California and another even more powerful magnitude-9.6 further up north in San Francisco (for context, the 1960 magnitude-9.5 quake off Chile is the current world record holder).  Amidst the toppling buildings, the human tale that emerges is one of a LAFD helicopter pilot Ray (Dwayne Johnson) who flies into downtown Los Angeles to rescue his ex-wife Emma (Carla Gugino) and then, together with Emma, into the heart of San Francisco to rescue their daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario). Instead of a multi-character narrative, veteran TV writer Carlton Cuse's screenplay focuses pretty much on Ray's solo rescue mission, albeit with some tangential cutaways to see Emma's cowardly boyfriend Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd) get his comeuppance for abandoning Blake earlier on in an underground car park. Fortunately for Emma, a dashing Brit geek named Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) whom she just meets steps up to free her, and with the latter's younger brother Ollie (Art Parkinson), the trio travel together to find higher ground to rendezvous with her parents. It's a clich√©d setup no doubt, and the denouement is to be expected, but Ray's race-against-time to get to his daughter turns out surprisingly affecting. Instead of establishing every little detail upfront, Cuse's script keeps us wondering just what led to Ray's estrangement from his family, which leads to a poignant moment between Ray and Emma at the halfway mark. And instead of reprising another macho action hero role, Dwayne Johnson stays admirably grounded in the role of a father who is driven by equal parts love and grief to make sure that his child is safe. It is probably Johnson's most nuanced performance, and he gets reliable support from Gugino in their third on-screen collaboration to date. Leaving Johnson to do the emotional heavy-lifting, Brad Peyton instead concentrates on choreographing the mayhem around him. No stranger to VFX-heavy setpieces, Peyton tops his previous work in 'Cats and Dogs 2' and 'Journey 2: The Mysterious Island' with some truly jaw-dropping visual spectacle. From the fracturing of the Hoover Dam just ten minutes into the film, Peyton moves on to design the destruction of the entire Los Angeles skyline before moving on to extend the same devastation to the whole San Francisco Bay Area. It is one thing to see skyscrapers like the US Bank Tower and the Citigroup Centre falling and quite another to witness a giant tsunami send a container tanker smack into the Golden Gate Bridge, and let's just say this is probably as real as it gets next to it happening for real. Whether it was intended at the start, the choice to cast Ray as a helicopter pilot turns out to be quite the inspired one. With generous help from his cinematographer Steve Yedlin, Peyton toggles between three different perspectives from which to let his audience appreciate the scale of the disaster. There is Emma's point-of-view from someone on the ground, Ray's point-of-view from in between the toppling buildings as he tries to retrieve Emma from mid-air, and finally an even more birds-eye point-of-view of the whole earth shaking, buckling, broken, on fire, and inundated with water. The combination of these distinct points-of-view should keep audiences looking for spectacle thoroughly engaged, especially those who can't quite care more about the unfolding human drama. And yet, even though it does follow disaster-movie formula to a fault (pun intended), there is no shaking off that feeling of 'been there done that'. Yes, like we said at the start, there isn't much more any filmmaker can do to top the Armageddon wrought by Roland Emmerich in '2012', and to be sure, Peyton doesn't do that. That said, if you're looking for an earnest reminder just how unpredictable and cataclysmic Mother Nature can be, then you'll find no fault with 'San Andreas'. It doesn't get too sappy or too melodramatic, and even contains some useful PSA tips on just what to do if and when you're caught in one. It's a Rock-solid disaster movie, we'll give you that.Mediocrity (with boobs) This is the review San Andreas deserves (and this is a real and honest review, and not just a way to fill up the prerequisite ten lines): Bla bla bla bland bla bla bla bland formulaic bla bla bla predictable bla bla bla unbearably mediocre bla bla bla bland bla bla bla dull bla bla bla clich√© on top of clich√© bla bla bla sentimental bla bla bla sunset bla bla bla American flag bla bla bla totally toe-cringing bla bla bla bland. All seen before bla bla bla what was Carlton Cuse thinking bla bla bla what were any of the actors thinking bla bla bla money talks and bullsh!t walks bla bla bla they'll never live this crap down bla bla bla even the clueless British guy was played by an Aussie 'cos no True Brit would be caught dead in All-American Pie porn like this bla bla bla please don't waste your time unless you're twelve years old and haven't seen a lot of movies bla bla bla. The Rock should be an action hero, but except for one short scene in the beginning and one in the end, he and his muscles have nothing to do in this movie. Bla bla bla worst of all: he's a big-time rescue guy and when the disaster hits no one is asking him to help in the rescue efforts? He just goes after his own daughter and leaves everyone else to die? How convenient for the plot. As a superhero fan, I find any story about a hero who abandons his hero career just so he can selfishly be with his family to be abhorrently anti-heroic. A father is a normal dude, not a hero. A hero puts all the innocents first, because his ability to save them also gives him a moral imperative to actually do it. What's more important: the save the world or to save your family? Good luck with your happy family when the world has gone to hell. Sheesh. The one interesting thing I took away from this movie: Boobs. Carla Gugino = big boobs. Her daughter in the movie, Alexandra Daddario = big boobs. And she takes off more and more clothes as the movie progresses. So, watch this movie for the boobs. It's got nothing else to recommend it. Seriously. If you have any sense of quality at all, this movie will disappoint you. A lot. Average average average bla bla bla and so clich√©-filled that I refuse to honor it with a 5 star review. In this day and age, playing it safe with formulaic storytelling must be exposed as despicable. So subtracting one star for that, ending up at 4 out of 10. Bla bla bla big, dumb movie. Unlike the superior "2012", this is nothing you'd ever want to re-watch.Amazing Disaster Movie Shot in 3D! YOU NEED TO SEE THIS!@#$ I just came out of the theater and needed to write this review!! Mostly because none of the other reviews I read on IMDb, 10 min prior to seeing this movie, did it any justice! In short the motives are very clear: parents looking for their kid in a disaster zone and kid trying to get to parents. That's all you need to know and all that's going to happen, now here comes the part that makes the movie amazing. Somebody thought very long and very hard about how to crack down California in a visually stunning and perfectly shot way. The movie is one of four movies coming out this year shot in full 3D and holy smokes man it looks amazing. The detail in every shot, movement everywhere the depth in these huge structures cracking up. Simply amazing, every single shot benefited from the full 3D experience making the suspense unbearable. The disasters just don't stop till you walk out of the theater pumped with adrenaline. If you want to go for a very nice ride please do yourself a favor and watch the movie. And watch it in 3D! Don't give in to the skeptics, it's just their loss! Also I would like to thank the team that made this movie, thank you for making my sleeper hit of this year. I had more fun watching this in 3D than I had watching Avengers or Mad Max (which I saw both in laser 3D).OK, but nothing new.... First, the special Effects are really cool and the Camera is nice. The biggest Problem is the Story, there is no Story at all. A Father must rescue his Wife and Daughter from the Disaster, that's it.... And it's sad that many Opportunities to make the Disaster much bigger (you feel it on the east coast?? where, i don't see nothing about that! Nuke Reactors? what's about that?) wasn't part of the Movie. But the thrill was OK, except the many stereotype Characters and Moves. I think, San Andreas is a OK Disaster Movie with nice FX. But at the End, it doesen't show you some new Stuff you never saw. 5 from 10 Points, thats fair enough!Just too much all round Too much, too often would about sum it up. I'm glad I went to a free preview screening, I would have be thoroughly annoyed had I paid ¬£15 to watch it. Spoilers below: From the opening scene's it was clear this movie was going to be far fetched. With liberal use of CGI "because we can" not stopping to think whether they should or not. Some bits work fine - the Hoover Dam for instance is a realistic enough scene, but the movie just descends into farce rather quickly. For instance - Kylie Minogue appears randomly for about 30 seconds before she jumps to her death. The action sequences get more and more far fetched and the main characters survive them all with barely a scratch. This lack of realism and sanity just made it all a bit of an ever increasing farce. The use of cheesy comedy lines don't help - it's a movie that you just cannot take seriously, and for me that spoiled my enjoyment of an otherwise well made film.Dunderheaded Disaster The Rock is a curious choice for a leading man. His enormous physique is perfect for the cartoon world of GI Joe, or the Fast and Furious films, and Michael Bay exploited it to grand guignol effect in Pain &amp; Gain, but here it's problematic. The man looks so strong you can't ever buy he's in real danger, and he can't yet convey the emotional range you'd need to be convinced he's emotionally vulnerable either. That, however, is the least of San Andreas's problems.  San Andreas is one in a very long line of PG-rated films dating back to the mid-nineties that engulf American coastal cities with CGI.Thousands die (including a WTF cameo from Kylie Minogue) but you'd never know it, the insensitivity and cowardice of the PG rating meaning the film can happily exploit 9/11 imagery without it really feeling like anyone got hurt. In this day and age, this feels borderline insensitive. More so, the script feels the need to turn it up to 9.6 on the Richter scale of stupidity and then take itself seriously, no better represented here as Paul Giamatti doing his most serious seriousness that it vaults into true camp. Contrivance is heaped on contrivance to contrived effect, and suspension of disbelief is suspended to suspenseless effect.  Occasionally between all the shifting CGI plates, the film quietens down and here it actually becomes moderately engaging, before it asks the cast to gaze at a CGI American flag unfurling against a CGI magic hour and crass reassurances that everything is fine, but it hasn't earned the right to reassure us because it isn't any good.The sound crew do sterling work, and little Art Pilkington from The Impossible show the rest of the cast how to be genuinely charming and funny, the one survivor (okay, Carla Gugino is lovely and warm as always) of this digital disaster foisted on an unexpected audience, the true victims of this tale.This Roller-Coaster Was Relentless! Because watching at the 4DX Theater at the Bonifacio High Street is twice the price of the usual movie, we need to decide well which films will be best seen in such an all-involving manner beyond sight and sound. The first time I decided to watch there was "Into the Storm," a film that recounted the violent effects of a massive tornado in the American Midwest. Today, for my second time to watch there, it is yet another disaster movie, this time about a massive earthquake. I guess in my book, a disaster movie would be one genre of film that would work well in 4DX, and certainly this time I am not wrong. At the risk of betraying my age, I recall in my childhood that there was a famous film entitled "Earthquake" (1974) which was a big deal back then because it was shown in theaters with a special soundtrack effect called "Sensurround." My vague recollections of that movie experience was very loud and heavy bass sound effects made audiences feel like they were shaking along with the action on the screen. Of course, with one disaster film being released after another over the years, audiences would expect the new one to supersede the previous one in terms of special visual effects of mass destructiveness. "San Andreas" definitely does not disappoint in that aspect. Professor Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) and his team at CalTech had perfected a method of predicting earthquakes. Just when they were testing their system at the Hoover Dam, a very strong earthquake strikes. However, their equipment shows that that that Nevada earthquake was just the precursor of a bigger, more destructive as their indicators light up the whole San Andreas fault line from Los Angeles all the way to San Francisco! Meanwhile, we meet Fire and Rescue chief Ray Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) had to rescue his estranged wife Emma (Carla Gugino) trapped somewhere in LA, and then rush off by all (and I mean all -- land, sea and air) means of transportation possible to rescue their daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) trapped somewhere in San Francisco with her two new British friends who helped her, the charming architect Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his perky younger brother Ollie (Art Parkinson). Will Ray reach Blake in time to rescue her, or will he be reliving a past tragedy from which he had never really moved on?  We all know that story is not really the big selling point of a film like this. We can all somehow predict how the family drama would go in the end, don't we? We know that Ray Gaines, being the "Rock" that he is, would be a super-dad who just happened to know how to do EVERYTHING. It was so good that Dwayne Johnson nailed both action and dramatic scenes with aplomb and sincerity. He provides both muscle and heart to this film. We know we will be seeing lucky characters, narrow escapes, coincidental encounters, last-minute saves, and yes, these incredible scenes are there aplenty. Oh, cheesy romantic scenes? It had those too. No, we do not really watch films like this for the story. People who watch this film are there to watch the best special effects used to recreate the most realistic disasters. "San Andreas" spared nothing in its span and scale of disaster. You have seen the Golden Gate Bridge destroyed in other films, but I bet you've never seen it destroyed this way before. Watching this in 3D+4DX is worth the extra ticket price because this really brings us more into the midst of the massive earthquake. Our seats are shaking with the quake, as well as the motors of the cars, planes, copters or boats we see on screen, with the wind blowing around us. It is literally breathtaking as we are taken on a relentless roller- coaster ride, with adrenaline on a constant high.  Odd as it may seem, while this film fully captures the terrifying power and fearsome wrath of a massive widespread earthquake, with our hero Ray and his family to root for, this film is also becomes quite entertaining to watch as well. Director Brad Peyton was able to strike that perfect balance to keep us at the edge of our seats with the sense of imminent (and potentially real) danger, and still have an exhilarating fun time. You may also pick up some quake survival tips along the way. 7/10. With the 3D+4DX, 8/10.Not a complete disaster. As far as disaster movies go, this does very little to shake up the genre. Some characters have little if any development over the course of the 115 minute runtime and some are flat out 2-dimensional. The inclusion of two English boys who were likely told to do their best Hugh Grant impression for the the entirety of the runtime contributed to a ridiculous tone which weighed this movie down. The stunt-men deserve the highest accolades for what worked in this movie. The action scenes are vastly enjoyable on the big screen with the pulsating action making you almost feel like your cinema is actually shaking. All action aside, where the movie truly fails is in that Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is given little chance to use his world famous charisma. The film tries to find comic relief through secondary characters played by unknowns, completely ignoring the top-billed actor being forced to play the emotional core of the movie to struggling effect. In a film littered with inaccuracies in physics and nearly every disaster movie clich√© under the sun, it make no sense why most of the time The Rock is not being allowed to showcase what ultimately is behind his popularity. Despite this film's flaws in terms of dialogue, characters and an earth-shifting tone - I stand by my 6 out of 10 rating. The action scenes are spaced out well and each is extremely immersing despite being able to predict the outcome is almost inevitable. If you do see this film, try to seek out the biggest screen possible to be able to fully enjoy the action spectacles as they are the most redeeming factors working for this film. The side plots are nothing new to the genre with an underused Paul Giamatti playing the film's disaster expert, trying to work alongside a news crew to let people know that they need to leave the San Francisco as soon as possible, as if their life depended on it. At it's conclusion this side plot seemed near insignificant and could have been taken out to shorten the runtime and allow for a lesser dilution of the action. In summary, the action sequences are very entertaining on the big screen but the film is weighed down by a detrimental and disappointing script and the feeling the director was crossing off a checklist for every disaster movie clich√© imaginable.Oh the Rock...Can you do any wrong? What an awesome and fun ride through the "what if" scenarios of some very real themed situations.  Once again, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson can seemingly do no wrong (except for his corny role in Fast &amp; Furious). The entire movie centers on his character and his shattered family after the loss of their child. As the story unfolds the layers to his character and introduces you to his job and expertise you feel the set up for what becomes a pretty believable character.  As the audience embarks on this journey of tectonic plates and fault lines, the "what if" plays heavy on the connection to the film. I am still certain and have been long before this movie, California is one good earthquake from being an island so this movie worked for me! You get some necessary background information about what's going on whether you can truly understand most of it or not, you can see it's serious none the less. Out of no where the movie goes from going great to the start of the never ending series of coincidences and weird behavior that had to have been added just to make the story flow.  *Spoiler Starts* Paul Giamatti plays Dr. Lawrence or Prof Lawrence at the school that is doing the research along with his partner Will Yun Lee as Dr. Park. They are the ones who have created the ability to predict earthquakes and the movie starts to dig in. While at the Hoover Dam, they realize they indeed can predict them but its a little too late for Dr. Park...in a terrible scripted event, he dies while saving a little girl who he throws across the falling bridge. It became very clich√© and eye rolling worthy. Was it needed for him to die? Maybe but so lame, no! That I guess is what pushed Paul's character to dig deep to make their work stand for something.  The movie from this point is a great ride but filled with a bunch of too close for comfort events that somehow still don't kill any of the important main characters. As buildings are falling, the ground is cracking, the sea is swelling and fires run amok, the mains just keep on pushing. Now The Rock is king of all things bad ass but dude, damn, you are one resume stacked veteran. In the movie he's LA Fire and Rescue and prior military Let me see if I can list all the things he is certified to do in bad ass fashion.  -Helicopter Pilot -Rescue Jumper -Cessna Pilot -Certified Skydiver with tethering experience (somehow this one still got me because they didn't know they weren't going to be able to land the plane when they took it so I am sure he didn't check any gear that may or may not have already been in the plane. It was taken from a jump school but still, do you trust a randomly packed parachute that just was laying around? Ummmmm I don't, but for Hollywood, go ahead I suppose. -Expert Speed Boat operator along with his wife. (Cargo Ships are behind the swell and still don't make it but his speed boat does...I want that edition) -Expert diver because he can hold his breath forever. -Biggest yet most gentle CPR certified person in the world. (a normal person doing correct CPR cracks ribs on the individual they are trying to save and he does it on his little, cute, and large chested daughter Alexandra Daddario aka Blake for what seems forever. She wakes up eventually after a dramatic end to an almost telling story of two daughters killed by drowning tale. She's fine, no pain, walking and talking at the end like nothing ever happened. Now that could have been a good moment for a joke about her being all broken inside but hey, I am not the writer. -Expert survival teacher ( Blake and her friends only survived this movie because of the things her dad so called taught her. Oh and the fact her moms crappy boyfriend did one thing right, he built a strong skyline.) I think I have covered his roles in the film but I am sure I am missing something. Don't get me wrong, I still really enjoyed the film and it's awesome 3D graphics but if I didn't find any fault, it just wouldn't be right. I would watch this again over many of the films I a have seen this year. Great for the family, those who enjoy a thrill, and sci-fi enthusiasts. Overall good job Brad Peyton and I give your move a 7 and a smile.  CouryBest disaster movie in 19 years Los Angeles, San Francisco and even Hoover Dam in Nevada is getting wasted by series of huge earthquakes, which are caused by the San Andreas fault zone ‚Äì thank god, we have Dwayne Johnson! San Andreas is that kind of "blow your brains out and hold on!" -destruction porn, what I have waited for 19 years, since Independence Day. It is really f**n entertaining and I love'd every second of the ride. Also the 3D is created well ‚Äì even though stereoscopic effect is generated afterwards in digital post-production. There are dozens of stupid and illogical takes and sequences that makes you face palm yourself, but the fact is, that San Andreas is just awesome disaster movie.It's all quite exciting until human interactions again replace the alarming CG obliteration of skyscrapers. "San Andreas" unfolds exactly like a Roland Emmerich disaster movie, which means the screen is awash with computer-enhanced destruction of epic proportions, while predictable familial drama ‚Äì laced with dialogue that no real person would ever utter ‚Äì plays out in the background. The effects are impressive and the massive annihilation of property is thrilling enough, assuming that viewers can accommodate a modicum of sympathy for the paper-thin characters that fill clich√©s surprisingly not omitted from modern adventure films. "San Andreas" delivers exactly what its trailers promise, but little else, though a few brief moments hint at potential emotional impact - regularly sidelined for increasingly catastrophic sequences of natural disaster calamity. Los Angeles Fire and Rescue helicopter pilot Ray Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) hopes to spend some quality time with his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) before she heads off to college - but a seismic episode in Nevada forces him to abruptly return to work. When an intense earthquake hits Southern California, Ray rescues his estranged wife Emma (Carla Gugino) before determining to travel north across the state to save their daughter. Meanwhile, Caltech seismologist Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) partners with news reporter Serena (Archie Panjabi) to warn as many people as possible of another inevitable quake of even larger magnitude that will hit San Francisco. The visuals are sensational, but the human drama is comical. Instead of grasping believable forms of chaos and hysteria from frantic survivors, like the oftentimes depressingly dark immoralities witnessed in zombie movies, "San Andreas" opts for opportune romance between grateful youths, comedy relief during split-second decision making, and tearful confessions about guilt-ridden pasts. There's even a highly exaggerated villain, concocted in an instant to wrench further anxiety from already strained relationships. And the dialogue is regularly laughable as monumental or heartrending speeches are unconvincingly delivered. Just because Paul Giamatti plays the leading expert (studying a revolutionary earthquake prediction system like something out of "Twister"), it doesn't mean the message can be taken seriously. The script also strangely juggles its oversized cast, captained by the "American Sniper" of rescuers, who opens the film with a daring helicopter mission to save a girl inside a car that dangles from the side of a crevasse. It's a bit like the opening scene from "Cliffhanger," except that it's nearly devoid of suspense. Although there is plenty of random devastation, the camera focuses on numerous parties, most of which have fleeting resonance on the basic story of a family's tribulations. A reporter and her cameraman, a team of scientists, a hacker, LAFD members, architects, relatives, job applicants, a waitress, and more all seem to snag screen time away from characters that actually have a part to play. Then there's the destruction itself. When dull or pointless roles aren't interrupting the breathtaking environmental carnage, the screen is filled with staggering imagery of large-scale decimation. It's all quite exciting until human interactions again replace the alarming CG obliteration of skyscrapers, streets, and cargo ships alike. The first-rate razing of San Francisco is almost enough to forget about the ludicrous coincidences that allow the core group of survivors to continually reunite (and simply stay alive) against a backdrop of millions of people dying and thousands of buildings collapsing.  The Massie Twins Watchable, ridiculous, all-American histrionics I'm feeling generous -- I'm going to give San Andreas a 4 out of 10. That's on account of some impressive special effects work, and the fact that as terrible as the script is, it doesn't devolve into the kind of non-stop chaos that too many current big summer movies resort to. The film is at least watchable in some basic sense. Now, to the story: I described the plot of this movie -- before seeing it -- to a friend and I'd say I got 80% of the details correct. That's how formulaic and predictable these kind of movies have become: the family patriarch will rescue his beautiful family while the world burns around them; we end with their triumphant reunion, somehow along the way forgetting that, you know, millions of people have died so the good fortune of one upper middle class American family isn't really all that potent of a tonic for what we've witnessed. At its heart, a movie like San Andreas is a kind of ideological propaganda: the supremacy of the all-American nuclear family over any chaos the world can throw at it. This film mixes in a strong dose of patriotism (from Dwayne Johnson's heroic status as an Afghan War veteran, to the unfurling of the American flag from the broken Golden Gate bridge at the end) to supplement this family-over-all message. However, the problem here is that Johnson's Ray Gaines actions are not patriotic. Far from it, they are a grave dereliction of duty. As a Los Angeles Fire Department rescue helicopter pilot, his job is to serve the greater good. Instead he selfishly rescues his estranged wife from the tony penthouse restaurant where she was having lunch, and then, even worse, the two of them head to San Francisco (in an LAFD helicopter!) to save their daughter.  It should go without saying that a Los Angeles fireman's first job is to assist Los Angelenos in the aftermath of a 9.1 Southern California earthquake, not to steal one of our taxpayer-bought helicopters and fly it to San Francisco. (I would have loved to have been in the writers' room when they hammered this plot point out.) Indeed, the essence of "patriotism" should be that Ray trusts San Francisco firefighters to stay on duty and do their job, while he does the same in Los Angeles. If every firefighter in California behaved like Ray Gaines, no one would be rescued because all the firetrucks and helicopters would have been racing across the state to various colleges to rescue (exceptionally well-endowed) daughters. I'd like to see a movie about the thousands of people who died in East Los Angeles while Ray was flying north up the Central Valley for several hours. It's funny -- on the way into San Andreas I heard the guy in front of me say, about Mad Max: Fury Road, "I wasn't too impressed... it was more of a political, women's empowerment kind of thing." How many people come out of San Andreas and recognize that it is even more political than the Mad Max film? The difference is that this is a propaganda film for all-American values (patriarchy, family, physical work -- i.e. the latter is contrasted with the step-father, a designer or architect, who is shown to be morally repugnant), while Mad Max has a message that subverts and provokes those assumed values. I dunno -- I'm not very political but it seems pretty funny to me that only the subversive film is recognized as being ideological. Think about it. Great special effects, though!San Andreas aka 2012 aka Day After Tomorrow ****I will indicate when I will begin spoiler talk so you can get my general feelings on the movie if you do not want critical plot points spoiled for you**** Have you seen the movies 2012, The Day after Tomorrow, Independence Day, Into the Storm, or any other disaster film? Well, if you have, you have also seen San Andreas, one of the most clich√©d movies I have ever seen in my entire life. You already know how this entire movie is going to play out. It will start with some minor destruction, continue into a lecture being given by a teacher so that the writers do not have to think of creative ways to tell us information and instead spoon feed us vital background, the main character will be conveniently located at the center of the action, and then for the last act just reference any action movie ever made to see how the climax and falling action takes place. While everything is extremely predictable, I must admit that in terms of this movie just being a fun visual feast (although that is not at all what the tone conveys), I can say that most of the action and destruction scenes were pretty well done and actually extremely intense at some parts. However, when these scenes are not taking place, cue the useless, generic, predictable character development delivered by actors who are mainly there just for the pay check. Something else to mention is how incredibly stupid the characters are. A character was driving down a straight stretch of road for about a mile with a couple of miles of visibility, then all of a sudden they are shocked to see a massive (I'm talking the size of a foot ball field) crack going through the road stretching for miles. UHM, hello?!?! Don't you think he probably would have seen that, idk like a mile back?! It is stupid decisions such as these that really make me mad at the characters and do not make me feel bad when they face peril. I am talking about a lot of negative aspects of the movie, but I did have a decent time with it and I did actually get pretty frightened in some of the action scenes. But this does not make up for the overwhelming negative aspects also including way too many conveniences happening for the main characters that have to happen or else they would die and we would not have a movie. Overall, I would say you should check this movie out in theaters, but as long as you know not to expect too much, and as long as you do not have anything else better to do. And i mean that, NOTHING else better to do! Grade: 74/C. *********OKAY! Spoiler talk begins here!!!!!!***** For my spoiler talk for this movie, I figured that I would share with you a drinking game that I created in my head while watching this movie. The way you play is take a shot anytime you correctly guess the outcome of a plot point in the movie, or correctly identify something that is blatantly suggested to be a future reincorporation. I guess this isn't really spoiler talk because if you have seen any disaster/action movie ever you will be able to stay ten steps ahead of this movie at all times, never actually being surprised by "twists") I will share with you when (if I was playing) I had to take a shot: 1. Girl's mom's boyfriend emphasizes the strength of the building he is building; she later goes to try to survive the tsunami, shocker. 2. Ray discusses how one of his daughters died by drowning; what a surprise his second daughter had to be saved from drowning. 3. Ray saves his daughter and is giving her CPR; cue the clich√© moment of silence then water flows out of her mouth JUST when we were scared and thought that she was actually going to die! 4. As***le boyfriend ditches main character's daughter (and serves as the rich, selfish d!ck also seen in 2012), and what a surprise he gets a comical death later on in the movie. 5. Car is trying to escape the collapsing parking garage, girl gets trapped, and what do you know the person to save her is the sweet guy she just met and shared very quirky dialog with. 6. Sweet guy saves girl by lifting cement block with a tire lift, who saw that coming! 7. Two main characters getting a divorce, but what a surprise they decide to stay together in the end. 8. In the end, characters hug and cry in happiness that they are safe and reunited, then the camera panned out to show the destruction one more time. What an original ending, am I right!! (I hope people are able to understand my sarcasm and not actually take this last part seriously, If you thought I was serious, you are the type of person who might actually like this movie.)Thrilling, good graphics, clean story, enjoyable show Another good movie from the Rock. Its a gripping tale involving the San Andreas earthquake, with good graphics and an engaging storyline from start to finish.  Hardly predictable IMO, the movie itself is well thought out and well made, the CGI is pretty good and realistic (people shrieked out in excitement from various parts of the theater at various times!), and Dwayne Johnson brings an exciting vibe to the whole show. Overall, it makes for an enjoyable evening out. A must watch at the theaters this Summer! The film fully captures the terrifying power and fearsome wrath of a massive widespread earthquake. It also becomes quite entertaining to watch with the family getting their act together to survive the effects of the quake. Director Brad Peyton was able to strike that perfect balance to keep us at the edge of our seats with the sense of imminent (and potentially real) danger, and still have an exhilarating fun time. The music is also quite catchy and entertaining. And yes, you'll also pick up some quake survival tips along the way!OK disaster movie that was clich√© at times I have seen some other reviews on here that 'get it'. Disaster movies are never re-known for brilliant acting or character development. It was no different with San Andreas. What carried the movie, like 2012 was the amazing CGI and of course if you are a fan of disaster movies, it provided a great deal of destruction and action. There were indeed emotional parts and likable characters especially Ben and Ollie.However,I do feel Dwayne Johnson was far too one dimensional and boring. Another funny thing that acted as quite the distraction was the perfect selection of big breasted women Alexandra Daddario and Carla Gugino. This was there one redeeming quality and like Dwayne, they were one dimensional and forgettable. Overall, I would recommended this movie to disaster movie fans, its along the lines of 2012, knowing..etc . If you are expecting academy award winning, Hans zimmer,/Christopher Nolan type of movie, then simply do no waste your time watching it .Destruction Prostitution First thing first, I rated it 6 for all special effects and the destruction p*rn which I am a big fan of! Ignoring how scientifically accurate the story-line was, I was very entertained throughout the movie! Special effects were great and did take the movie to a whole new level of awesomeness. Now what really annoyed me during the movie is the inability of the Rock to act and they keep on hiring him for more movie roles. His face never changes when he's happy, sad, angry, joyful ... The rest of the cast was OK, Ollie character is just boring and the movie can do without. These are some points really annoyed me during watching it: Ollie character who supposedly is 13 years old, acts like he's sexually frustrated all the time, I mean common he's a child. The plot of the movie was very obvious and clich√©; I saw that boring ending coming a mile away but as I said, I love its special effects and that's why I really wasn't affected by all negatives, I was able to get over them and enjoy the CGI non human part of the movie.Expected Reading other reviews of this movie left me wondering if the reviewers went into the wrong cinema. If you know ANYTHING about movies you should know that disaster movies are just a few hours escapism.Yes, plot holes all over the place and so very predictable but this was just like a roller-coaster ride.You KNEW there was no real danger or threat but you get what you expect from disaster movie. Dwayne thingy cannot act to save his life..but like the recent Mad Max, this was pure escapism. Well filmed and shot..saw it in 3D but that had no bearing on the experience.Saw it with my 12 yr old daughter and we both enjoyed. not going to win any Oscars but if you go to the theatre expecting something else then you will be disappointed.Gave it a 5 as the CGI team worked overtime!The Story is Stupid but the Entertainment is High San Andreas (2015)  *** (out of 4)  After a massive earthquake strikes California, a father (Dwayne Johnson) must struggle to try and rescue his estranged wife (Carla Gugino) and his daughter (Alexandra Daddario) who finds herself somewhere in San Fransisco. While people are trying to dig themselves out of the damage, a seismologist (Paul Giamatti) warns people that the big one hasn't yet happened. SAN ANDREAS is without question one of the dumbest movies that you're going to see in the year 2015 or perhaps any other year. I mean, things happen here that are without question quite stupid and that includes a really dumb love story and the logic of some of the scenes are downright laughable. With that said, one really shouldn't go into this movie expecting anything other than a popcorn movie meant to keep you entertained and this film certainly does that as it's a pretty good throwback to the Irwin Allen disaster pictures like EARTHQUAKE, THE TOWERING INFERNO and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE. I really can't believe I'm saying this but the special effects are certainly the highlight of the picture. I'm usually not a fan of CGI because more times than not it just looks fake and takes away from the story but we're reaching a point in technology where it's really hard to see the effect, which is just great. There's a massive amount of destruction throughout this film and I must admit that the effects make you feel that everything you're watching is real. This includes the actual earthquake footage as well as all the destruction around the state. There are countless buildings that fall and the aftermath of the quake looks extremely realistic. The story itself is quite stupid as we get all sorts of predictable scenes but I can't really blame the film for this as the entire disaster genre had silly melodrama going on. The relationship issues between Johnson and Gugino are quite stupid and of course there's a side story dealing with him not being able to save a daughter that died. The screenplay pretty much throws everything into the mix and just hopes any of it sticks. Again, it's hard to bash the "dumb" story too much since the film is so entertaining but I will give the film credit for delivering the highest body count in the history of cinema. Again, going into SAN ANDREAS expecting anything other than entertainment probably isn't the best idea. The actors are all entertaining in their own right and that's especially true for Daddario. As far as Johnson goes, he's certainly not the greatest actor in the world but he makes for a great action star.Not the greatest, but I enjoyed it nonetheless My love of the disaster genre means that I can enjoy this type of movie despite the myriad problems with it, alongside the inherent cheesiness and the poor writing which makes it laughable in places. It pales in comparison to stuff from the 1970s like THE TOWERING INFERNO and EARTHQUAKE, but it's certainly better than modern SyFy Channel and Asylum offerings, even if that's just because of the massive budget alone. The story is written so that the disaster scenes keep occurring throughout the movie. The CGI effects work is extensive, but it's also pretty good, and certainly better than in the awful 2012. Yes, you get all the flag-waving nonsense associated with this type of film, but you also get plenty of suspense scenes and depictions of post-earthquake devastation that you don't usually get to see in the movies. Dwayne Johnson continues to be a hulking, mildly charismatic presence in the movies, although he's no Schwarzenegger. Alexandra Daddario is there for her looks and certainly succeeds in that respect. The rest of the cast don't fare so well, with Ioan Gruffudd virtually reprising his role from SANCTUM and Paul Giamatti on autopilot, although at least we get to find out what happened to Art Parkinson (the disappearing Rickon Stark from TV's GAME OF THRONES). SAN ANDREAS is certainly undemanding entertainment, and not a film I'm in any hurry to sit through again, but compared to other offerings in this packed sub-genre, it's not THAT bad.lots of destruction Raymond Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) is an LAFD rescue helicopter pilot. He is getting divorced to his wife Emma (Carla Gugino) after the death of their daughter Mallory. They still have their daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario). Emma is moving in with her rich boyfriend Daniel Riddick (Ioan Gruffudd). Daniel is flying with Blake on a private plane to San Francisco as he opens his new highrise. Meanwhile, Caltech professor Dr. Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) is researching an earthquake predictor with reporter Serena Johnson (Archie Panjabi) doing a story on him. When the earthquake strikes, Blake is trapped as Daniel abandons her. Brothers Ben and Ollie Taylor come to the rescue. It's funny that I saw Charlton Heston's Earthquake (1974) just before watching this movie. CGI has created much better destruction. Neither has a terribly good story. It's weird that the seismic teams from both movies go to a dam. The Rock is great as always. His opening rescue is fun and exciting. It does bother me that he's a rescue pilot but he doesn't rescue a soul flying all over California. I love the destruction and the action but lots of bothersome things start piling up. It's weird that Raymond would tell Emma to bring as many people as possible to go up to the roof. He's only one helicopter and I doubt he could take more than ten people. They would be in terrible trouble if she's actually successful. Next, it bothered me that Ben brought Ollie down to the basement garage. I get the risk reward equation of rescuing the hot girl but he can't bring his little brother into that. Finally, Raymond and Emma is racing through the flooded streets like the Grand Prix. I cringed at thought of all those people they're running over as they speed through. You can forget about them stopping to help anybody else. That's the last straw for me. I can live with all the death and destruction but the heroes can't be running over everybody with their boat. There are a few overwrought scenes and I would like a connection between Dr. Hayes and the Gaines.Enjoyable enough nonsense which benefits from big effects and a big presence in the lead It has been quite a few years since I made much of an effort when it came to summer blockbusters; yes their main selling point is spectacle so in theory you want the biggest sound system and screen you can get, but personally I'll take a smaller version of those in return for not paying a fortune for a ticket, and not having to deal with the cinema going public. And so it was that I watched San Andreas while catching up with several weeks worth of laundry ‚Äì just like I imagine the director envisaged. The plot is of course very simple ‚Äì lots of buildings get destroyed by an earthquake, people die in horrific but yet sanitized ways, and ultimately it will all (somehow) be okay in the end. Providing a human focus for all of this is helicopter pilot Ray who spends the film trying to rescue his family. Ignoring the moral ambiguity of him clearing off on a personal mission with his skills (and helicopter) at a time when he could have helped many more than the few members of his immediate family, this provides a reasonable frame for the film to keep us vaguely caring. And it is vague because when the film stops moving for even a minute, you really do tend to feel it. Luckily it doesn't do this much, and instead we get lots of effects, noise, and general destruction. The money is on the screen and, although it does get tiresome before the end, it at least is distracting. The cast are mostly pretty poor as they are thrown around sets. Johnson is, as ever, a strong presence ‚Äì he is of course a big man first and foremost, but he does have great leading man chops and he is engaging and charismatic throughout. Gugino runs and yells alongside him, while Daddario does her main job of being very attractive and in peril. Gruffold is obviously smarmy, while Johnstone-Hurt and Parkinson are odd additions and their awkward British characters never seem to fit. In the end it is noisy nonsense and it filled two hours of domestic chores, giving me just enough to distract me but never risking me being engaged to the point that I might be too engrossed to finish the work. Watched as such it was okay, but I doubt it would hold up to being the only thing you were doing while watching.The worst movie ever made May be you say "worst movie ever" is too much, there's so many movies that should be one worst. I think there's not. This is by far the worst movie i ever seen and cant believe how some people rate it 10. Completely obvious and predictable, everything that happens you already know it. The "hero" is like superman but in something that should appear real. He can do everything in the best way. He is so great that is funny, even if they are not trying to be. Even the earthquake simulation is completely unreal and fantastic. The 3d is bad, almost unnoticiable. Actings are lame, i cant believe how some known actors can accept the part if they previously read the plot. Don't loose your time even if you download it for free. ANYTHING WORTH YOUR TIME MORE THAN THISmassacre Love the Rock and his cougar wife in this movie is outstanding as well ( she was great in entourage ) HOWEVER The movie special effects are OK .... the story is lame at best 3 out of 10 is perhaps a bit low. The opening scene was OK but once again how on earth does she live from that ..... and that is one amazing helicopter as well. Then lets talk about the daughter .... she is for sure a potential star and actually one of the better actors in this movie. If you have other options I would suggest thatCome On??? First off this movie was beyond ridiculous. It followed such an obvious formula that every moment was predictable. The action scenes were not only far fetched they were impossible. It's not worth more of my time to detail everything that was wrong with this blockbuster waste of CGI money. Let's just say that after a short time I wanted California to crack off into the ocean and kill All of these characters! And thanks to the vast number of "10" ratings I am now 100% convinced most reviews are paid advertisements to boost the overall rating of this film. I'm not sure how you can stop this, but it just really sucks that you can't get honest feedback on websites anymore. Screw you movie companies for paying people to lie about your crap!Amazing! One word, Amazing!!! After all the advertising and gossip,this is exactly what I expected. San Andreas is an action packed film which keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through.You honestly don't know whats going to happen next. The film has an hidden meaning which makes the whole experience more realistic and understanding. OK maybe some scenes where a bit unrealistic and un-life-like, But the whole story behind made it feel acceptable. Recommend to everyone and very surprised that this film hasn't got a better rating.Love the movie Saw this for the first time last month and absolutely loved it. But one glaring problem...or rather inside joke. It seems in almost every disaster movie I've seen that the parents are either divorced or in the process of divorce at the beginning. But along the line of the entire movie the boyfriend of the mom gets killed in some way. And then in the end they get back together. But despite this recurring issue I still like the movie. And another thing about this movie. I love Ioan Gruffudd in his other works including Amazing Grace. But in this...oh my god! I hated his character and actually laughed at his death. But out of everything I love this movie and would definitely recommend this to family and friends.A 3D Disaster Movie And So Much More You think of movies like 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow when you look at the title of this movie. If you are a thrill-seeker for disaster flicks, this movie is definitely one you should watch. Spectacular special effects and CGI, and there is some actual ACTING in this film. The lead characters had emotion, and there was always time in the movie for you to get to really know the characters in the movie. The plot was everything you'd expect from a core disaster movie. You will not be disappointed with Dwayne Johnson's performance. He actually made me cry as I watched the movie (I will not mention spoilers). It's a movie of excitement, heavy doses of intensity, and powerful visuals. It is definitely a must-see!Breathtakingly amazing! Wow! Just Wow! I wouldn't just recommend this film to my young brother, i would also recommend it to my Nan. The film is almost 2 hours long, but it felt like i was only sat down for half an hour. From the first minute you are gripped! As usual, Dwayne Johnson smashed it! what a guy! its jumpy, its funny, and its so beautiful to watch! Some absolute breathtaking scenes! I almost cried at one moment. Anyone who has rated this less than 9 obviously hates life. I would also recommend watching it in 3D. As if it wasn't beautiful enough! Comparing it to other films, i would say it was the best film i have ever seen at the cinema! And i do feel that you need to watch this at the cinema to get the full experience it truly deserves. A straight 10 out of 10! If you had any sense about you, you will watch this!Simply fun and very well acted. My name is Barry Ratcliffe, I judge a movie different than most. I have been a full time actor for 17 years, so I am usually way to critical, so I will make no exception for this film. It is great! That's it, no pompous description of plot lines, archs, or blah, blah! Dwayne does an amazing job acting in this film, that's right, Dwayne Johnson does an AMAZING job action. I don't know why this surprises people. Al Snow is my best friend and he is an excellent actor. Being around the wrestling industry, I am amazed that people don't realize that most of these wrestlers are very smart and have been doing live theater for 20 years plus, that translates very well to acting. And this film had me on the edge of my seat and that never happens with me, I am usually noticing the 400 people in the room putting the film together. But because this movie used great actors, a great story, great effects, audio, and editing, it is simply seamless, and simply a FUN movie!!!!Worth Watching on the big screen Hi, This film was very well put together. The Rock showed a more decent side to his acting skills and whilst the plot is a straightforward disaster and rescue, it was a brilliant edge of the seat film. Worth watching at the cinema for the effects. Don't bother with 3D, though. It's just as good in 2D.The film is around 2 hours long and my two boys and I were gripped through the whole film.  The helicopter scene at the start was well done. The graphics were all excellent and the story was decent enough. We would all look out for our family in the case of a disaster and this is what they show in the film of the Rock rescuing his family. Brilliant film and thoroughly enjoyable. Cheers. JabbarSimply Awful Worst movie of the year so far.... A idiotic collection of clich√©s and propaganda. In which no character seems human. Dwayne Johnson, you can do better. Man, this kind of movie is killing cinema. Seems more as a parody. Birdman warned you about it. Best thing about it is Alexandra Daddario. What a woman! I understand that someone can i fact enjoy this movie seriously, but, i couldn't resist but make jokes about it and how painful it was....Oh yeah this film IS a Disaster ........... Movie Review: (the best I can do) . San Andreas - Highly Fictional ... no Delusional, redux of so many awful mega California Quake films with Cheezy Absurd over the top special effects and horrible acting by "Down the" Dwayne Johnson who couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag, laughable line deliveries by Paul Giamatti and Carla Gugino who used to be good actors. This is supposed to be a Mega Disaster Epic, and that it is ... an Epic Mega Disaster of a laugh. Apparently the writers never consulted a single Scientist in the improbable script for this dumb movie. You would be better served taking your $25 for two tickets and buying Lotto Tickets, which have a better chance of actually happening as advertised. They should have billed this laugh fest as a comedy. 1/2 a Popcorn cold for this Mega Dud of a Apocalyptic Film. And that is the View from the Balcony - KB (c) (tm) 2015Very bad. This is one of the worst movies of 2015. It's a dumb disaster movie. If you are in for a movie that depends only on special effects, it's this one. One of Alfred Hitchcocks sayings, "If the sound cuts out while people are watching a movie, they should still have a perfect idea of what is going on." This movie broke that rule. If this movie had bad effects, it would look terrible. It's the effects that made some people give it a positive review. It's a bad movie, lets all be honest. It's effects are the only reason it has 6.2/10. Other movies like Transformers: Dark Of The Moon (2011) are better because they have better plots. This is just garbage. Now you see the real reason I don't like this movie is because it depended too much on special effects.I'll try to keep it short, but God this movie was awful... Buildings fall over, people scurry left to right, blah,blah,blah, end of movie. The rock is just a piece of meat with no talent as usual. The romance in this movie is comical and contrived at best. The plot is... buildings falling. What else is there to say? That little British kid was annoying. Yup, that's about it for San Andreas The only redeeming factor this movie had was that if this were to happen, ~50% of all the communists in the USA would be swimming with the fishes, other than that, this movie sucked, hard. If you like special effects, this movie may be redeemed by the fact that the special effects were quite good, but that's one of the few saving graces. This will happen in California one day as well, just a matter of time!Irwin Allen where are you? The B movie schlock that Hollywood used top turn out as horror movies. High dollar CGI, low budget story! I'm a movie aholic and see one practically every week. I rarely REALLY regret my choice, this was the exception. I is sssssoooo bad it is rather comical. Suspension of Disbelief is NOT ENOUGH to "explain" MAY parts of this movie. From the opening scene rescue where the helicopter hovers ever so delicately between the trench wall, even when a 4,000# car falls into the abyss whilst attached to a cable on the copter's winch to the GAWD AWFUL scenes where they are in a RID boat tooling through the streets of a VERY DESTROYED San Fran with TONS of debris floating in the water and yet, the outboard prop remains in tact, to the BREATHTAKINGLY HORRIBLE submerged scenes in the same TOTALLY DESTROYED San Fran with CRYSTAL CLEAR water! These UNBELIEVABLE scenes are only exemplar of the ENTIRETY of PURE poo! I REALLY CAN'T believe I sat through the ENTIRE horrible movie!It falls on its own. I can't fault the acting, since the rest of the movie was bad enough for me to not even notice. **SPOILER** The main group of characters should have died many times over- and I would have been kind of glad- because they made terrible survival choices throughout. I know, dramatic effect has to be achieved, but in this movie it was achieved at the expense of my empathy. I'll skip over how many laws of physics and math were broken, since that's a decomposing horse in Hollywood these days. The worst part? At the end, Dwayne's character stands across the bay surveying the destruction, while an American flag unfurls from the remains of the bridge. "Now we rebuild", he says, with his family in his arms. Yeah... he's SEARCH AND RESCUE! Why is he not thinking about now rescuing any of the thousands of trapped and injured people before more die, and especially before thinking about rebuilding?! What?! Now we rebuild? Aren't you skipping a step?  One thing they left out: he didn't travel by train. We had plane, helicopter, boat, parachute, and truck. They missed train. Maybe that will be in the director's cut.San Andreas Has Its Faults There seems to be only five characters in this movie: Dad (Dwayne Johnson), who conveniently has a helicopter, Mom in L.A., Daughter in San Fran, Daughter's puppy-love new boyfriend, Boyfriend's dopey kid brother. Mom and Dad have split up and Mom has a jerky new boyfriend (who is quickly dispatched with when something big falls on him). Dad rescues Mom from a teetering skyscraper after the Big One hits, then they head off to find the Daughter. Mom comes to realize what a Real Man Dad is. This sitcom excuse for a real film is disaster-movie overkill. Right off the bat the Hoover Dam gets wrecked and soon after L.A. is wiped off the map, but not so much San Fran, the better to save it for the grand finale. But wait - don't breathe yet - there's a really big tsunami heading in. Meanwhile, back in the lab, a bunch of scientists scurry around and stare at computers and go: "Uh oh!" Daughter, Boyfriend and Dopey Kid Brother take a stroll up a ruined San Fran street like they're in Disneyland, not the least bit traumatized by what has taken place. Here's the thing: With skyscrapers toppling and destruction on an apocalyptic scale - where are the people? Where's the terror, the pathos, the human tragedy, the acts of desperation and heroism? There are none. And where's the carnage? None of that, either. Yeah, there are a few clusters of extras running around hither and yonder, none the worse for wear. That's because the disaster is merely a back-drop for a banal, insipid, sanitized Disney-esque soap opera about family values and puppy love. And even the disaster scenes themselves become humdrum. The only reason to see this movie is Dwayne Johnson, who somehow manages to carry the movie on his broad shoulders and acts as if he takes the whole thing seriously. You want a great disaster movie (complete with family values, fully realized characters and meaningful drama)? See "The Impossible".This is the typical action movie for you... The title says it all. This is the typical "stupid" action movie for you. All the stereotypes were served on a delicious looking faux-gastronomic like dish, and, to believe that I was going to see something of note. So, far from being the case. First, the video game boats, helicopters and airplane. It is quite amazing how Alexandra Daddario's father avoided falling stones, disastrous life threatening situations with the most perfect God given skills and talent time and time again. I could not believe in many of the scenes how incredible this helicopter guy was at manipulating his engines in between falling buildings and how he was able to climb a tsunami at 90¬∞ avoiding yet again what seem to be the end. That scene had to be one of the most ridiculous and stupid one I've ever seen in an action movie. So inconceivable and unrealistic that they could not even have found a logical end to it since it skips directly to the sequence where they're looking for their daughter. How thy were able to navigate with such ease with their boat in the crumbs of what seemed to be the biggest disaster the south part of America had ever known. In that respect they could have done much better than that. How was the Alexandra Daddario able to make Art Parkinson's laser pointer functional when they were in water ? All these are just a variety of nonsensical scenes that the movie delivered time after time. Second, the whole scene about Alexandra Daddario's situation relative to death was just completely overblown and forced like as if they were trying to draw emotions from the spectator. This lasted for a good couple of time in the movie and turned out to be particularly annoying. The facts that main protagonist always found a way to escape the most life threatening situations made the movie even more annoying in regards to what was being thrown at them. The fact that the earthquake only appeared in specific situations was actually quite disturbing. And, it was easy to anticipate the difficulties that the main characters would have been confronted to. More specifically on the acting, Dwayne Johnson's acting I found to be quite stale and soporific. His emotions were really non existent and it was quite difficult to believe in the role that he tried to embody. From a technical standpoint, some of the catastrophe scenes seemed completely fake, especially the tsunami where you could see that this was a not-so-well 3D processed material. Most of the times, I found the see to be completely fake and unrealistic. This movie really over-painted the main characters as superheroes in front of a super-great catastrophe but realistically ? It seems like they would be always the first people to find some sort of idea when the rest 'normal people' would be running crazily around and dying - ; extremely predictable like always. Conclusion, this movie is really everything I kind of distaste about action movies, hence why I have been boycotting them the last few years. The script is alway in favor or the main protagonist but this time it was SO conspicuous that it was ridiculous, agonizing and pathetic.2012 cheaper version 2.0 a.k.a San Clich√© Where to start? Well I guess I'll write a review with spoilers because things NEEDED to be said. In short the movie is HORRIBLE, it is literally a bad copy of a bad movie (2012). There are so many similarities that the story borders (and step over) plagiarism. Guy who divorced babe that in turn married jerk, ends up hooking back with the old lady because he save her from natural catastrophe and because jerk died. MANY scenes are almost identical in context to 2012 scenes, like couple hugging and peacefully waiting for the wave while everybody is going crazy.  How about the 2012 scene when they drive a limo trough a office building? Well that scene is in this movie too, but is a boat, not a limo. But the scene is the very same, as the building collapses they rush to get trough. Look at the credits for this movie: Carlton Cuse (screenplay) Liar you copied the movie! Andre Fabrizio (story) Another liar, you copied the movie! Bawhaha coping much these days?  And what's up with the biceps over exposure? He should really go back to the rings, where biceps and extremely bad acting belongs. San Andreas is a localized 2012. When the best actor of the movie is a 12 year old kid you KNOW that there is something wrong. There are dozens of "last second save" when in a good movie that is something that CANNOT surpass the count of (MAX OK?!) two. Literally all the time, tens of last sec saves. This movie should be call "Cheesy world of Murphy's law". Dwayne Johnson had many many opportunities to prove himself to be an actor, and he did not. He is 100% better than "Fabius". Fabius has one expression for all occasions, Dwayne has two, the sad and the happy one, although sometimes is confusing and we misinterpret happy for sad and vice versa. Impossible and ultra mega pro ridiculous things happen all the time. I'll write about some. For instance, tilting a helicopter sideways to go down into a canyon so the Helli fits into the gap DOES NOT explain how can you do the same to get out of the canyon. Maybe the gap widened while he was in... In another scene a guy get's a piece of glass the size of a pack of cigarettes shoved into his leg, then comes the girl and pulls the glass out like it is a little torn, very easily with the tips of her fingers, and to finish the ridiculous scene she ties a piece of cloth on his leg like she is tying her shoes. NO! The tying deal Mr director is to CUT BLOOD CIRCULATION so one don't die. So the knot has to be SUPER TIED, OK!? Not a cute band-aid of cloth. Uber ridiculous and unreal. In another surreal scene Dwayne drives a propeller boat very fast in waters that are literally full of debris. We barely can see the water because of the amount of debris floating on the water. Mr. director/writer the propeller is gonna be blown in 1000 pieces in a real similar situation. Next time try to give them a jet boat, or slow down the boat, OK?! You cannot drive a propeller boat over debris that fast... Yet another super ridiculous scene is when Dwayne has a gun pointed to his face at a distance of 5 inches. But as we all know he is faster than light. He takes the gun from the assailant's hand before getting shot in the face. Yeah, just like on the real world! The movie is like Call of Duty. We go from helicopter to truck to plane to parachute to boat to.. well I stopped the movie before the end, but I bet they will end up in the space shuttle. How about Carla Gugino acting? The world is ending and she is making jokes and making advances on her ex. She is sad, now she is smiling, now she is sad, now she is horny. Ridiculous surreal acting and directing. Yeah like we saw a LOT of people smiling on the day Katrina stroke New Orleans. Writers directors and actors, when a catastrophe of this magnitude happens, NO ONE LAUGHS FOR AT LEAST A WEEK! OK?! At the end, the daughter is "dead" for like 5 minutes or so after drowning. Square one, she now is brain damaged, OK mr "writer"?! Square two... I would give a 2 for this movie if the girl died, but in the end, just yet another clich√©: guys gives dead person cpr for 5 minutes and nothing happens, guy gives up.. (one more minute of winning) guy tries again, and all of the sudden dead comes to life... Clich√© - Clich√© - Clich√© - Clich√© - Clich√© - Clich√© - Clich√© - Clich√© - Clich√© - Clich√© in a fraction of a second I can remember 2 recent movies that did the very same: Sorcerer apprentice, terminator salvation. I probably could find tens of them. If you have an IQ of 40 or more let me save you money and time: DO NOT WATCH THIS JUNK! DO NOT RENT IT, DO NOT BUY IT. You have been warned!! I'll rate it 1 only because I cannot rate zero or negative, because if I could, I most certainly would. And to finish, what makes me really angry is that some real life jerk got paid thousands if not millions of dollars to "write" this. Next time don't make a movie and send the money to Africa, or some Asian country for the relief of the poor. That would be a win win scenario, helping the needed and saving us from junk products like this.  I'll never watch a Dwayne Johnson movie again! I don't want EVER see him, his biceps or his triangular head ever again.
How to make an entire book fandom hate you I am so unbelievably unhappy with this movie! The writer of the script has completely dissed the original most exciting plot from the books to some stupid ridiculous mainstream apocalyptic story. None of this happens in the book. None of it makes sense. It's called "The Scorch Trials" as in trials from wickd. Not some stupid escape adventure! I was so excited for this movie and I'm going to be honest, I left the cinema fuming with anger. If you're going to create a movie based on a book, actually go by the book plot. Don't make you're own and expect everyone to be happy with it. I'm sure the writer of the movies just ticked off an entire fandom.Original Story Line Butchered so Badly the Film Lost it's Cohesion It is as if the concern of the producers and story writers were so focused on the movie's DBOX worthiness that they forgot to include the story line. I went to this movie with two friends that have not read the books, as I have. Both walked out of the movie confused..."Where did the virus come from?" was the first question that they asked.  The beginning of the movie should have included the reason why W.I.C.K.E.D. created the Maze, explained what the Flare is, and introduced both groups of Maze runners. Instead, the audience is lost in visual effects without knowing why the action is happening. To add insult to injury, the writers turn the virus infected people into inhuman, biologically altered zombies. The immune are now a commodity for a short term fix to the virus problem. So much has been lost by these adaptations that the result is a vague and confusing zombie flick. I almost walked out. This was a wonderful book that should have been an incredible movie.Back to the same YA adaption you've seen before.... While the first Mazerunner set itself away from the pack of YA Dystopian future film adaptations, Scorch Trials jumps on the bandwagon. I even got them all confused at one point. Isn't there a 'scorch' and a 'wall' that prevents those why-are-we-so-dangerous Divergents from crossing the void? Isn't there a great dictator and our 'only hope' youngling who vows to 'kill' him/her in Hunger Games? Isn't there a group of important-but-we-don't-really-know-why kids running around in Kanye West's latest fashion line in both of those films? The first Mazerunner kept the mystery, pace, energy, and most importantly action, all at such a great length and mood of importance, that it was hard not to like. Scorch Trials tries to keep that energy, but this time around it feels forced and misdirected. Not to mention the run-time that is completely unnecessary. Like 'Mad Max' the plot is thin. They escape, they run, they escape again, run some more, a little bit more escaping, they run again, they escape once more, and end the film with.... we have to go back and 'finish' this. Finish what?! What is so damn important?! We don't know because the whole film works like a long filler episode of television. Just as two characters are about to reveal hidden memories to one another or answer important plot questions, they stop! I find that to be unbearable and annoying (especially since it occurs several times from beginning to end.)You never have a single conversation end in this film. It's all hints, hints... nothing. And once the film ends, it ends with two lines that make no sense. "I'm going to kill her." Why? Does that stop WKD? Nope. Then a response. "What is your plan?" --as our hero responds with a look out in the distance-- we cut to black..... because you don't have a f*cking plan. Because none of you have a f*cking plan. There is a constant mood in this film, and the Divergent films, and the Hunger Games, that something is important, some kind of a minuscule idea is important, but we're gonna take 8 films to kinda-sorta find out what that important thing is. Consensus? I now consider the first Mazerunner a great film that'll have to stand on its own. Skip Scorch, or wait for DVD. The good things? One or two moments of action (not scenes) that are well done. And in general the scope, set pieces, and CGI are top notch.What the Hell¬Ö? Short version: Read the book, but don't see the movie. OR, go see the movie, but don't read the book. Just DON'T do both. Long version: There really are no words to describe how far away this movie was from the book. It was like going into a theater expecting to see The Terminator, and seeing Braveheart instead. Both great movies, but NOTHING similar about them. Besides the character names, lightening, and some sand, NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING about this movie resembled ANY part of the book. Nothing. I read the book in one day, two days before I saw this movie. I was so excited to see this fantastic book come to life, and I left sorely disappointed. I'm not sure if the author of the book was involved at all in the decisions that went into the writing of this movie, but they completely bastardized, completely changed EVERYTHING about his story. Even the core motivation behind the 'who and the why' was different. It simply was not the same story at all. I've seen many books made into movies and I'm familiar with the huge and often disappointing changes they inevitably make, but this was off the charts. I've never seen anything like it. If you haven't read the books, then go see it. It was fun enough. But please don't bother if you enjoyed the original story; because it's a completely different one.Not so a-maze-ing I really enjoyed watching the first Maze Runner but I didn't think this was quite as good. The Scorch Trials got some great and intense, action packed scenes, good acting and cool environments but that's it. If you liked the first movie you may like this too or you may get a little disappointed. Don't have so high hopes on this movie.I still enjoyed it a bit but I think it got many bad parts. I'm not a fan of zombies so I hated the Idea with zombies in the desert or (infected people with a virus, Cranks). Everything is about Thomas in this movie. Everyone knows him and he does not know them. He does not even want to know who they are. That's so weird. I got tired of everyone calling his name. It felt like there was never a scene without Thomas in it.  I think the most irritating part is that Thomas and the others do everything they can to escape from the "WICKED", they go out in the scorch and some of them dies. Later on one friend of his is getting caught by the WICKED again and Thomas decides that he will turn around. They barely even made it out from the scorch and now they turn back after 2hours of the film because one friend got caught? (also because he realized he wants to fight the WICKED now and not run away anymore). It felt like a meaningless adventure. I think they could just skip to the 3rd movie right away.So much wrong with this film. I really liked Maze runner, but still don't understand why they didn't just build a ladder to the top of the wall and walk out. This movie was full of WTF stupid moments that really bugs me. Like why didn't they just turn off the generator when they noticed that that's what brought the zombies to life?! Instead they just leave it on and like Monty Pithon they run away, run away! When Brenda and Thomas see that creepy growing red stuff on the walls of the sewer, anyone else, after all they have been through would have taken one look and said nope, I'm outta here, but instead they have to go fully investigate this dangerous looking creepy stuff. They could have found a better way to have Brenda get infected. When Thomas makes an impossible heroic save of Brenda from falling to the ground through the glass, are we really supposed to assume they had no trouble at all getting back to the doorway above and clear from danger?! When that guy is shooting the big gun off the back of the truck, first of all he is a horrible shot not able to hit a huge helicopter and second, why didn't he shoot the transport before the kids got on it. All the bad people were on it and ripe for the killing and yet he does nothing.  I also thought Mary's character was way too short lived. Brenda and Thomas relationship was not played out well enough and I really don't like Teresa. Traitor bitch ;) Also couldn't they find a better song than After Midnight? AC/DC or Disturbed or something that sounded like destruction would have made for a better scene.  I have not read the books, but maybe the film would be better if they hadn't heavily diverted away. Either way I think it was lazily written and I want my $6 back! LolVapid sequel that raises serious questions about the point of the first film If you're a teenager looking for some adventure that isn't all "dark" and "gritty" - the buzz words of films nowadays - then you may enjoy this. If, however, you can't stop asking WHY? constantly, then you'll most likely end up hating it. The Maze Runner wasn't a very good film; in fact, I only watched this because I was in the room with somebody who wanted to see it, so I gave it a chance just to see if an explanation for the first film came about. The surviving teens from the Maze Runner link up with kids from other Mazes, and the first one of them to arrive at the prison-like complex shows Thomas, the film's hero, enough to make him question a conspiracy against the teens... that soon leads to them making an escape. With zombie-like creatures beyond the complex, the teens go from out of the frying pan into the fire, as they discover that they are immune to the virus, which is why the were sent to the mazes in the first place. Okay, so if they're immune, why did one of them get infected? No, that's not a spoiler, it's actually what we all expect to happen given the amount of zombie films we've all seen, but if you can let that go, you can carry on. The teens then reach a settlement and decide that they want to hook up with the resistance, because The Hunger Games are so popular. I mean, there may be another reason, but in an apparently hopeless world, one would imagine that their best bet would be to seek out land to cultivate and become the new leaders of society... after all, isn't that what the Glade was preparing them for?  No, it wasn't. In fact, the motives behind the first film are never explained, but instead just become more and more ridiculous as the plot plods along, clich√© and clich√©. Let's face it: if Wicked already has medicine but requires the immune teenagers to obtain it, why stick them all in Mazes around the world to watch them get killed off?  If you can get past that, the end is another big clich√© that absolutely no-one will ever see coming (irony), and then Thomas stands up, gives a speech and we can expect the decimated "resistance" to rise up against the evil enemy who doesn't seem to use lethal force against them, despite them using real bullets on Wicked's troops, in a third installment. I bet you can't wait for it.Terrible, terrible, terrible! A film with little substance or meaning. Zero plot, zero character development and zero fulfillment after watching. Cardboard actors, poor plot line (wasteland zombie survival by inexperienced 'teens' with luck on their side). I simply cannot understand why Hollywood can continue to churn out such condescending and boring films like this which cost a fortune to make (wow - must be good if cost $100million!). I can only think that Hollywood marketing overrules common sense of young adults whom Hollywood execs think are easy to hoodwink to pay and watch tripe like this. It's up to you, but if you go and watch this and waste your money watching the same, then don't blame me for not warning you. Total garbage and about 2 out of 10 from a film lover with 35 years viewing experience.Spends most of its time setting up the conclusion... First of all, I didn't want to go and see this movie especially because I saw the first part and while I was watching it I was really interested in knowing why they were tested in the maze or who Thomas and Teresa were, what they did before they were cast out into the maze, etc... but unfortunately I got none of this answers, but what I did get were a lot more mysteries but no answers, but it's not like LOST where it leaves the audience thinking and putting things together and finding out the mysteries, but it's more of a dull and predictable mysteries every time they have some of the main characters talk to each other. This movie starts where the other one picked off, both in action and in mysteries, you will get 0 answers as to how the virus infected the world, or how the world was destroyed as it is, or what is the cure, and mainly you will see that there is no real motivation to be on wither side WICKD or the Gladers, because in fact what separates their motivations is just the way they use the antidote and nothing more, here there's more illogicalness than clever writing or a logical explanation of why Thomas and the others are against WICKD, but yeah the movies spends more of its time giving you more mysteries and making you more interested in seeing the final conclusion than actually put some sense into this chapter...  Next, the dialogues are extremely clich√©-d like: "you're not working as fast as I need you", or "the boss arriving sooner than expected", "come on let's go!", etc, etc... you get the picture. Although I might be ignored, cause every useful reviews on this are from people who think this movie is awesome, I need to say my opinion and save the money of some people who want to go see this movie hoping it's a good one. More, it seems like every time there is a dialog that can reveal key plot points or mysteries, or memories, is cut short and the subject quickly changes to something else, and it gets really frustrating, I was laughing as hard as I could with my friend in the cinema, while watching things like that or glass that breaks, then suddenly not breaks, then finally breaks, it's like the glass listens to the movie script, just like other things like storm or zombies.  This movie got so bad, that at one point where it turned ridiculously clich√©-d and mysterious beyond any measure, I thought of leaving the cinema, but I stayed out of respect for my friends who invited me to see it, cause I would NEVER see a movie so clich√©-d and stupidly mysterious(I couldn't find any other words) in my life again. This is just an insult to an intelligent mind because this movie just wants to be too clever but ends up setting more mysteries and events for the next movie than it resolves the mysteries or conflicts it already has.  Even though there isn't a "Maze Runner" title to show at the beginning of the movie, this movies feels ridiculously stupid about running in every scene of the movie. All the conflicts or natural disasters end up with the Young Adults running from those things. And yeah, you heard me correctly, even the natural disasters are chasing the kids. At this point I was having 0 expectations from the movie, and it didn't surprised me after that, being only more clich√©-d and predictable, not even zombie's scares didn't frighten me, and honestly I remained with pretty much nothing after this movie, unlike after I watch movies from Stephen Spielberg, Nolan, Scorsese, Ron Howard, etc, etc...  So to wrap up this review, don't go and see this movie, unless you are bored to death and want to have some fun and laugh at how bad this movie really is. By the way, the movie's rating is way too high, this shows just how easily people are fooled and how easily their money are wasted on things like this. This movie's real rating should be around 5-6, but until it gets there(which probably won't happen) I stick with 1.Gag movie of the year Oh how I wish I'd seen a trailer that showed the absurd zombie incarnations. Gag me with a spoon. Now I'm supposed to issue a SPOILER ALERT... although to give away this plot is laughable it is so formulaic and predictable. The entire premise of the movie is absurd. Fast paced to nowhere with lots of movement, little action, noisy and pointless.  Gee, the obtuse teenager tries to save his buddies from having their blood sucked out of them by the mean scientists and from being bitten by the zombie creatures. And the soldier group -- the right wing so to speak -- are so rag tag as to be an impossible group to put up any kind of struggle against the crack troops of WCKD... wicked. (wasn't that clever!)  When searching for the rag tag group, they get stuck in a canyon behind cars left to barricade their hiding place. Then they get attacked -- are you ready -- with the ubiquitous helicopters that everyone in the known universe knows WCKD has... except the right appendage (I don't want to give away their clever name). Just wish this group had gotten lost in the maze.Laziest zombie movie i have ever watched. ***this review may contain spoilers*** It is undeniable that this movie has its fair share of thrills, stunning CGI scenes and unique yet realistically gory zombies. However, there is nothing more to that. It jumps from scene to scene without enough plot to give the audience a sufficient sense of appreciation as to why the characters are doing what they do. I could hardly believe it when the movie ended, 2 hours wasted on what could have been time playing "left 4 dead 2" and still leaving me with the same feeling - the 'that was thrilling but a complete waste of time' feeling.  I'm going to keep this a short and simple, almost lazy review. Because that is exactly how I feel about this movie.Nice movie on so many levels! To begin with, I have to let you know that I was not aware of the existence of any book before I saw the first and second movie. So, comments like "you ruined the book", etc. don't make sense to me.  I saw the first movie on a DVD and this one in the movie theater. For me it was pure entertainment for the entire duration of the movie! I liked the thrilling scenes and the chase from the zombie like people. At some points I could not help but thinking that it a PS4 game and at some point they would turn over the control of the actors to me and I would be left alone clicking on X or L1/R1 to run as fast as I can! I liked that but many may not like it. For me this was awesome! The acting was OK, as expected and really similar to the first one. It's not like you wait to see an Oscar-winning performance there, right? I really enjoyed all the special effects and the amazing scenes from the cities that are crumbling and falling apart. The movie seemed a lot longer than it is. The action-packed and full story behind it, gave too much information and left me feeling really "full" after watching it and this was not because of the XXL pop corn that I ate!  I will go to the movies to see the third one, with excitement! And yes, it definitely is an "8" in its genre. "7" felt like a minimum, so I would easily give a "7.5" with pleasure! If you don't like this kind of post-apocaliptic stories, wait till it's out in DVD, don't spend money in the movies. If you do like them, go and see it, like yesterday!As an action packed movie, great. As a movie adaption, horrible. If you've read the series and love it, please do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. This movie has taken the book that you love and change it into a mainstream zombie survival movie. When I first watch The Maze Runner, I really like it because even though they did change some stuff, they're at least stick to the storyline and have most of the plot. So when I heard that The Scorch Trial movie just comes out, I expect it to be as great, or even better than than the first movie. Which turns out to be a great disappointment and makes me leave the cinema feeling angry and disappointed. They really change the storyline and twisted the plot. For a starter, The Scorch Trial supposed to be another trial from WICKED. And they change it into an escape with WICKED hunts them and try to get them to get back to WICKED which is supposed to be the part of The Death Cure. Seriously, what's happen to the silvery liquid who eats people head and turn it into a ball, an epic journey across the scorch and the betrayal scenario? We understand that it's kind of hard to make a movie that is exactly like the book, but if you're going to make a movie adaptation from a book, at least follow the book plot. You can't make your own storyline and expect the book fandom to be happy with it.Less A-Maze-ing than the First Installment ¬†¬†¬†¬† Last year's 'The Maze Runner' was en route to a non-conformist course off the young adult/post-apocalyptic sub-genre, delivering less familiar but appealing deviations from the more recognizable standards of the category. This year, 'The Scorch Trials', its sequel, keeps some of the original beats of its predecessor, but it eventually falls into the scope of the overly familiar trope that the first film has defiantly avoided, which is a bit disappointing, considering the riveting buildup they've pulled off with the first film. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Much of this film is spent in running. That doesn't necessarily makes the film bereft of sense and extremely difficult to follow, but that fact itself, hinders the proceedings from delivering a comprehensible narrative. 'The Gladers', still led by Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), are now on the run from the forces of WCKD, the mysterious organization that placed them in the Glade. What even worse, are Cranks, James Dashner's version of zombies, joining the pursuit. After seemingly endless cat and mouse chases, you'd be thankful to see them stumble upon a resistance movement, giving them a few moments to rest (that gives you a moment to rest from following them). But that's just a bump, because as soon as alliances are formed and a hint of the government's agenda, is revealed, it's marathon-time again. ¬†¬†¬†¬† See, that's what sends this sequel spiraling down from the heights the first film has soared past in 2014. It lacks genuine emotions, and there are barely plot developments well- knitted enough to spark interest. The marathon extravaganza hampers the characters to fully connect with each other, and engage in a conversation, lengthy enough to help us understand. That's maybe the problem for someone who hasn't read the book like me, ever loaded with 'how's and 'why's, which this sequel seems uninterested in answering, until the final chapter. That being said, there are still some few things to commend, like the fact it has retained, if not improved, its scares and thrills. The Grievers are now replaced by hungrier and grotesquely more vicious Cranks, and the obstacles are updated, to provide more hair raising creeps. The first movie's $340million worldwide cume against its $34million budget has given this sequel a bigger financial resource for production, and you would thank that for 'The Scorch Trials' stunningly choreographed setpieces, looming up in and between adrenaline- propelled pursuits.  Some new characters, like Aiden Gillen's Rat-Man, are introduced, but the rest or more than half of movie's payroll's new names, are barely, if not efficiently, utilized. That's an inevitable additional layer to the heap of flaws that piled up for this outing, but it's extremely hard to completely shrug off the film, especially with an interesting, and riproaring climax, that pretty sets the stage for the trilogy's final phase. While that last chapter is yet to happen, let's pray for the last film to never get split into two. 6/10Disappointed and irritated I recommend any and all who have respect for a writers work and/or have ever read the maze runner series, don't watch the second movie. It was a good movie but it should not have been released under the title scorch trials as it had no relevance what's so ever to the second book or the trials themselves, which is literally the title. I am very disappointed/Very much irritated. The only resemblance to the book was the character names. This also felt like a very sore excuse for a zombie movie instead of having the proper and well thought out story line that manipulated the characters like originally intended. Overall, I say again the movie would be fine on its own with no relation whatsoever with the series but because it is in fact based off of a book series I am very disappointed to see they threw the whole series aside and made up their own story. Very disappointed, I cannot say that enough times.Review This so called sequel to the Maze Runner is completely a waste of time for anyone who is expecting any similarities to the original Maze Runner. It is full of nonsensical fighting, clueless people, zero plot, a shame to actually be associated with "The Maze Runner". If possible, take this movie back to the recording studio and delete each and every sequence of it and Think and make a sensible adventurous movie. Crappies movie of all times! It's not only misleading from the word "Runner" but also there is no Maze! Isn't it fantastic? The Scorch Trials! What does that even mean and how does the name actually is relevant to this pathetic low standard movie!Full of Action Sequel After escaping from the Maze, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Teresa Agnes (Kaya Scodelario), Frypan (Dexter Darden) and Winston (Alexander Flores) are welcomed by Mr. Janson (Aidan Gillen) in a protected facility. They meet other survivors from other mazes and they learn that everyday, a group of teenagers is summoned to be lodged in farms and communities in safe areas. However Thomas decides to investigate what happens with the teenagers and he meets Aris Jones (Jacob Lofland). Soon they find that the place is a WCKD facility and Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) is alive and the leader of experiments with the teenagers that are intubated neither alive nor dead. Further, his group will be the next to be guinea pigs. Thomas and Aris succeed in escaping with the other Gladers from the facility and they decide to search the resistance group The Right Arm that is hidden at the mountains. Along their journey, they find the post-apocalyptic world completely destroyed; they meet the Cranks, zombies infected by the Flare virus; they have the loss of a friend; they face storm in the desert and a dangerous group of survivors; and they are betrayed by a friend. Now Thomas and his friends want revenge against the WCKD and Thomas promises to kill Ava Paige.  "Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials" is a full of action sequel of "Maze Runner'. The story has a predictable plot point disclosing that one character is a traitor. There is no explanation why the teenagers needed to stay in the Glade and why the WCKD wanted them submitted to the situations against the Grievers of the previous movie. Maybe the explanation will be given on the next film. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "Maze Runner: Prova de Fogo" ("Maze Runner: Really Tough Test").More entertaining than the first installment Let's get this straight out of the way. If you are tired of movies based on books that present a young cast, you won't find something here to convert you. However if you found the first movie to be a surprisingly entertaining, solid action flick;or if you don't mind the age of the main characters as long as the story deliveries, there's plenty to like here. Specially because there are some improvements over the flaws of the first film. The action sequences are gripping, well directed and have a feel of raw realism. It's evident that the ensemble of actors- young or mature- gave it all physically. It seems as though the stunts doubles had little to do in comparison to the average action flick. If in the first movie you got 2 or 3 action scenes to keep you in the edge of your seat,in The scorch trials you'll find action almost from the beginning.I'm not a fan of non-stop action, but I was particularly impressed with Barry Pepper who I heard filmed his action scenes with a broken ankle.  The acting is extremely good. Not only the young lead Dylan O'Brien and his young co-stars, Ki Hong Lee, Kaya Scodelario, Rosa Salazar and Thomas Brodie Sangter, deliver strong performances, but also the supporting cast of mature actors. By the way if you have read or heard that the very talented supporting cast of mature actors is there only for their paychecks or that "they have better things to do" you are hearing a biased opinion by unprofessional reviewers who are tired of "YA adaptations". But just because some reviewers are tired of this "subgenre" doesn't mean that plenty of talented cast and crews aren't fully involved with these kind of stories in spite of the studios greedy intentions.  This movie might not be perfect, might not be for everyone but one thing that you can tell for sure is that Barry Pepper, Alan Tudik, Aidan Gillen, Lily Taylor, Patricia Clarkson and particularly Giancarlo Esposito gave it all. They have amazing chemistry with the very talented young cast and they seem to be screaming "100% commitment to my role". It became clear to me through their committed performances that they believed in the project and that they trust the director Wes Ball. There's plenty of character development opportunities and these mature actors take advantage of them all even if their screen time is limited. Ava Paige as played by Patricia Clarkson started the movie as the archetypal "evil scientist" and by the end of the movie I was somehow rooting for her. She really needs to find a cure to this mysterious disease called "the flare". Giancarlo Esposito started limited by a role that seemed at first written to fulfill a quota of the typical "evil adult vs. innocent kid" trope. However, as the movie moves on we discover that he is far from being a cartnoonish "evil adult" and that his character is full of humanity. A scene in which he is concerned over his proteg√© was one of my favorites of a film from which I was only expecting mindless entertainment and non-stopping action. The problem is that this brilliant cast was limited by a script that seemed to go nowhere. I'd say the script is not as strong as the one of the first movie and that script wasn't particularly good to begin with. There are some improvements. This time some clich√©d lines have gone away, there's more backbone to the characters and a little more of "showing-not-telling". But if you are thinking that everything that didn't make sense in the first one will make sense in this movie you might end up disappointed. One more time the movie ends in a cliffhanger although this time there's not a last minute info-dump. If you don't mind these minor flaws on the script you might end up enjoying the ride. In my opinion, the strongest part of the movie, besides the thrilling action and good acting are the visuals. I enjoyed the shots of the scorch because the cinematographer took plenty of risks. I want to see the movie again just to appreciate these shots better. There were also interesting shots in terms of composition. The VFX is extremely well executed. I thought the director was going to get overboard with the CGI usage but he wisely balanced the visual effects with the emotional arc to take the audience to a journey through this devastated lands in which under each nook, each skeleton building lies a new danger, a new story, a new world which I'd love to explore.  As if this wasn't enough to make me want to see the movie again, Joe Paesano's score (Daredevil TV series, The maze runner) was masterfully used and added a special feeling to the already beautiful visuals. Mark my words, Paesano's scores will get him an Oscar somewhere in the near future. The scorch trials has everything to become a huge international box office success because is a solid, yet imperfect second chapter, that will keep audiences entertained and screaming for chapter 3.A waste of money and time! I just wasted 2 hours of my life thinking this film may be better than the first but no, giving every film a chance before judging it but no again, it was a shitshow.  First of all the plot was absolutely terrible! I read the book and even though the book kind of sucked this was seriously 100 times worse. Secondly they didn't explain anything, they must've skipped like 2/3 of the book and just took in the "cool" parts because it made no sense at all. First they ran off to a desert walking for 20 minutes, secondly they found some zombies, third walked somewhere, found some more zombies and oops WICKED hates us. Someone dies and poff the end.  They introduced about a 100 different unimportant characters and pretty much killed them ofimmediately. Most of them were flat and were just plot devices. No character development at all, seriously they stayed the same throughout the whole film. The cinematography part was alright, and the music was great. The acting wasn't half bad, sure they convinced me. But don't watch it, it's not worth your time.James Dashner, Wes Ball and T.S. Nowlin owe the readers an apology!!! *Warning, contains spoilers. Only read this review if you have read the books and seen both movies..* I went into 'The Scorch Trials' expecting the worst since 'Maze Runner' did such a horrible job with the story already. I didn't expect it to be this awful. Why even bother making a book into the movie if you are not even going to follow any of the story line? This movie had nothing to do with the books, first off I have a question for Nowlin (the screenplay writer) why call it the 'Scorch Trials' if there was no TRIAL?? The book had a trial that the kids had to pass; this movie had a bunch of kids escaping WCKD and running around in a desert. There was nothing that was remotely a trial about it. This movie had me so angry my eyes got watery and I had a migraine. Look, as someone who reads a lot of novels I understand that movies can't perfectly portray the books, but to have the audacity to take these fun, enthralling novels and turn them into a down-graded action pile of garbage, that's insulting to the readers. Any person I know who read the books and saw the movie was absolutely insulted and astonished. Let's focus on the movie flaws here for a moment in case you're wondering why I am so angry... ( if you care) 1.) Why do we already know about the Right Arm in this movie?? That's not until the third book. 2.) Why wasn't this a trial? What was so wrong with the MAIN plot of the book that you turned into a movie? 3.) Why did the cranks have roots? The cranks were supposed to have levels of being gone which made them interesting and not just a bunch of cgi, moronic monsters. 4.)Why was Thomas and Theresa incapable of having telepathy? 5.)How is it that all of them are immunes but Winston was killed immediately after a bite? 6.)Why was the scorch a desert? The scorch is supposed to be an unbearable terrain where you cant survive for long, it's supposed to show how badly the Flare effected the earth. 7.)Why did Nowlin feel that Thomas having 'killed by group B' written on his neck wasn't a fantastic edge-of-your-seat piece of the novel? I guess since he skimmed the book and decided to write his own story he threw all of the exciting and mysterious concepts of the novel out the window and make it a movie of running around not doing anything with any real substance. I really need those questions answered because my mind is actually blown, I cannot believe that the Director and Screenplay writer had the guts to call this movie 'The Maze Runner Series' I have two positives about the movie though. 1.) The actors were absolutely fantastic who ever cast this movie was probably the only one who read the books. That's what is super sad about this movie is the casting was great, but the story was absolute garbage. It looked like the actors read the books, and the director read the cliff notes. 2.) The visuals were gorgeous, it's too bad that I was focused on the failures of the writing. The craziest part about this series is if they had followed the books at least with the main plot lines and twists, this movie would have been bigger than 'The Hunger Games', but they decided to drop this awful movie onto the readers and make them suffer. James Dashner, as far as I have read in your interviews you were okay with this?? You owe your readers the BIGGEST apology ever! You sold yourself out for the cash, and I was going to read your other series but my friends and I will not touch anything you've written until we receive an apology for getting us hooked on your novels, and then approving this awful movie that had nothing to do with your books besides the character names and the title. Your books had so much more complexity to the story and the writer/director of the movie decided not to use any of your actual plot line. Doesn't that make you angry even a little bit? Wes Ball, T.s. Nowlin and James Dashner. Shame on all three of you. If you've read the books please avoid this movie like the plague. If you haven't read the books ( you shouldn't be reading my review lol) but if you accidentally did please read the books, and skip this awful movie. I could have covered at least 10 more disappointing points about this film, but no one wants to read a 20 paragraph review, this review was long enough. James Dashner, I await your apology for doing this to your readers.The critics don't know SH!T Well well, The Scorch Trials. What a great movie! From beginning to end, I was on the edge of my seat. Unlike the first, there's a lot more violence and death in this movie, and the Cranks are OH SO HORRIFYING! And as you may have expected, along with the Cranks comes lots of JUMP SCARES! This movie is super intense and action-packed that you won't want to look away for a moment. Also, there's a single scene about 35 minutes into the movie that shocked me. It wasn't meant to be a plot twist, but the way they pulled it off was incredible. Giving that away would be sad, so I want you to see it for yourself. Let's just say that it involves an quiet, emotional scene with a gun and a slowly growing infection through someone's body. Moving on... The thing I dislike is the lack of character development in the new characters introduced. Here's some random kid shown near the beginning, then when he only appears in the background and basically says nothing, I'm like 'Wait, who is he again?' when he finally begins to speak. The first movie was all about the action, but this one is all about the action and the PLOT. Oh yes, there is a plot twist near the end I didn't see coming, and it kind of involves a familiar character. So much happens in this movie that leaves your mind blown, and it leaves you off with a sort of cliffhanger. It will leave you saying 'The game is truly on...' except the game will be on in 2017. Shame. Overall, I say IGNORE THE CRITICS! They see this as Young Adult, which technically it is, but it's more of a Young Adult horror movie! It's certainly interesting. 8/10. Go see it!If you loved the first one, you'll love this one! Oh it is sad seeing all these reviews where people complain about this movie because it's different from the book. Well let me tell you, films based on books or comics and stuff like that change things around to make the movie stand on its own and be appealing to multiple people. There's no point in a movie that is exactly the same to its source material because that's only useful for people too lazy to read. If everyone knew this and understood it, perhaps people who don't like that idea could just stay away from the movies and keep to the books, this movie and countless others could be saved all that ruthless hate.  Anyway, back to the movie, I loved the first Maze Runner film. 9/10 and it became one of my favourite movie universes out of all the others like Hunger Games and Divergent. Now I have seen the next Maze Runner film and I loved it so much. I found it better than the first one! This is how I think sequels should be made. Where things stay true to the previous film so the sequel feels like a continuation of the story and not someone elses interpretation of what happens next. The action, the music, the emotion, the characters and the story I found was so fitting, exciting, entertaining and perfect for the Maze Runner movies. I haven't read the books, I personally don't care for them, but the movies are perfect enough for me, standing on their own. I had a great time with this movie and CAN'T WAIT for Death Cure. Unfortunately this movie and the previous one receives a lot of hate and I'm so disappointed so all I can say is if you liked the first one, go and see Scorch Trails.They turned a Good movie into a Walking Dead + Hunger Games knockoff. The first Maze Runner movie I really enjoyed watching and would watch again. This movie did a complete 180 though and just destroyed the series. Instead of taking the good and improving on the first one, this movies is basically just hunger games, trying to get away from the bad guys just to get caught type of stuff, and hunger games, these infected human/zombie like creatures chasing people around. Normally I'd still give a movie a chance but I just couldn't. One main reason is the CGI for this movie, it was just laughable. CGI was used for all of the infected characters chasing the main group around and it just looked like CG from movies and video games from 5 years ago, just terrible. They go so far from the book plot line it's ridiculous too. If you want to see it wait until it comes out to online rental or redbox or video store. It's not worth paying to see in theaters. Also warning to adults taking kids, this movie is closer to an R rating than a PG-13, it's a really far stretch that they made it only PG-13.Only watch if you're a masochist The movie itself is _just_awful. Half the dialog seems to be "go, just go". Yeah, really.  But my biggest problem with the flick (and books for that matter) is that fact that they're just one big lazy rip-off of every YA post-holocaust survival test story we've ever heard of. It's one thing to do a genre piece - it's another to not even present logical reasons for the 'cool' stuff you want in your story.  eg. @ WCKD headquarters (oh they can't be serious with that hyper-obvious name?!):  WCKD Scientist 1: "These teens have the secret to beating the disease"  WCKD Scientist 2: "Oh cool, let's run some blood tests, check their DNA, maybe do some CAT scans..."  WCKD Scientist 1: "Naaah, why don't we basically re-create that historic TV show Big Brother, add a dash of 'Survivor', and somehow that will tell us what's so special about these kids!"  WCKD Scientist 2: "Oh, well, yeah....why didn't I think of that?! It'll certainly give us plenty of opportunity for people who don't ask too many questions about a plot to gaze mindlessly at the screen when we broadcast it....yeah, let's make some money!!" Further to that, this movie has...wait for it.....zombies. Yes, that staple of so many low-grade flicks and TV shows these days, zombies. Could the writer have tried just one iota harder to come up with something original? Apparently not. Final verdict? Don't waste your time on this one ...you'll hate yourself for it if you do, lol =)Not having read the book versions, cinema-wise 'Scorch' a different but great follow up. When we last left off in (2014) 'The Maze Runner', Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and the remaining clan of youths whom managed to escape the ever evolving maze, were seemingly rescued from an abandoned science laboratory by a band of armed rebels. If you've wondered where exactly the rescued are being flown to by the helicopter at the conclusion of that film, the answer lies in the recently released second installment of the trilogy, 'The Scorch Trials'.  Upon landing in an apocalypses world of wasteland and chaotic battle of people, the clan is rushed into an enormous security facility, in which a high tech vault door shuts behind them shielding them from all the dangers of the outside world. Upon meeting, Mr. Janson (Aidan Gillen) whom is the head of the facility, he explains that they are here among many other survivors from similar mazes. The clan's secure feelings of being in a safe haven become short lived when circumstances reveal to Thomas that Mr. Janson is not who he makes himself out to be. Discovering that the clan and all the other youths are being targeted and set up as guinea pigs again for another test due to their immunity to the world-wide virus outside, the clan escapes; only to enter a world almost beyond recognition. Running away in a big city lost in sand and rubble, they also fight for survival from bizarre weather occurrences caused by the solar flare epidemic explained to them in the end of 'The Maze Runner'. They embark on a journey where they must seek to build alliances with apocalypse survivors; however having the shaky task of trying to discern who really is good and who is bad.  What I particularly loved most of all in the world that director Wes Ball has created was the exterior settings. Unless I missed it, there has never been mention of how long ago the world's fallout was supposed to have occurred. However; in contrast to many apocalypse themed movies where you find empty damaged cities with freeways with old cars frozen in space on the roads long abandoned, the wastelands here reminds me of the ancient ruins you'd find of Rome. Freeway overpasses are only half in place, skyscrapers look like building skeletons, and tall bridges are sunken into tower high piles of sand. While I've always got the vibe that since film number 1 that the fallout occurred as long as a century ago, the visuals seems to suggest of what America might look like thousands of years from now if it were to fall.  Like many science fiction movies that are made for entertainment but also has undertone spiritual or political themes that not everyone may catch onto, for me, 'The Scorch Trials' seemed to have some themes that are relevant in today's society. I will restrain myself from pacifically declaring what theme that would be since I believe it would clue off too much of a spoiler about plot, but for the time being, think about that old rationalizations philosophy by some people who believe the bad things must be done for the greater good. While there are many eerie far-fetched things that you will experience in seeing what happens to humans inflicted with the solar flare virus, Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) whom works amongst scientists, brings to surface something that could be seen as a plausible scenario in the far future of America. I believe that what this character wants to do in this story, echoes an issues that you will find in today's media in a much smaller scale.  Along with the already great established cast, two interesting new actors show up in portraying both the antagonist and uncertain antagonist. Probably best known for the slick, charming manipulative character, Littlefinger in HBO's current hit, 'Games of Thrones', Aidan Gillen nicely plays one of the head men from the lab who puts on two faces. Then there is Giancarlo Esposito whose been playing projected bad guys in TV over the last several years: such as the rebel and militant Tom Neville in (2012-2014) 'Revolution', the iconic double personality Gus Fring in seasons 2- 4 in AMC's, (2008-2013) 'Breaking Bad', and even time to time appears in ABC as Sidney Glass/Magic Mirror in (2011- ) 'Once Upon a Time'. Here Esposito plays a personality who wrestles between antagonist and protagonist as an ally of the youth clan.  If you are like me whose been waiting to see this film until the last minute, now would be the time to see it; as it is now appearing to me that the lifespan torch of 'The Scorch Trials) is about to get snubbed out in the town I live in. Personally, I enjoyed the first 'Maze Runner' a little bit more than this new installment probably because the maze was such a mystical place of mystery. However; I did at the same time find it just as enjoyable.Better than the first but still has issues After having escaped the Maze, the Gladers now face a new set of challenges on the open roads of a desolate landscape filled with unimaginable obstacles. Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is better than the first film in the Series but just like with the first Maze Runner film the plot is not good and the narrative goes back and forth for the entire running time of 131mins (which is a bit too much as well). But unlike with the previous film there's a bit more action this time and the scene with the Zombies was good and it's cgi better than i was expecting plus we get some new faces and some new villains too but it's plot at times leads nowhere and even tho it's talented cast tries and succeeds the film's script doesn't do what it's meant to be. Overall Maze Runner 2 is better than the first movie in the Franchise but still not as good as it could have been. (6.5/10)Solid as ***k Those who read the book are disappointed. Its easy to see by reading the comments, but we who didn't read the book mostly liked it. Truth is, its a very solid adventure movie, and more entertaining than the first one in the installment. Fast paced with a lot of nice visual effects work. Even the ending was satisfying, a good cliff hanger when the group gets split up. Must also mention John Paesanos score which adds greatly to most of the scenes. He will win an Oscar some day, no doubt. Looking forward to Death Cure.A movie about going from industry locations to the next... The first movie had our attention peaked, even though it was abit on the lame side - men the second movie is a horrid adaption of so many other movies like it before - story is slow, boring and all you see is the group change from one compound or industry site to the next...... so much mix bix and twix.....  Avoid it, it will be a waste of time... And everything is so poorly explained, that you never really get excited about anything - just more and more locations shifts.... always somewhere new to go....  I think... and i am being honest here that you will get more out of a cold shower than this movie.Should not have been made I actually enjoyed the first installment of these movies (Mazerunner).. and I say first because it looks as though they have a long and healthy plan to continue the movie franchise for as long as they can possibly milk it. This movie, Scorch Trials, literally gave me a severe headache. Lots of noise and flashing lights all to no avail. Thank God, this is another movie I was able to catch for free on Xfinity. I was wondering why such a recent movie was being offered for 'free' already, when many others hang in there at a premium rental cost. Now I know. I was almost expecting to see the cast somehow caught again in the original maze or another maze, etc. Nope. It is all about escaping their rescuers, some desert roaming and Thomas' usual ridiculous and unrealistic antics. Not only do you get Scorch Trials, but you are also able to view mini rip off scenes from at least half a dozen different, previous movies. Really embarrassing.. For example: you get some 'Walking Dead' zombies, along with a lot of Walking Dead rip off ideas such as getting infected by a scratch by said zombie, pre-zombies found having committed suicide, using zombies as sport in the betting ring, etc.. You get some Z-nation too where the surviving tribes use zombies as guard dogs, tied up on chains.. You get some Star Wars with their advanced flying machines.. Oh, and some Daywalkers with the harvesting of blood and hanging donors. All that shooting in the end, both helicopters could have easily been shot at and the Dr. could have been killed.. Instead they watch them fly away, then Thomas has the brilliant idea to go after them on foot.. because he is going to take them down..(which leaves it open to a 3rd installment movie).. You really see how much of an Ahole Thomas' character is.. A one man, apparently psychic, maverick with advanced skills and moves (because being abandoned in the elements does that to you).. He spends the entire movie obsessed about the girl, again, only to get betrayed by her. Never mind the remaining survivors barely made it and called any future attempts a suicide mission; evidently Thomas is about to lead them once again. That's one headache I'll skip. Not every novel needs to be made into a movie. This is a prime example.Easily the worst 'blockbuster' I have seen in a long time This is the movie that just keeps on giving ...old tired clich√©s, logic holes, loud, inappropriate music and regurgitated movie 'tried and trues'. A surprisingly good first movie is followed by a ...tired zombie remake? I had not read the book first (because if you read the book first, you will ALWAYS be disappointed with the movie) but from other user comments this is not the plot of the book at all, so they just threw in zombies because hey, zombies are all the rage now, and we have all the props and makeup, so why not? Unlike the last movie when the characters actually had to figure things out, let's make all the characters (especially the young?) dumb and just throw them in loud confrontation after another. Can you say 'studio cash grab'? We can just ignore the gaping hole that is their version of zombies (not even THEORETICALLY possible? How do they move? Why do they move? Forget 'Why brains?' Why eat, considering that they have no digestion? How do they shamble and still be faster than everyone else? How do they move? Why move at all? Oh, that darn 'logic'.)Horrible Representation of the True Storyline There's only one thing you need to know before watching this movie: It does NOT correlate with the book/true story line whatsoever. I understand there has to be some difference from written story to movie script, but the creators of this script paid no true homage to the actual plot of the book/any of its contents at all. If you haven't read the series I guess it's not as much of a loss. But as a fan of the series, this movie was actually hard to watch and I will not be seeing the third installment. I already know what happens from the books and I can't see any way they could even come back and make it semi-relatable to the books now. I love seeing the characters come to life, but some of the actor/actress choices in this movie were not even close to how they were described in the book. It was so poorly thought out and disappointing as a fan of the story. I'm not sure if the author had any say in the book to movie translation, but I feel really bad for him and how his story got twisted around. Very, very bad movie to the fan of the books.Awful and nonsensical dribble This is a one of those typical movies that is supposed to appeal to teenagers. The main hero is misunderstood by everyone, even other teens who are supposed to be his friends. He is also the most important person alive. Somehow, he is the only one who can save the entire human race. He has major memory holes in his mind, yet somehow he is the only one capable of understanding what goes on and making the choices for the good of himself and his friends. There are more non key details that make no sense. The movie is full of them. Like when the command is given to take Thomas and his friends alive, why do the guards immediately start shooting at them? Near the start of the movie, they are in a medical facility. The world is largely consumed by a plague. Thomas and his friend see some people been wheeled around on medical stretchers. Somehow this is highly suspicious. I mean no way can sick people be on stretchers in a hospital. Of course in this bizarre plot, the paranoia actually turns out to be correct. I guess there would be no movie otherwise. Anyway, I find it mind boggling that there are books and movies like this that portray doctors as evil and clueless teens as heroes in a world devastated by a plague. Hey I got an idea for a book/movie. In an overpopulated starving world, there are some fat cooks that oppress poor teens. A handful of starving teens heroically steal food from the kitchens to feed starving puppies.I have no intention of watching the third The first movie starts with a setting where everybody is a young male with amnesia (the laziest excuse to use so the protagonist needs everything to be info-dumped). This is not a good way to have a mystery. People are not trying to find the answer to a question, they are posing a question because the answer was taken. And of course the protagonist is the only one who is a special flake. Not only is he blank so everybody can easily identify with. Not only is he used as a lobotomized ask-man so everything needs to be explained to us. But on top of that in just 3 days he does things nobody else was capable to achieve in 3 years. Empowerment fantasy anyone? There is this guy who is constantly antagonizing him. He keeps hitting him and demands to stop being curious about the maze, when he is simply trying to find a way to get out, the same thing everybody is doing. The movie never justifies his actions, he is a one dimensional bully with no proper motivations. Then they throw a girl in the story, which offers nothing to the plot, she is there simply as a platonic girlfriend for the protagonist. I mean, seriously, the first thing she says is his name which instantly cock-blocks everybody else. We can't have anyone else going after the only girl in the show; she exists to be a prize for the empowerment fantasy that is the protagonist. Which still doesn't excuse why she wasn't gang-riped by everybody. How is it possible to have dozens of men in their sexual prime for 3 years who wouldn't go ape at the sight of a female? In fact why haven't any of them turned homo all this time? Three years without anyone having sex, how is that possible? And then comes the revelation at the end and it makes no sense. If the sun has scorched the earth, why were they fine under the sun? If these young people are the last hope of mankind, what was the point of stealing their memories, building a gigantic transforming maze, throwing them in the middle of a death trap where you are constantly killing them, and then making it seem to those who manage to escape the maze that the researchers who put them there were killed? Answer: There wasn't any. Their plan makes no sense. This leads us to the second movie which is a straightforward zombie apocalypse flick. The youths are taken to a new facility where they are harvested so a cure for the zombie virus can be found. Which makes sense, and is what the evil organization should be doing from the very beginning instead of wasting a fortune in making mazes and killing the ones they need to harvest. But that is too much to expect from a writer who named the organization Wicked. Seriously, that is the name of the evil organization: Wicked. So much thought put into it. Anyways, they manage to escape this new facility pretty easily, something nobody else was able to, thanks to the special flake that is the protagonist being with them. They travel through the wasteland that is earth, fend off zombies, and eventually find a resistance group named Right Hand. Because they are right, and are fighting the Wicked. God these lazy names are killing me. There is nothing worthy of note going on in the second movie. It ends with a cliffhanger where the evil wicked attack and kidnap the protagonist's platonic girlfriend, so he swears revenge, prepares to attack their evil base, and we are watching a corny action flick. I don't care about the third movie. These are terrible films, based on terrible books that are essentially light novels.not really any point in saying contains spoilers because i cant as this is not the movie i read the book to! i have to say being one of the people to actually read the book unlike the people who made this movie, i am very disappointed. for one why is Teresa in it? was she going to miss out on a pay check? she is supposed to be in it for like 5 minutes in a dingy house, kiss Thomas and then tell him to leave. other than that there is supposed to be the telepathy between Thomas and herself that never happens. Where are the hanging dead people on the ceiling at the first place they wake up in? where is the weird silver goo that chops their heads off? where are the monsters they have to fight? where are the pods they have to climb into? why are there all these scenes that never happen and make no sense being there? whats up with Brenda? they miss out on so much character development that you have no idea who these people are! where is the crank who is half mad and 'rose took my nose'? where the hell is the entire story??????? if you have read the books don't bother watching this. it is a BIG disappointment.The energy founders on the story. The same thing happened like in the first movie. If you look at the films individually and not compare them to the books, you get a well made post-apocalyptic teenage-fantasy- adaptation. You can enjoy the first half of the movie if you don't take everything to serious. Like in the first movie you get a lot of running, action, young enthusiasm and energy. The last is actually quite entertaining and underestimated. But both films are simply to long and the story fades away somewhere in the middle. At the end of the movie you are relieved you made it that far. They bombard you with information, emotion and so on. The running gets tiring too. You'll watch it once. You'll like the beginning due to its excitement and then you'll get bored because the story can not hold up the intensity.Please tell me this film was a space filler between sequels In summary, this film was somewhat aimless and unfocused. Perhaps I didn't read the book so I do not understand, but the whole film could have been cut in half to avoid a lot of extraneous stuff.  Action sequences were decent. Jump-scares were decent. Overall plot was alright, although it feels like the whole film was overly stretched out (a la Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies). There was also not much character chemistry to carry the story. You don't really feel for the characters as much as you did in the first installment. The first one was way better. Please lower your expectations that you had from the first one before watching this one. Do yourself a favour. 5/10Maze Runner trips up in disappointing follow-up Following their escape from the mysterious labyrinth in the first Maze Runner, we meet up with our Gladers in a facility run by WCKD- geddit(!)- who may or may not want to harvest the blood of our young adult protagonists. While the enclosed space of the Glade in the first film drew plenty of similarities to Lost- the Scorch Trials has a feel similar to The Walking Dead with the zombie-like Cranks attempting to spread the Flare virus to those still unaffected. The scenery is far more expansive than its predecessor with some excellent post-apocalyptic landscapes. In particular, buildings are seen leaning on other buildings- providing the setting for an imaginative action scene with the zombies. However, the vast majority of the run time consists of the group running away from things- Cranks, lightning strikes, noises- and this begins to tire after a while. There is very little in terms of plot development in the middle third of the film. You could skip the middle 40 minutes and it would still make as much sense. What was also disappointing is that many of the questions from the first Maze Runner remained unanswered. Clocking in at over two hours, it had plenty of time to do this. Scorch Trials is salvaged somewhat with an anarchic finale which was just about enough to retain interest for the franchise's concluding film. Giancarlo Esposito is also excellent in the first performance I have seen from him since Breaking Bad. However, while the first Maze Runner gave the franchise a solid foundation, Scorch Trials has unfortunately dropped the ball.This changed my mind! Okay - the first movie was good! It was my favourite and i loved it! When this movie came out it excited me SO much! I went to see it with my family like the last movie we did as a family - the started blew my mind, i loved it where they took it off from the last movie! Getting into the film i saw some hicups with it - where they haven't got new ideas, they have kind of copied off other movies, e.g. The Hunger Games had their own creatures and monster the battle that are a massive remake on the old creature but they had some similar things to show they created them. But it The Maze Runner 2 (This movie) they have more or less copied and not change a thing about the creatures! The story line is amazing: don't get me wrong but they didn't recreate something that say 'Here this is my amazing remake' which they needed to. So this movie did put me down a lot more than i thought it would when i started.Good Enough But Lacks The Entertainment The First Film Had I'm going to start off by using an old clich√©...this sequel is decent enough, but it's definitely not as good as the first film. I know - that's not a very original thing to say, but as with a lot of sequels, it's true. In fact, this second movie ends up being a bit of a disappointment in a way because it starts off well enough, but from about the 70-80 minute mark it just starts to drag as if it was deliberately stretched out. It's definitely a movie of two halves so to speak and it's really what happens in that first half that makes me give it the rating I did, but only just because if it carried on much longer, I think it would have dropped. The first movie had pretty much everything a good Sci-Fi Action/Thriller should have...a decent amount of good action, plenty of suspense &amp; atmosphere, an enjoyable story, and keeps you watching. This sequel starts off with pretty much all of those, but it definitely fades away in the last third. The action completely nose-dives and the story takes a bit of a ridiculous turn for me because :::::SPOILER ALERT::::: for Thomas to change his mind and want to go back to where they all started after everything they all went through is a huge WTF moment. That's a bit like Hilts in The Great Escape wanting to go back to get revenge on the Germans after he and his crew escaped from the POW camp they were in. As I said earlier, the rating I've given this film is purely because of the first two thirds...they kept it interesting with a decent amount of suspense so why deviate from what was making it an enjoyable to something you'd find in a boring slow-paced Drama was disappointing. If you've not read the books (like me) then you might quite enjoy this film generally for what it is, but if you've read the books you'll probably hate it because I've read that this film goes completely off-track from what happens in the book. Why? Well, only the film makers can tell us that. A decent enough film, but still disappointing.Mixed feelings The Scorch Trials, as a movie, is not a bad movie. It's well made, the pace is good and it's entertaining. However if you look at it as part of the series, it's not that great. There's a big difference between the book's storyline and the movie adaptation and not in a good way. In the book, The Scorch Trials, actually is a trial. In the movie it's more of a renegade story. Because of that the movie doesn't make as much sense as The Maze Runner when it comes to storytelling. In The Maze Runner it all made sense because the whole setup was being explained to you as you were watching and the end was logical as the end of the movie coincided with the end of the first trial. In The Scorch Trials there is none of that. Because the storyline changed so much the logic is gone, they don't do a very good job explaining it and the end is vague at best.The Movies Have TOO Many Questions? Some people said that The Maze Runner and The Scorch Trials both had so many questions and unfortunately, we didn't get the answer (what they got? more questions!) But, in my opinion, this movie is, well, great. I do get the 'thriller feels'. Especially when the cranks were chasing them. I scream once (don't laugh at me!) Even so, I do had many questions and still don't have the answer. But I won't complain now. Why? Because they still have the third film, that means they still have ! chance to answer our question. And if they don't? Well, a little SPOILER, the books Maze Runner Trilogy (still) don't have any answer for our questions, really. James Dashner, the writer, still didn't give any answers. The third and fourth books also gave us more and more questions instead answering our questions. Can I kill Dashner now? Wait, I can't! WHY? Because.... *GOOD NEWS EVERYBODY* Dashner, our lovely-and-killable writer had announce that there will be the FIFTH BOOK!! (check my wallet *OH GOD DAMN YOU DASHNER*) He had finished the book and it will be revealed soon! yap! It said that the fifth book, "The Maze Code", is (kinda) journal from the glade-rs. Well, I am expecting that there will be Paige's journal too, cs it will certainly answer all the questions about WICKED, right? So, wait for the third movie and the fifth book, guys! (Please don't disappoint me..) And if you are wondering am I gonna buy the fifth book, I said I won't for now. I still mad because Dashner made Thomas killed Newt in the third book (OOPS, BIG SPOILER). I want to cry. #WeWONT!TalkAboutPage250# I am not ready to read Newt's journal, after what happened to him. *I JUST LIKE: GOD, WHY?!* Well, I guess enough with this long and full-of-spoiler review. I won't discuss about the movies difference compared to the books, because it will make this review WAY TO LONG to read (and I have some things to do right now). So, bye! P.S. This is my first review HAHA! and P.P.S. I AM bad for grammar, so sorry if there's any mistake(s) :D and last, P.P.P.S. English is not my national's language, and well, I'm not really used to this, ha ha, so sorry!Through with the Maze, but still running Haven't read the book(s), so pointing that out from the start, because I read some really angry reviews by people who have read it. There's people out there who hate the filmmakers/writers of this, because they soiled on the book and made it something they didn't want to see. Can't comment on that only on how the movie felt. And it felt kinda freeing (no pun intended) to some regard. Especially after leaving the one location plot from the first movie. A lot of new characters get introduced and some nice actors join in on the act. Whether you like it or not will depend on if you know where this is going. It's going actually pretty dark and I didn't expect to see those "creatures" to be honest. The effects are more than decent and the movie has a nice pace to it (15 minutes of outtakes was a bit excessive though, on the disc, but you can tell they had fun making the movie)Transitional stage... "Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials" is the sequel of "The Maze Runner" and it continues from the point that the Gladers escaped from the maze. After their escape they face another obstacles and difficulties in a very hostile environment. I have to admit that my expectations about this movie was higher than the first one and that was my mistake. Apparently this movie is as I wrote in my title just a transitional stage that guides us to the third movie. This movie consists with a lot of new information that makes it a little bit boring. This has as a result the action scenes of it to seem not as good as it is. The direction of this movie was made by Wes Ball as in the first one. Dylan O'Brien did his best for this movie one more time but this time his interpretation was not enough.  Lastly I believe that "Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials" is not a bad movie but eventually when it is compared with the first one then its quality is lower. The best thing that you have to do is to be prepared and do not have high expectations from this movie.Chappy Watched: Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials I don't know if it's just here in Australia but I feel that this movie has gone under the radar. Trailers only started airing about a week before the movie was released but other than that, no other press or advertising like that seemed to be released. Like the first movie, I really enjoyed this film. It picks up straight from the ending of the first film; complete with a cast that doesn't look they have aged since filming The Maze Runner. All the sets and the scenic views are awesome, it looks futuristic without throwing it in our faces as is the apocalyptic look of the film. Dylan O'Brien is still the stand out of this film and if even possible, is even better than he was in the previous film and handles leading the film and all the action and drama really well. Aside from O'Brien, the cast is pretty awesome including both previous stars (Ki Hong Lee, Dexter Darden, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Alexander Flores) and new additions (Lili Taylor, Barry Pepper, Giancarlo Esposito, Jacob Lofland and Rosa Salazar). I still don't feel any chemistry between Thomas (O'Brien) and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario); I felt more chemistry between Thomas and Brenda (Salazar) and I'm hopefully optimistic that Thomas and Teresa won't end up together in the end. Aside from WCKD, we get a looks at some new baddies working against them including zombies and even for a chunk of the film, the weather. Given some of the things that happen towards the end, I am now eagerly awaiting the third film. Just a whole two years to go! Will be going to see it again and will be a Day 1 purchase when it's released to own. CHAPPY THINKS that he doesn't want to wait until 2017 until the third movie comes out!While the pace is high and the action scenes impressive, the storyline is weak and the mystery mediocre After Thomas and the other 'Gladers' have survived the Maze and its dangers, they are taken to a gigantic complex with other boys and girls. Every now and then a number of teens is selected to move to a 'better environment'. After the hostile Maze, everyone thinks they are save, but Thomas distrust the whole situation. With help of the boy Aris he finds out they are housed at the mysterious organisation WCKD, who is into some strange business. Thomas and the other familiar character decide to escape. Their quest to safety and answers leads to a grueling journey through the Scorch, a desert with the remains of the city of New York, and other strange figures. The Scorch Trials is the second part in The Maze Runner franchise and adaptation of the novel written by James Dashner. Returning to the sequel is director Wes Ball, who has once again delivered an action-packed sci-fi film, and the complete cast. Dylan O'Brien, Ki Hong Lee, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden and Alexander Flores are back in their respectively roles of Thomas, Minho, Teresa, Newt, Frypan and Winston. Unfortunately, the character are quite flat and there aren't any character developments. This is party because the main character Thomas, gets too much screen time compared to the others. Teresa might cause a stir which means an unexpected turn of events, the other members of the original group have little to no input. Luckily, the group is joined by new faces very quickly. A boy in the complex who asks Thomas for his help, is called Aris and is played by Jacob Lofland. Of all people, Aris is there the longest and shares his concerns with Thomas. After their escape the group meet Brenda (Rosa Salazar), Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) and a group of resistance fighters. Brenda and Jorge could have been interesting characters if they got more screen time. On the mysterious and questionable side, we meet Janson. He is the one who has the control over the complex and is into some strange affairs. During the first thirty minutes it gets explored what Janson is doing and from that moment it is the group's priority to escape from Janson. Janson is played by the man who many of us know by the name Peter 'Littlefinger' Baelish, the insidious character from TV-series Game of Thrones. In other words Aiden Gillen. With this information, Gillen is perfect for the part of Janson. From the moment we meet him, it's clear Janson is up to something and is definitely not someone you can trust! However, after Thomas and his friends escape we only see Janson from a helicopter screaming orders. It was better and more interesting if this character was more deepened. He looks like a simple follower with no own ideas or opinion and leadership. His big boss is Patricia Clarkson's character Ava Paire, the doctor who did or did not die in the previous film. Paige certainly is an interesting character and has the answers to many questions, unfortunately we see too little of her and if she does enters the picture she is not of great value. The storyline is less strong, and the mystery is also significantly less. Like I mentioned before, the first thirty minutes of the film is the only moment when some questions are answered. The kids in the complex are used for the greater good: extract blood to create a cure and defeat the zombie-virus. However, it is wise to watch The Maze Runner before The Scorch Trials. The mysteries of that film which got answered, are not talked about again, which makes it sometimes vague. All though this only counts for the beginning, since there is not much too guess in this film and there is few new information. After the escape we mainly see the characters run and stay out of Janson's hands. The Scorch looks amazing, you can even see the remains of the Brooklyn Bridge and their first shelter resembles an old and dilapidated warehouse. The trip through the desert is besides an upcoming thunderstorm, less intimidating. The best aspect of the film is the action. The visual effects are amazing and the Cranks, zombies, look pretty scary. There even are a couple of jump scare moments. Moreover, the pace of the film is just like its predecessor quite high. Therefore, the film makes you sit on the edge of your seat and is never boring. To conclude, the second part in The Maze Runner series is very entertaining. The pace of The Scorch Trails is high and therefore the film gets never boring nor will you lose interest. The action scenes are well made and the special effects make the action look even better and more impressive. Unfortunately, these are the film's best assets. The storyline is weaker and the mystery, which was so strong in the first part, is pretty mediocre. There's not much to guess and the film is a lot about running for Janson and the organisation WCKD. Dylan O'Brien's character carries the film and he makes a good impression. However, he gets so much screen time which draws the attention of the other characters, old and new, who are therefore less interesting.Killed A Dull Rainy Afternoon For Me, No problem. I haven't read the books. I only watched these movies after exhausting everything else, but contrary to many reviews on here, I was entertained throughout. There isn't of a lot of originality in the concept but then there wasn't in the first movie either, which was a 3-way mash-up of The Hunger Games Vs. The Village Vs. Lord of the Flies, but it had a lot of heart from a first time director with something to prove on a 'low' budget and The Scorch Trials is more of the same in that respect, albeit with double the budget of the first. *Isn't it ironic that we live in the midst of a global economic crisis yet $30m is considered 'low budget' for a movie?* Politics aside, What gives this series as an edge is the energy from director Wes Ball and the cast, who give depth and instant likability to the characters, somewhat lacking in other YA films. The core fan-base is obviously annoyed that this movie deviated wildly and I understand that completely, I would be too, but as an action/thriller sequel, and separate to the books, there are a lot worse ways to spend a cold, wet, winter day.The adventure expands outside the maze to seek the answers. Another teen movie in the mid series on the line of 'Divergent' and 'Hunger Games'. As an adult, I don't know what to expect from it, but entertainment was the priority. The first film was just an introduction that happened in a small and a single location like the film 'Cube'. Now it has outspread in a large extent with more new characters and takes a wider adventure in the wastelands. Many doubts from the previous film were cleared, yet a few need to be clarified and hoping for the next one to do that job. But anyway the suspense was this franchise's specialty, that simply reminds us the TV series 'Lost'. This second part can be compared with plenty of other post apocalyptic films, but still I liked it better than the first. The best thing was they retained the same director and he's going to be here for the next film as well. But I'm more interested in the prequel, I mean the fourth film than the third which brings an end to the story moving forward. Because the maze holds the key for many unresolved issues. So I'm anticipating the prequel trilogy than the current one to learn how it all began. Surprisingly, many new additions like zombies, bounty hunters in the mainstream boosted the film with its variety. Gives us a creepy atmosphere, along thrilling running and chasing. The twist was not that great, but kind of unpredictable, and again due to the mysteries surrounding it, it created more curious about what might happen next. 6¬Ω/10One story recycled three times I had not read the books, but fairly enjoyed the first movie. This one is ridiculous in that there are three consecutive stories that play out exactly the same way. They get caught. The people catching them turn out to be the exact opposite of what they originally think. They escape. Thomas says "Go, go, go, go, go!" Someone gets hurt. Someone else says "Are you OK?" He feels guilty. He decides he has to go back to rescue someone. This plays out in exactly this order three times. One would think not to reuse one of the dumbest things in Jurassic Park 2. Getting up on your hands and knees, and finally just your feet, on breaking glass is the stupidest thing you can do.Fast-paced action-packed The Scorch Trials was very different than the books, and as a fan of the books this could have been a bad thing. Not in this case. The book was clearly his own thing, just like the movie is. You do have the same story and characters, they are just dealing with the story in a different way, a way that is probably better when you wanne do it justice in only 2 hours. Before watching it, I think it's important that you watched the first movie or else you'll be completely lost about what exactly is going on. But it's such a roller-coaster. The action is faced-paced and looks very spectacular. There are a few run and fight scenes that are dealt with in such a strong way that it had me jumping up and down in my seat. I can't stress enough by writing how much I enjoyed this movie. And most of that has to do with the incredible cast. The writers were able to put in a few heartfelt moments in there so that we don't lose touch with the human side of it all. And the acting helped elevate those moments. It's beyond me why IMDb has such a low rating for this movie. It was an entertaining popcorn movie and I can't wait for the last part.Starts off OK.....barely OK....not OK Like the first Maze Runner this one was an average movie...if the last 30mins did not bore me.. The movie starts off great and goes into action real fast, but as the movie progresses it loses its sweetness and goes into bad taste and slowly into no taste at all... The end was very nicely put together and makes you really happy for the next one, but again if this one wasn't really good than why should the people trust on the new one.. In the end the movie is watchable and since I have read the book as well I can tell you that the thired one has an amazing story and even though this one wasn't that good you should still good and watch it.Hope is a dangerous thing I talk about plot, make comparisons, and may be considered to be spoilers. As being the guy who hasn't read the books, I was glad to see this one answer questions left unanswered...and I am still unsure why they were put into the maze only to take them out if their immune system enzymes are the big picture. It seems the earth was destroyed by scorch or something and a zombie virus called "flare" had infected the general population as the WCKD look for a cure, that for some reason can never be synthesized, reproduced, etc. We have a typical post apocalyptic society with destroyed landmarks, zombies, and pockets of people living in remote areas. I personally liked the version where Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) was played by Milla Jojovich. But hey, that's just me. It excites me more for a supermodel to save the world than a bunch of teens. Action, shooting, killing, and zombies. Is it me or is Dylan O'Brien's character and acting on the stiff side? No F-bombs, sex or nudity.Hey! I actually still like this decent little YA franchise! Sure, it needs some color and humor, but it's got solid performances and unexpectedly strong visual direction to support the post-apocalyptic adventure writing. Easily the best of the teen film series'...outside of the big ones of course (HP, HG).Loved it Good effects, scary but good plot, and very suspenseful. Acting was good and interesting thoughts in movie.Not nearly as engaging as The Maze Runner, but above all a decent enough sequel Since The Maze Runner: The Death Cure came out two weeks ago, I'm going to review the second installment of The Maze Runner franchise that started with the first one. The original Maze Runner deviated from the young-adult romance trope that plagued the recent adaptations after Twilight ended and it received mixed-to-positive reviews. While fans of the book series either hated it or found it ok, it was considered by many to be a much better young-adult adaptation. It had mystery, it had thrills, it had action and it had emotion. People liked it and so did I. Then, a year later back in 2015, I saw the sequel hoping it would live up to the first film, but while it was a decent enough sequel, it did disappoint me and I understand the mixed reaction from both critics and fans of the second book "The Scorch Trials". There are some positives that worked in the film. The cinematography is really gorgeous including the buildings and the actual desert, not to mention it's solid make-up and CGI effects on the Cranks. 61 million dollars went into the production and much like the first film, it was well spent. John Paesano, who scored the first film, did another solid job in delivering the same stuff he did from the atmosphere to the action music. Wes Ball, who directed the first film, delivered another top-notch direction. Also, the acting continues to be great with Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden, Alexander Flores, Ki Hong Lee, and Patricia Clarkson continuing to deliver excellent performances as did the new supporting cast including Giancarlo Esposito, Alan Tudyk, Rosa Salazar, and Aidan Gillen as the Rat Man, Jorge, and Brenda. And then, there's the action sequences which are more intense and action-packed including the chase scenes. Those set pieces alone are worth watching if anyone else checks the movie out on DVD. That being said, there are some drawbacks that disappointed those who loved the first film and the book series. First, there's the writing, which sadly does feel a bit weak and borrows sources from other zombie-genre related stuff. Not only that, it deviated from the second book despite having some bits of elements which caused an outrage to fans. Also, while the film delivered on the action and thrills, it lacked the mystery and emotion that made the first film work. Not to mention the plot and character development were severely lacking. The new characters were well introduced, but no depth was given to them. Then, there's the pacing which is sadly another weak element to the film. I don't mind two hour films but only when they have development for the characters. The original film had brisk pacing and took it's time for Thomas to interact with the other Gladers and becoming a really great leader and those characters were the ones you cared about. There's some of it here but not enough considering the weak writing and it's deviation from the source material. Overall, The Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is a decent enough sequel and it delivered what it promised in the trailers, but sadly, it wasn't nearly as engaging as the first film. I haven't seen The Death Cure yet, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed it would be an improvement. 3/5So, so, so wrong For a long time I didn't want to read the books but I did watch the movies. At that time I thought this movie was amazing and then I read the book.  Oh my word, I love this cast because they are pretty freaking awesome, but they really, really, really went off book. I mean the main plot is the same however 99/100 things that happened in this movie are incorrect. If this is your first time seeing it and you haven't read the book just assume that everything you're watching is incorrect, because it probably is. The Cranks are overdramatized, the whole rebel gang in the desert thing NEVER HAPPENED and Teresa was pretty much NEVER there. And Rat Man, whom I love, doesn't look like Rat Man!!!!!! Plus the whole "their blood is the cure" thing is sooo incorrect, because the Flare infects your brain like cancer or a mental illness, which then has residual effects on the body. So to take their blood would do nothing to fight the Flare.  On the other hand the movie is entertaining to watch, if you are not watching it for the story. Therefore I would give it a 7 based on how entertaining it was and a 2 for how inaccurate it was. I do have to say that based on this movie I don't think the next one, the Death Cure, is even worth seeing. If this one was so inaccurate the Death Cure will most likely be much, much worse.One of the Best Films of 2015 My opinion might be a little biased cause I'm a huge fan of the Utopian and Ethiopian genre. But this movie definitely exceeded my expectations. It definitely trumps divergent by far, might even be on par with the hunger games. This movie was non stop action, and mystery. It definitely succeeded in keeping me on edge wondering what was going to happen next. If you're contemplating whether or not you should watch it, do yourself a favor and watch it, believe me you will not regret it! I cannot wait until the sequel comes out! Great stuff! Well that's about it for what I have to say, you've gotta watch the movie to really understand the good things about it. The movie Is good.Spared by Momentum The Maze Runner worked because it realizes the obstacles of its titular maze pretty well, even though much of the storyline hardly makes sense. There is a hint of a non-conformist commentary behind the ordeal of escaping the "Glade", but lead to a twist that makes it quite complicated. This sequel is supposed to unravel much of those questions and surprisingly, it's actually introducing more worlds, characters and questions that makes the narrative even more complicated. But just like the first one, it's the action that outshine every mess in the story. Many might be dazzled by this gloss, but the story deserves more clarity to be considered as a good sequel. It takes a lot of time for the heroes to find out the truth behind their enemy that we already knew from the first one, and yet the film doesn't quite establish much of its characters, even the new one who just joined their journey. And once they're on to their actual quest of finding resistance, they do not have a definite destination, which can be understandable, giving a suspense of doubt for their survival, but that is actually what most of the film is, apparently. It's fine if the movie is all mystery, but it's not an impressive ambiguous experience if the story still bringing more information that keeps their journey even longer and less simple. Every moment they stop by after an action scene, they mention a place that is supposed to be refuge, then it introduces another character to give more exposition and then they reveal another twist and turn. It could be the film's way of saying that they have a rich universe and it keeps expanding every time they spill more exposition, but mostly, this felt repetitive. It is supposed to be some disorienting phenomena that you may experience in a mind bending film, but that doesn't seem to be the film's intention. They're just saving too much surprise and that makes the experience exasperating. A great excuse for this issue is to at least develop any of these characters. So far, it's still Thomas who has more characterization among the others. Teresa has some development at some point, but she is still stick in the mud like everyone else. And there's also a new character who had a crucial purpose at the beginning then suddenly becomes a ghost at the middle where we hardly notice he was still with the crew until the plot once again needed him. And then we keep getting introduced with new characters. Only the older cast can be bring the real pizazz since most of them embraces the villainy or the over-the-top nature of their roles. The serious redeeming factor here is director Wes Ball. Without the maze, the action is a little less snazzy; we instead get deserts, thunder and even zombies, but those were handled well. This in fact could be worth seeing for these action scenes alone. Again, in an age of over-CGI-ed spectacles, this is one of those where the action is truly defined by tension and velocity than just some impressive explosion or creature effect. And even the horror-movie-like-aesthetics remain, passionate about showing the terror of these creatures and the probability of losing any major character (if only they are well developed, but still effective in suspense, anyway.) Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is fun, but not by much. The plot is just too complicated to follow and the director really tries so hard to make something interesting out of it. Fortunately, he did, but the flaws are still inevitable. There is still so much questions left unanswered and it gets even more exasperating for leaving more secrets unraveled. Maybe the characters aren't much of a big deal since their plights were at least clear, but what. In a brighter side, in spite that this is a new environment, the film still manages to bring something cool and exciting through these worlds. It might be cooler as a video game or just a cinematic ride. The Scorch Trials is much of the same, except there is so much to keep in mind until the next installment comes next year.Running aimlessly to nowhere "You can't survive the scorch."  Walking into the cinema... Are dystopian young adult dramas running out of steam? Overall rating: 2 stars Cinematic value: 2 stars Big questions value: 2 stars For those keeping up with the latest in young adult dystopian fiction, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials continues the saga of Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and his fellow Gladers. They have escaped the Maze, but it is an 'out of the frying pan and into the Scorch' experience. They leave their dystopian Garden of Eden existence and find themselves at a transfer depot facility that is overseen by Jansen (Aiden Gilen). He claims to be helping the 'immunes' of society to get to a safe place that is far from the barren wasteland called The Scorch. Thomas' band of brothers and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) have to determine if the outpost is designed to set them free or to keep them captive. On top of these internal trials, after their recent maze exodus they also need to investigate the purpose of the mysterious organisation called WCKD and how Janson's outfit is involved. Their haphazard search for the truth involves a multitude of other human outposts where they run into the hands of organised crime gangs, infected zombie-like creatures and The Right Arm resistance fighters, all in an attempt to stay ahead of WCKD's special forces. Director Wes Ball (The Maze Runner) managed to deliver a fresh spin on the disquieting young-adult genre with his first instalment and developed an intriguing cinematic puzzle. Unfortunately, this relatively new director has fallen into the trap of the sophomore venture. Given the task of following up to his original creation, he has to try and make lightning strike twice. In this second outing, he struggles to determine what type of film he is trying to make. Is it The Hunger Games, is it World War Z, or is it Alien? Understandably, sampling from other filmmakers is not new for directors, but Ball seems to be get lost within the tangled web he attempts to spin. Early in the film Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) asks Thomas if he has a plan for their escape and the leader has no solid answer. The same can be said of Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials, there does not seem to be any concrete direction for the story.  From the first chapter to the second, the producers invested in a multitude of special effects, but seemed to have left the script writer back in the maze of the first episode. The script becomes a series of derivative lines that only serve as trivial connectors between the numerous running sequences. One appealing factor of The Maze Runner was the development of the key characters, which helped the audience to develop concern for their well being. In this venture, most of the misguided disciples of Thomas serve one of two purposes, either as hopeless running companions or the victims of the various horrors along the way. There is a richness to the visual effects journey, but the The Scorch Trials lacks much character development. Understandably with trilogies, the second link in the chain is meant to connect the series together, leaving key plot points open for the conclusion to answer, but it helps if the audience cares about the central players. The challenge in getting people to the final instalment of this trilogy will be to provide a reason for caring for this group of misfits, because the second chapter does not provide this key story element. Leaving open the question, should we care if the society of Maze Runner even survives?  Taking a moment to catch a breath from all of the athletic activity, this film does have one underlying theme that is worth pondering. Thomas and the others must risk their own lives to save the remnant of society. Yet, with their best intentions, they are caught in the cross-fire of forces that seem to be attempting the same goal, saving the lives of the world's population. In trying to save the earth, is the fate of society worth the sacrifice of a a few? Throughout the film, the lines are blurred in answering the question of the sanctity of life. It is not an easy answer, but does beg the questions the value of life and to what lengths must we go to preserve others lives? God proves throughout the Bible the lengths he will go to to save people's lives, but people need to determine if they are willing to accept his answer to life.  Leaving the cinema... One puzzling factor in the majority of the end of the world and dystopian style films in the past few years is they all happen in San Francisco. It is an exceptionally iconic city that is known for the engineering marvel, the Golden Gate Bridge. Yet, as a bridging film, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is far from iconic and definitely is not a cinematic marvel.  Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. How will the world come to an end? (Matthew, 24:36, Revelation 20:1-15) 2. What does the Bible say about the sanctity of life? (Genesis 1:27, Psalm 139: 13-16, Matthew 5:21-22) 3. What sacrifice does God make to save mankind? (Luke 23-24) Discussion questions sheet: Use the attached discussion guides.

I loved every second of it, along with every other fan in the theater. Is it different from the book? Yes. It's very different at times, but Wes took the best from the book and added it into the movie, along with filling in the blanks with terrifying Cranks and the relentlessness of WCKD. I don't doubt that this movie will perform better than the first, if anything, it'll blow up. The movie did not seem to have any faults from my eyes, and if anything, answered several questions that the first left unanswered. The ending is different from the book, though I fully trust Wes to wrap this series on a high note. I could not have asked for a better sequel in this already amazing series.The worst film I have seen in years I'm almost at a loss for words. I stayed the whole way through the movie thinking "it can only get better from here" and I was wrong. I am an ardent science fiction fan and really enjoy movies set in a dystopian society, but certainly not this one. Nowhere near as gripping as Mad Max Fury Road, no pulling of the heart strings such as in The Hunger Games and no plot surprises such as in Ender's Game. There are some good actors in the movie and I feel sorry for them. Poor Aidan Gillen - from GOT to this. The silk purses and sows ear proverb come to mind as I do not think it was possible to redeem this movie no matter how good the acting could have been. You can pick the plot from only a few minutes into the film , so no surprises there. The jerky POV action scenes makes them unwatchable and that was, in some ways, a relief from the tedium of the rest of the movie. Go. watch it for yourself: it will at least make all the other awful films you have seen look better by comparison.It's really a great movie! but. ***might have spoilers*** For me, The Scorch Trials really slammed the Divergent/Insurgent. This movie really exceeded my Expectations, and I'm sure it will exceed yours to. At some points from the beginning, there are little tiny bit of disappointments I have felt, but, I realized later that, that disappointments are nonsense! 'cause in the end it was a very good movie. The movie will make your jaws hang open, It's full of non-stop action and thrilling scenes that'll make you say, "oh, I think I haven't breathed for minutes". It's full of mysteries and suspense, they might give you goose bumps if you have read the book before watching the film. well, this is just my opinion. It was never boring, and it has a big cliffhangers. If you're doubting if you gonna watch it or not. you should watch it! It'll make your head full of mixed emotions. Believe me, This is a really great movie. go find its greatness yourself. But there's only one thing that really bugs me, the connection of the movie's title to the events. it's more like, the characters chose what they wanted to do and face the consequences, than WCKD gave trials to test them. Anyways, It's really a good movie. I can't wait to see "The Death Cure". P.S. don't mind the metascore!I liked it more than Part 1, but not everybody will... OK, so I found Scorch Trials exciting and more complete as a movie. It also had a better cliffhanger in my opinion, because I felt like I needed to watch the next part NOW. Whereas for the ending of Maze Runner, I was like... "Here we go again???" For sure... part 2 did not have the novelty of part 1, and for that reason alone some people might give a lower score. In fact, this movie felt more like a zombie survival movie with long screen time in darkness, jumpscares and all, so this is another reason some fans of the first part might not like Scorch Trials. It has a darker atmosphere. It also has many clich√© moments, and scenes taken right out from other movies like Jurassic park. Unoriginal ideas, but well, they worked OK in this movie. As for the acting, I liked it. I thought everyone did a pretty compelling job. I liked the twist at the end, which unlike in many movies, doesn't feel forced. All in all, Scorch Trials is a very different movie from the first. Different settings, different environment, different atmosphere. Once again, it did not have the novelty and originality the first part had. But with that said, I can't say it wasn't exciting and entertaining, and made me look forward to the next part.Continuing blandness THE SCORCH TRIALS is the second film in the MAZE RUNNER series, a series which is already outstaying its welcome thanks to the over-familiarity of the material which gives it a cookie-cutter feel. The kids from the last film have survived and escaped into a new world which turns out to be just as deadly as the last one. Expect the usual gamut of bland characterisation, an over-reliance on CGI to provide all of the landscape and action shots, and predictable twists and turns in the narrative. I enjoyed Aidan Gillen's presence here but that's about it. This is the kind of film that slips from my memory just moments after the credits roll, and the kind of film that I'll never have any interest in returning to - especially when there's so much better stuff out there.action packed sequel Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and the rest of the Gladers are welcomed by Janson (Aidan Gillen) who claims to be the opposition to WiCKD. There are more young people from other Mazes. Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) gets separated from the boys. Maze runner Aris reveals the disturbing situation to Thomas. Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) is actually in charge and draining something from the young people. Thomas leads the guys to rescue Teresa and escape into the Scorch outside. They go in search for the rebels Right Arm. Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) and his group including charge Brenda take the group captive. This sequel to 'The Maze Runner' is filled with action. The start is not the best. Janson should gather the group and explain the world even if he injects some lies about himself. The exposition would help reconnect passing fans with the material. This world does not always make sense. The boys are too trusting which doesn't make sense. There are some solid action especially escaping from the zombie-like Crank. Climbing up the apocalyptic staircase is loads of fun. Wicked is not a good evil corp name. This movie makes the best of the flawed YA material.Movie is nowhere near where the Book was Headed The movie strayed so far from the book that someone can come out and actually make a new movie for this book in the Maze Runner Series. There were only 2 groups of kids in the base not many from different mazes. And Aris and Teresa get put with their respective genders to fight through the Scorch, which is a huge desert wasteland and yes they did head to the mountains but my goodness where is the book and movie cross over? Only the characters names basically resemble whats going on and the party that Thomas and Brenda go to. I don't recommend seeing this movie if you hope it is based of the book but if you want an action packed thriller full of twists and turns then sure.Better than the first This is not a disappointing sequel for me, I haven't read the books so I can judge the film on it's own. While the first movie needed to explain more things and spent a lot of time on what the maze is about, this one shows some facets of other places. Because the main characters were already described in the first part, most of the film shows either chasing, capturing or attacking, but it does those things well. It's pretty much an action film and one that looks good. It's not brilliant, but neither are the Hunger Games or the Divergent series. It's aimed at a teen audience. And yet, the surrounding world is much more interesting in the Maze Runner series. I found this film entertaining from beginning to end and it had some nice twists.One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Scorch Trials has to be one of the weakest sci-fi, seemingly low budget, and worst movies I have ever seen. DO NOT PAY A DIME to see it. Wait. Wait. Wait, until it is on TV for free. (It won't be long.) From the mish-mash plot that is a combo of too numerous science fiction movies to describe here, which in this movie don't even come close to making sense, to the lowest of low budgets with virtually 1960's special effects that last no more than 5 minutes, this movie is a loser. If you like science fiction, like I do, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH!!!!!!!! However, this movie could win an Oscar, if they give one for seemingly lowest budget films of the year. Over an hour of the movie is watching kids running through corridors being chased by somebody or some-use- to -be bodies. They must have used some old factory building and wrote graffiti on the walls, used spot lighting and then playing eerie music filmed these kids running around. And they run. And run. Then they run. They run into virus infected "Walking Dead" zombies. (I guess that somehow this movie is a sequel to "I Am Legend." Will Smith must have never developed that antidote. Or perhaps they were "Revers" from "Serenity.") What in the world did they spend $63 million on to film this garbage? Was the factory they used in down town LA or a beach front property owned by the producer's brother? Plot: Plot? What plot? One would expect that in this movie we would find out the purpose of the first movie ("Maze Runner") and why the Immunes, who are every bodies Saviors, were being killed by the bad people, who want them alive and don't want them to fall into the hands of the bad people, who are really good people, who no one is certain exist. Until they find them in a remote land far away from the bad "Wicked" people who just happen to show up to recapture the Immunes for the next low budget sci-fi piece of trash. The only movie worst than this movie I have ever seen is "Zulu Dawn."ummm... what was that? This is not a bad movie. It has some action, some love triangle(-ish stuff), minor characters that could be great if had the chance to be.But this is not a book adaptation. This has NOTHING to do with the book, therefore it was a huge, huge disappointment for me because the book is more than good. But the movie? The movie is a lie, to be honest.  I don't even know where to begin. Everything is changed. Just one - important - example: Scorch Trials, this is the title. In the book, it IS a trial. In the movie? You can only guess what they meant when they named it "trial". It's a completely different story than the book, and by different I mean worse. I can't even imagine how are they going to close it because it's... It's just not the story I read. Many essential things were missing that made the book creepy, exciting, unique and unforgettable. Action scenes were simply erased or turned into boring clish√©. The feeling of a thrill was totally gone. The characters became flat, and the conversations were all like "GO GO GO" or "WATCH OUT" or "What is your plan, Thomas?" That's it. That's the movie.  If I would be the writer of the original books, I would be furious.Just one word First movie was interesting but this one is; Clich√©..!! Same apocalyptic disease scenario, same walking dead scenes, classic action scenes and all clich√©s are in this movie. I mean desert scene and collapsed bridge what a creative idea..! and "-no this is wrong girl" Teresa, "oh my god no water again cause is desert ", "is this guys are good?" , "oh no, they wanna use us for themselves like a life insurance" There is no creative anything I mean "broken glass scene" come on guys. finally Teresa's mother story and helicopters are really good night kiss for all watchers. Total Disappointment.The movie was a crime I have read the book, and i saw forward to se the movie. But after 10 minuts i was terrified. Whats next, whats next to ruin? The movie uses some of the book materias, but it all comes out wrong. Please, don't use the title of the book for the next movie, its so wrong. Sorry for the spelling, not from UK or US, but my messege, it this; If you have read the book, don't look at this movie, it so wrong, so wrong. The director have made a completely athoer movie. I have read the book, so i compare the movie all the time, thats why my grade i so low. If you not have rad the book, the are so many questions and facts that just goes by.As good as a movie version could be I've come to realize that when watching the movie of a book you have to expect things to change. A movie can not be the exact same as a novel, they must manipulate an entire novel to meet the standards of movie timing and still keep it interesting to the viewer. I believe the cast and crew of the maze runner did so effectively and although it may not be a play-by-play of the book it will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. It will have you hooked and waiting for the last movie of the trilogy (The death cure) which may be coming to theatres in 2017. If you do not feel like waiting all that time and have not read the books yet I'd highly recommend you do so.So in a torn, deadly and resource-less world, Minho' s hair remains perfectly styled with gel. Haven't read any of the books disclaimer*  So I was quite surprised when I watched the first maze runner film because I assumed it would be terrible, gave it a try and thought "that was alright actually!". I sat down to watch the second one and assumed there would be some similarities between the films in terms of the story line ( a maze for example). NO MAZE! repeat NO MAZE. So let's recap there is no maze. Did I mention no maze? So you may be thinking "so what, the maze was the only point of the first film, there's so much more to this story". I am afraid your wrong! The maze was the BEST PART! The suspense and curiosity about what was in the maze! The first film did have other great points - the slow developing relationships between the characters, the unknown electronic/biological creatures that cause illness, the formation of groups with insiders and outsiders. This film had none of that! And barely any plot! The acting was poor bar a couple.  And what really gets on my nerves is that Minho's hair is always perfectly styled. Oh please At least make things realistic!Scorch Trials I haven't read the books so I only form my opinion based on the movies.  You can't watch this sequel without seeing the first one - The Maze Runner. There are no flashbacks to the previous movie, no montage that sums it up and the story picks up right where it left off. Also it mentions characters and events from it. Thomas is the POV character in this one too, also the leader and the only character who has any personality. Fortunately he's played by Dylan O'Brian who gives a great performance. We don't really get to know the boys or Teresa any better since they're still suffering from memory loss and that gives the creators a nice loophole to not do any character development. Most of the movie takes place in a giant desert, some post apocalyptic city full of wrecked skyscrapers. It's photographed beautifully by Gyula Pados.  Despite the title there is no trial in this installment, instead they're constantly on the run from WCKD. The company that was depicted evil in the first movie, now things are not simply black and white and maybe trying to find a cure for the virus really is the most important thing. The whole plot consists of the Gladers trying to find the rebellion so they can stop WCKD. Along the way they find new allies and some new type of infected people who look like zombies.  Even though they're constantly on the run there is no sense of urgency. That's the most glaring error of the movie along with not being able to stand on its own. You can watch the Maze Runner then stop and it's still makes a complete experience. It's kind of like the Matrix trilogy in this way, but at least there the creators told that part 2 and 3 are one movie just split apart. In the Scorch Trials you think that you're gonna get answers or at least be able to ask more questions but there's no such thing here, the whole movie feels like a stopgap for the third one.  I only recommend to watch this if you're a fan of the young stars, especially Dylan O'Brien and Rosa Salazar. Giancarlo Esposito and Alan Tudyk only have brief roles.It had the opportunity to be great. Everything was set-up perfectly for this to be a great sequel. Parts of the movie actually lived up to it, but only in small segments of visual stunning and little developments in the story that we were hoping for. I find the weaknesses of the movie were very partially around the casting, but more so around the conversations and story-telling of the writers for this movie. I gave it a 6, because despite how horrendous the writing was, the rest of the movie was quite well directed and still enjoyable to watch. It was almost enough to ignore the main issues with the movie. I'm quite certain there was a big meeting with the upper management of this film after seeing the turnout upon release, and they will address all these issues properly for the third installment.I was so excited for this movie D: I have read the book over a year ago so I didn't remember much, but I was sure the movie would remind me of what happened in the novel, as all the Harry Potter movies did for example. This wasn't the case though.  Right from the beginning I was very confused and every now and then I just frowned at the computer screen thinking, wait, this is not how it went down in the book... wait, no, this didn't happen at all... oh, right, wasn't THIS supposed to happen? Oh and WHEN will THAT COOL THING HAPPEN I can't wait to see how they made it look on the screen! But no.  Took almost until the end of the movie to realize that the director decided to take the book only as a loose suggestion of the plot and then just take it somewhere else completely.  So, I don't know. It's not completely terrible, it's just not what the Maze Runner series was. At all. I was very disappointed. I guess usually, with book adaptations, people actually want to see the stuff that happened in the book. Or at least most of it. Or at least some of it. But oh well.  Giving it a four stars because despite all of this, the movie itself was quite enjoyable.Exciting, confused and different What, what? I'm sorry... zombies? Within the first five minutes of The Scorch Trials we are thrown for a confusing and ever changing gambit of what is popular today with what is happening in the plot. In the end of the first Maze Runner film we are told the world was destroyed by an epic disease and that which the world as we know it has been trying to find a cure. We are told that these boys (and girl) are our last resort in finding a cure and their trials that they have been facing will all be explained as they help find a cure and solution for this deadly virus. A deadly virus which turns out to be something that you'd expect to see on The Walking Dead. And the corporation that has been putting these young adults through their trials is just a fascist regime looking to save their own skin.  I entered this movie expecting this group of teens to be sent into a second trial, like the first, which they would have to fight off more strange living robotic creatures to find another solution bringing them one step closer to solving the riddle behind everyone's death. But instead of getting what the title of the movie implies, I got something entirely different. Now, I'd like to go on the record and say that i thoroughly enjoyed myself watching The Scorch Trials. The plot was fast paced, the acting was, once again excellent, the injustice and crimes against humanity by the governing force was real and hit straight to the heart; you find yourself rooting for these teens to survive and find a way to stop the horrible acts against their fellow Maze solving individuals. The film keeps in tow with current themes in pop culture, such as teens choosing to get drunk and party, hiding from the truth and difficulty of what life really is, or maybe just people taking advantage of others for their own gain. But we are always left hoping that they make the wise choice and the best decisions and help each other, because this movie really is about having faith that humanity isn't lost and that some people are inherently good.  The Scorch Trials, though different from what you might have expected is an exciting journey standing up for itself and running alongside it's predecessor as it's own entity. It left me excited for what will come next in the post apocalyptic world of WCKD and the Right Army questioning who will win, and who is right? Yes there were strange zombie creatures, and yes it wasn't what I was expecting, but YES, I had a great time in the movies blown away by a teen-aged version of Mad Max racing through the desert while being chased by a violent and possibly evil regime. Go see this movie with an open mind ready for an exciting journey.Book + movie: different universe I don't know what to think about this movie. I read the book and I was super excited for the movie, of course. But the screenplay... So different from the book and I usually like when there's a minimum of similarities.  I just don't get why they changed it. It was a good formula; WICKED sends them in the Scorch, Jorge and Brenda appears no longer after, and finally, the encounter with the girls. I felt like seeing a whole new movie, but only with the book's main characters.  I also think the relation between Brenda and Thomas was not enough clear. It is crystal clear in the book that she feels something for him and we know it, but the scene in the movie went so fast that we later realize that she liked him.  My favorite part: when Newt calls Thomas: TOMMY !!!! But... Because the actors were good and the screenplay seemed fitting, I still look forward to the Death Cure !Dear God... Why Why Why Why Why Why All the way through this god awful film I questioned every character action. Like why not take the gun after Winston shoots himself? Is a gun only good for letting Winston commit suicide? Why take so long when the building is collapsing? Why are you staring at the zombies?? RUN!!! Why skate along a board walk whilst holding the handrail? SPRINT!! The only reason I watched this shitty film is because I made the mistake of watching the first one... I don't like leaving movie franchises unfinished... Do Not Watch This Piece Of *beep*!!! They could have done something great with this film yet it is riddled with the typical movie error of: That Is Not What Anyone Would Do In That Situation!A disappointment after seeing the first movie This movie was completely not in line with my expectations. I haven't read the books so my expectation was based on the first movie. The movie started quite OK but very fast the story went in a completely opposite way from what I was expecting and become another walking zombie movie like I have seen so many others. Where the first movie was build around an original concept this movie is what I would call a cheap copy of existing zombie movies. I found it a waste of time and caught me thinking "what kind of b*llsh*t am I watching". I checked the spoiler flag because what I wrote about the zombies tells more or less the complete story of this movie. Very disappointing.What a way to ruin the book... Being someone who loved the books in the Maze Runner series I couldn't wait to see this film, as I thought the first installment was brilliant, however by the end of The Scorch Trials I wish I hadn't bothered.  For a start the whole point of this movie was that it was the next phase of the trials to test the group further, instead the group escape and are then being hunted for the rest of the feature. Not only this, but the group seek to find a faction - The Right Arm - however this rebellion isn't even mentioned until the third book - why has it been brought in so early? Another annoying aspect was, due to the order of the film being distorted, I had no idea when the film was going to end, therefore it felt like it was dragging somewhat after the 1hr 30min mark. Rant over. Credit where credit is due - I never felt bored during this film. Despite the constant feeling of "that's not what happens" it had me intrigued as to where it might be going, although I can't even begin to imagine what could happen in the next sequel. Overall Scorch Trials isn't that bad, it's action packed and is always on the move, however it's just massively disappointing that such a good book has been completely changed so that it's barely recognisable.Absolutely Brilliant I encourage you not to be swayed by those reviews that state this has ruined the maze runner film. It really hasn't trust me ... if you want action this film has it, the sheer suspense of this film had me and my brother on the edge of our seat. This films brings so many directions for the 3rd film to go on and i really cant wait till its out already. Dylan O'Brien's performance in this film is excellent, taking on the role of the leader of the "pack" him and his loyal friends go through many problems. The shocking twists to this film are absolutely brilliant and i promise you will shouting "OMG" in not just one occasion  Definitely one of the best films of the year, so i couldn't recommend it more if i tried to anyone watching it.The running dead! Probably the best film I've seen in 2015 so far, along with Mad Max. Since I'm a book nerd, I did expect much from this film, and I got even more. I am actually not sure which one is better. There's a lot of changes for sure, but I consider it to be a positive thing since you get two awesome things, not only one. Great effects, great cast. A good sense of humor and some high class action. It's like 10 genres combined in one film. Not suitable for children though, in my opinion. The guy, 25+ years old, that was sitting next to me was scared as hell. Cranks do look somewhat scarier then the walkers in TWD, and are faster and more aggressive. Comparing to the first film, you can imagine The Maze Runner being a toddler, and The scorch trials being an adult. It is definitely more serious and hardcore. One more film TST has reminded me of was Snowpiercer, so if you're a fan you'll definitely like it.
Not for fans of substance, Jupiter Ascending is a glossy, entertaining, hot mess. I'm not sure how to start this review so I'll just get right into it: This movie isn't good. It makes no sense. There is no room to get immersed in this world because there is no story to relate to. It's all just stuff happening; fluff. Beautiful, well made fluff mind you, but at its core this movie is a steaming hot mess. Here's the plot from what I gathered: Mila Kunis is suddenly the majesty of the Earth and has to protect it from a bunch of rich douchebags that live in Jupiter's atmosphere who want to use it for harvesting grounds or something. It's a dumb plot, and every scene that tries to move the plot forward is a scene wasted. The only interesting parts of this movie are the visuals and Channing Tatum's character, but even he is given absolutely no character development. He's just a badass space agent, or something. I don't even remember. The characters end up the same way they began - there was no journey to redemption or revelation for anyone. It was just do this, do that, stop this, go home, the end. And they try to include multiple stories, like Mila Kunis' relationship with her family (boooring); Caine (Tatum) and Stinger's (Sean Bean) history (wholly underdeveloped), the whole villain arc... The villains in this movie are spoiled brats. Seriously. They're not scary, they're not intimidating, there was no point in the movie where I was like "oh man sh*t is about to go down"; there was just no intrigue. Their motives were all over the place. It's not worth trying to piece together every plot point they throw into the movie because it will just lead to confusion and disappointment, and eventually frustration when you realize how much potential was wasted in creating this massive universe. The lizards looked really cool. Why not have more of them? Oh we're just going to focus on the playboy brat now, okay. I really wanted to care about this universe. It has a Star Wars vibe in parts, like the "royal" wedding scene and the space battles, but there were no good characters to experience this adventure with. You're just watching things happen with no consequences, or at least none you cared about. The acting was fine in this movie. Channing Tatum and Sean Bean in particular gave great performances, and Eddie Redmayne as the primary antagonist was decent as well. Yeah, he's an Academy Award winner, and as much as I hate to say it I have not seen The Theory of Everything yet but I loved him in Les Mis so I was really hoping he would save this movie. Unfortunately the material he's given is absolute garbage, so in an effort to make the character stand out, Redmayne give him a weird, eerie, whisper voice that was akin to a hundred year old man trying to force words out from the back of his throat. But hey, I think it worked. The guy is completely unlikeable so might as well give him a unique trait to remember him by. Good on Mr. Redmayne because he succeeded. The only things I will remember about this movie are the cool visuals, the wasted potential, and his creepy voice. Don't see this movie. Unless you want to see some really great CGI for a couple hours, which can be found in much better places by the way, you won't find anything worth salvaging from Jupiter Ascending. It was a nice effort but ultimately a swing and a miss.An ambitious, epic universe marred by one dimensional characters and a stumbling script When I give this film a 6, it's being a bit generous. Trying to put myself in other people's shoes, I'd say this film probably range anywhere from a 3 to a 5, and then there will be those who hate it. Still, I am likely to lean on the side of one of the few who likes the film. But it's a mixed bag. Sure enough, the special effects, action, and other elements are fantastic. But the film does little to develop it's own character beyond their archetypes and the script seems content to stay average at best. Jupiter Ascending actually paints a pretty fascinating sci-fi universe. As it turns out, Earth, and thousands of other worlds like it, are owned by a number of different families which act like corporations who seed these worlds. Once the worlds become over populated, their people are harvested to create a youth serum which keeps those living in the corporate society young for millennia after millennia. In this case, the Abraxis family is one of the most powerful and each of three heirs is vying for control of Earth. Standing in their way, however, is Jupiter Jones, who turns out to be the genetic reincarnation of the Abraxis' sibling's mother, and claimant to the throne of the family.  If all of that sounds like a lot to take in, it is, and easily the best part of the film. The Wachowski's have a talent for creating fascinating worlds that feel complete. Here, they have created a massive sci-fi universe the likes of which we haven't seen in at least a decade, maybe longer. It's very clear that their ambition extends beyond just this one story. In fact, there are hundreds of fascinating stories that could be told about this universe. The idea of a corporate controlled universe is timely, and where we've seen this story played out before about the giant corporation versus the little guy, it's never quite been told on this scale.  It's a shame then that this ambition is wasted on a story that doesn't seem to capitalize on such a universe. The story is good, but the script is lacking and the characters never really become all that interesting. They end up feeling like caricatures meant to introduce us to this world we've entered. They're histories are explained and they clearly have fleshed out back stories, but they feel almost lifeless in that they seem to be here only to be an aspect of this world and not a full character. Even as a lead character, Channing Tatum as Caine feels like little more than a body meant to perform choreography and defend Milas Kunis' Jupiter. At the very least, Jupiter is a sympathetic character who shows shades of change, but even she often feels like little more than a narrator meant to ask question for exposition purposes. Eddie Redmayne seems to have the juiciest part, and though he still seems to be a one dimensional villain, he shows emotional depth that the other characters lack.  Most people I suspect will have trouble forgiving the lack of a truly meaningful script and characters that are too one dimensional. But the good news is that the film isn't a complete loss. The action, which the Wachowski's have proved to have a handle on, is fantastic. This is Star Wars level stuff, with space battles and well choreographed martial art duels. The cool tech thrown in, like the gravity boots, add some imaginative spice that once again shows the Wachowski's propensity for finding ways to justify making a 12 year old's imagination a reality. It's some truly fun stuff. Likewise, the world we're introduced to looks fantastic. The special effects make believable some very interesting and exciting details, such as the multitude of gadgets and weapons we're witness to. It's clear that the Wachowski's have set out to create a unique universe, and in my estimation, they have succeeded. I'm a sucker for this kind of world crafting, and so they get higher marks from me.  Of course, I can see why the film was pushed back to the dumping grounds of February. This was meant to be a summer blockbuster, but up against so many big, successful films, it would have a hard time competing. I have the distinct feeling this is going to be a film that gets left behind this year, especially in favor of bigger films being released throughout 2015. Had the film been more focused on it's characters and less on exposition of the universe we're witnessing, then I feel it could have succeeded and become a modern sci-fi classic. But as is, it falls short. Honestly, I do hope for a sequel to this, if only to see this universe continue to get development. Perhaps a sequel would fulfill the ambition the Wachowski's clearly seek to build upon.A brain-squeezing Space Opera. What more do you want? 'Jupiter Ascending' was panned (I suspect) by the same small brains that only love to slag by comparison. I'm thinking of "Kings Solomon's Mines" in the shadow of "Raiders". I'm thinking of "Fifth Element" being compared to 'Star Wars'. I'm thinking "new Batman" to "old Batman". And on, and on.  Well, a fickle fie on that that.  "Jupiter Ascending" is fun, is spectacular, and is in no way sillier than the original 'Star Wars' (as in episode IV). Yes, the gravity- surfing boots were hokey, but no more than light sabers or (Oh) The Voice of Obi from Beyond. I mean, and flipping' heck! Does everything in cinema have to be mean and retro and grungy and full of old failing and aging superheroes with bad knees and depression? This all getting so tired so fast. I loved this film precisely because it was full of meaningless gloss, and bless the Matrix Guys for not making another self-referential piece of pablum. It's fun. It's stupid. It has nothing to tell us about the meaning of life. It's not Deep, Portentous and Meaningful tripe like 'Avatar' and 'After Earth'. Thank goodness! 'Jupiter Ascending' is A-grade Space Opera and let's just leave it at that.  Get a life, critics.Not a classic of the genre but very entertaining This film is basically a mash-up of Dune, John Carter and Doctor Who (and quite a few others). And a very well made and hugely entertaining mash-up at that. I enjoyed it. Not a classic of the genre but very entertaining - although I can understand some people getting upset at not being able to follow the somewhat demanding, fast paced, multi-level story, whispered dialogue, and unconventional narrative. I especially liked the neat blend of science fiction and fantasy and the nice fairy tale vibe. I loved those dragons. I enjoyed it about as much as I enjoyed Blade Runner and The Fifth Element. It certainly does not deserve some of the ridiculously negative reviews that I have seen. Which just goes to show it is all a question of personal taste I suppose.I do not understand all the hate for this movie. Literally, just a few weeks before this movie was released, I had been thinking "Why haven't there been any fun space opera films recently? Well, one that isn't part of a Marvel franchise?" And then Jupiter Ascending opened - and lo and behold, the Wachowskis delivered. I am old enough to remember having seen Flash Gordon and The Empire Strikes Back in the theaters. Space opera was very much an integral part of my childhood, and Jupiter Ascending is right there with some of the best I've seen. Then I heard all the negative reviews, and was baffled. Did these reviewers see the same movie I had? What happened? Do they hate fun? Is Chris Pratt the only one allowed to have fun in Hollywood anymore? Is it the fact that Jupiter Ascending has a female protagonist and caters to a female gaze? Maybe it's not specifically aimed at the dudebros to whom the Hollywood business machine seems to be pandering mostly these days, but they can still enjoy it nevertheless? Did the Hollywood suits see the Wachowski's jab at the corporate oligarchy and feel personally threatened? Are they still bumhurt that the Matrix sequels didn't quite live up to the original? Did seeing shirtless Channing Tatum/shirtless Eddie Redmayne make them feel all funny inside? We may never know the answers to any of these questions, but one thing is clear; Jupiter Ascending is the fun space opera movie that you need in your life right now. Ignore the haters and see it!It could have been amazing. It could have become a blockbuster franchise. It could have boosted the Wachowskis' careers. But that's all Jupiter Ascending is. I'll be upfront and warn those contemplating watching Jupiter Ascending that you need to go in with low expectations to enjoy the film. Unless your idea of what makes a film good is huge explosions, pretty characters prancing around in elaborate costumes and beautiful visuals. After all, who cares about plot, lines and pacing right? Jupiter Ascending is really very much a visual feast but nothing more than that. The action sequences are generally well paced and I applaud the fact that CGI for the actions were kept minimal. The costumes are stunning (as are the actors). Which is a great pity because, on paper, Jupiter Ascending really had potential. For a start, like all sci-fi films, Jupiter Ascending is ambitious in its storytelling. An entirely different reality of an alternative universe with its own ecosystem, species and history is created. There are soldiers spliced with animal DNAs such as Caine (Channing Tatum) who has some wolf in him and Stinger (Sean Bean) who has some bee in him (guess where they got their names from?). There was potential to explore and mine all that richness for more stories but this is undermined by the weak delivery of the first film in what the studios were probably hoping would be a new franchise. While the plot of Jupiter Ascending was hackneyed, it had pretty interesting characters whose backstories would have been fun for the audience to explore. I could have seen the many fanfiction pieces that fans would have spun off from the story of Caine, Jupiter and the Abrasax family. Let's be honest, the basic plot line of The Matrix, the film franchise that the Wachowskis are renowned for, was pretty clich√© too ‚Äì the story of a Chosen One who comes out of nowhere and whose destiny is to save the world. It was the treatment of this plot premise (as well as really cool action sequences and visuals) that made The Matrix such a groundbreaking series. Jupiter Ascending's basic plot premise was this too but the treatment was a complete letdown. The cast is also one that is renowned for not just their good looks but also their ability to act. Somehow though, the directors succeeded in not tapping on that ability. I can't help but wonder what kind of directions Andy and Lana Wachowskis gave Eddie Radmayne for me to give such an exaggerated and overly affected performance as Balem. It reminds me somewhat chillingly of how Natalie Portman almost killed her career with her expressionless and emotionless turn as Amidala in the Stars Wars prequel trilogy. At least Radmayne has The Theory of Everything that is out in the same season and that can probably help cushion the fallout from Jupiter Ascending. To the Wachowskis' credit, Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum have some chemistry. While their performances are not going to garner them any Oscars, they put in decent performances to, I think, ward off any Razzie nominations. It also helps that they are pretty easy on the eye. Apart from these three actors, it is hard to discern the performances put in by the rest of the cast as their characters do not appear to add to the story. It makes it difficult for one to give a fair critique of their performances hence I'll refrain from that here. Jupiter Ascending could also have been one of the few female-led action films that could have been a successful film franchise, showing that when female-led action films succeed, it's not necessarily a quirk. This would have been helpful in Hollywood's evolution (if you haven't figured out from my name, yes, I'm female). It also could have been the film that would have move the Wachowskis' career out of its current state where the siblings are now more renowned for the visual flash and bang in their films rather than the creative storytelling and treatment that was showcased in The Matrix.Everything that is wrong with cinema today is seen in this movie The movie feels like it was written by a ten year old girl hooked on drugs. Cardboard characters are so undeveloped that they should have stayed in authors womb for few more months/years. Bad acting and "I don't care about what is going on" attitude from the actors brings final nail to this movie coffin. There is nothing substantial in this movie, nothing that can teach us something new about ourselves or the world around us, which is quite odd for the science fiction movie. True the cinematography of the movie is first class, but it only saddens me that it is used on such bad material. In the end don't get fooled by this movie. Its only purpose is to take your money with bright lights and a false promise, but it will leave you with a mouth full of ash, wondering why you wasted your time.A whole lot better than its rep! One reviewer claimed its story could have been written by "a ten year old girl on drugs". Well I've met some ten year old girls with astonishing imaginations, so I'm not sure that that's much of a criticism. True, if you're looking for deep this ain't it, but the same could be said for "The Matrix", not to mention just about every video game ever made. Then of course there's "Star Wars" which 10 year-old (and those who think like them) find deeply profound and meaningful. Purely as escapist entertainment, "Jupiter Ascending" is awesome. Mila Kunis is superb. A week after watching it I still can't get it out of my mind. I plan to buy a copy of the DVD so I can watch it again.Good Entertainment. Really Don't Get The Low Score Sometimes I really don't get IMDb and critics I avoided this movie like the plague as it had such low ratings by users and critics, so I thought it would be a complete waste of time But I've upgraded my home projector recently, and it supports 3D, and since then, I'm having fun in trying this format. Wachowski's always make great visuals, so I jumped into it because of the 3D, but with very low expectations regarding the movie To my complete surprise, it turned out the movie was very good, in the sense it was highly entertaining The story has it's flaws, like any regular movie, but it's not a complete nonsense like some people try to sell you Can't understand how rubbish movies like Fast&amp;Furious 7 and Iron Man 3 make millions at the box office and have such good ratings, where this one flopped and has such poor ones I mean even complete trash like Godzilla, Robocop (2014), John Carter and San Andreas have a higher score than Jupiter Ascending!!! What a hell is going on with you people?An underrated sci-fantasy movie When I was a little girl, I often played at being a princess: I would be very beautiful, have lots of suitors and live in a gorgeous castle. I would also be very clever (I would often invent the elevator) and a good ruler for my subjects. I would then fall in love with a chivalrous young man who had faced a great danger for me, like dragons, evil sorcerers or highwaymen. I am a grown woman now, but somewhere inside me this little girl is still there. And she loved "Jupiter Ascending". This isn't a movie to watch for its philosophical message (even if there is one) or for its social commentary (even if you could find one). This is a movie to watch and be immersed in a whole new world, be amazed by its beautiful landscapes, architecture, costumes, and by its cool gadgets (seriously, who wouldn't want flying boots like Caine's?) and spaceships. This is a film to watch and indulge in your craziest childhood fantasies, like flying, going to another planet, being queen of the universe, you name it, and to be entertained.  If this world created by the Wachowskis is so immersive, it's not only because it's well thought and beautifully designed, but also thanks to the cast. In this review, I would like to single out two performances.  Mila Kunis plays the lead, Jupiter Jones, an underprivileged girl who dreams of a better life. Kunis, with her good looks, could have seemed fake in this role, but no, she is credible and very relatable (and this is important, since she also is the audience surrogate). One common criticism of the film is that she's too passive. It isn't completely fair. Jupiter isn't an action hero, but an everywoman catapulted in a foreign world, forced to play a game without knowing all the rules. But she learns quickly and grows as a woman throughout the movie.  The most unfairly criticized performance from this movie is Eddie Redmayne's, playing the villainous Balem Abrasax. It's true that his performance is over-the-top, but this is because he plays an over- the-top character. Balem is a thousands-years-old power-mad psychopath who combines an unhinged mind with a complete lack of morals, and Redmayne portrays him very well.  The rest of the cast is great, too. Every character seems real, even the ones we don't know much about.  "Jupiter Ascending" also has good moments of humor and knows when not to take itself too seriously. This is all "make-believe" after all.  The only regret I have towards this movie is that it's standalone. I would have loved to explore more of this universe and its characters in a sequel.Awful, awful awful. This film is bad. You'd think after the total disaster of John Carter (on Mars) someone somewhere would learn that if you take sci-fi and just throw millions and millions and millions of dollars at it is will just be rubbish. And by god is this rubbish. (It's worse than that Jim, It's s, h, i and t).  This film is so bad I just don't know where to start. Hang on - I'm going to have a cup of tea and a think. OK. It has no redeeming qualities at all. The film, not the tea, The story is so badly written that I was just sighing to myself every five minutes.  It basically goes like this: Large bit of exposition explaining what they are going to do next then they go and do what they were saying there were going to do in a huge amount of silly CGI. We have seen so many action scenes that we all know anything can be done, but we need to have a vested interest in at least one of the characters to give a damn whether they live or die, and in this whole movie I couldn't care less if everyone died.  The tone of the film is perplexing. In the first few minutes this bloke is shot dead for no reason. Then the main character is born at sea under a particular constellation pertaining to something to do with astrology, but this is never mentioned again. Then there is a woman in her knickers and bra for some reason. Don't know why. Then Jupiter Jones leaves the earth then she's a queen and we are suddenly in Terry Gilliam's Brazil, complete with Central Services and a cameo from TG himself. (Naughty Terry).  The Wachowski directors have just stolen from FLASH, DUNE, BRAZIL, 2000AD and any other Sci-Fi source they can find. There is even a 2001 space station in one shot. They have proved over the last four films that they have got nothing left to say at all. The film is so Flash Gordon there is even a forced wedding scene with the hero Flash turning up on a space scooter and crashing in at the right moment, oh sorry he's not Flash, he's ‚Äì I don't know or care, because I've lost the will to live, because there is no suspense and there is no logic to anything. Then not-Flash rescues not-Dale and we have to go through the whole thing again, but this time Ming, sorry, some bloke I never got the name of - who has got a very sore throat and serious Oedipus issues and played by the unfortunate Eddie Redmayne (I bet he wishes he'd got his BAFTA earlier and not had to endure this pile of steaming llamas plop) needs Not-Dale to put her royal seal on a document so he can own Earth, and she has to abdicate, without doing anything of any use whilst being Queen, how about a few edicts? I'd at least ask to see the Royal Mint and get some coins done we me on them. But no. Not-Dale goes off without even a ray gun to see the baddest man in the universe and right at the last minute not-Flash hurtles in and saves the day on another space scooter thing. (His insurance premiums must be astronomical), And of course because he's broken the window at the top of the factory, the whole place is going to go up. I don't know about you, but if I was going to build some sort of factory in the middle of Jupiter where the atmosphere is incredibly fierce, the gravity is gigantic, the electrical storms are the size of EARTH, I would build some sort of fail safe and make certain that if some twit with a space scooter crashed into my big window the whole place wouldn't disintegrate with the speed of the Titanic hitting a massive iceberg. And the baddie dies falling off a tall thing. OMG!! How many bad guys have to die falling off tall things? At least Ming got a big rocket ship through his guts. If I was a bad guy I'd live in a bungalow. Then some space people who were bad, but then good and then bad who may be friends with Sean Bean do some stuff and are then good people, but then they nip off, but luckily just in time to save Not-Flash and Not-Dale and oh, for Heaven's sake. I don't care I really don't. And then they are back on Earth. Sorry? What? She's the queen of the flipping universe and can do anything and she goes back to cleaning the toilets? Can you IMAGINE how angry her hard working mother would be if she knew her daughter was the heiress to billions and she wasn't doing anything with it? Why the hell do you think she left Russia to go to the USA? In search of a new life! Not to clean toilets! And the Not-Flash bloke has got wings at the end, Oh for sake of Peter Jackson is this Lord of the Rings? He's even got Vulcan Elf ears!! Is there no originality AT ALL in this movie??? Come on!! Couldn't he have had a penis in the middle of his forehead to indicate he was an alien. Oh? He has got one of those? Sorry didn't notice. And they all speak perfect English and apparently the Earth was seeded with genes from, Oh I don't care, I just couldn't care less anymore, this is awful, and I've run out of tea. And there's some big sci-fi Lizards with wings called Mr. flipping Ben or something. SIGH.  There was one nice shot of the planet Jupiter with all the moons around it in 3D that I did quite like, but that was nothing to do with the W Brothers - that's actually there.I said WOW more times than any movie before The critics leave out one very critical piece of information. To have fit so much story and so much action with so much new and amazing effects in so short a time is just short of miraculous. To fit so much story it is a VERY fast moving plot. If you can't absorb complex plots quickly, you won't be able to keep up. To move from simple earth girl to universe royalty in 127 minutes is a huge undertaking and it was well done. When I read it was over two hours thinking it was only 90 minutes tells you how fast this movie goes by. Its an amazing ride! The action is immense with breathtaking scenes just as ridiculous and unbelievable as the best Avengers, Matrix and Batman can come up with.Difference is the immensely advanced effects. This movie moved the computer effects scale up several notches over anything I have seen and integrates those effects so matter of factly as to leave you in awe. I am still reeling at how much artwork went into this film. You become so used to the barrage of amazing vistas and generated imagery that you have to focus on the characters to keep from missing the story. Simply have to see this a few more times to get more of the awesome work done in this film. The break from the licensing sequence was fun and funny. The makeup and proppery of the alien characters and devices throughout is phenomenal. The cost of packing so much into so short a venue is in the number of characters. There are fewer characters than a slow movie would have and the story is rushed to fit in a 127 minute film!! A sacrifice I am willing to take. Channing did an amazing job of legionnaire and While Mila's character is too casual about adapting to the universe she is always a lovely fun and absorbing actress!! Huge plot holes in a 127 minute film that could have been 4 hours, gave it 9 of 10, but JA sets the bar for explosive fantasy sci fi films of this era. Wuchowski's skills are developing way past Matrix. Watch these guys, they have a monstrous future.  Thanks for the amazing film Gentlemen!! WAHOOOO !!Total Crap Guys, this movie was a joke¬Ö It seems like they took all the extra costumes from 'Flash Gordon', 'CG from any Transformer movie, "screenwriting" from 'The Last Starfighter', and character development for 'Gigli' and overall logic from 'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai across the 8th Dimension' and put them together! Basic breakdown¬Ö Act I. Kidnap + Rescue + Channing Tatum on magic roller-skates + Redmayne Overacting Act II. Kidnap + Rescue + Channing Tatum on magic roller-skates + Redmayne Overacting Act III. Kidnap + Rescue + Mila Kunis on magic roller-skatesGreat fun I watched this on TV after seeing the IMDb rating. Despite seeing the IMDb rating. My expectations were low and they were greatly exceeded. Visually gorgeous, silly science fiction that I can't help bracketing with the Fifth Element. Of course it isn't deep, but it is very entertaining, has a great cast and lots of action. Couldn't help but compare Eddie Redmayne to Gary Oldman, and Channing Tatum to Brad Pitt. Mila was plenty good enough. I think it's a great shame that this movie has such a low rating and I give it a seven. It kept me thoroughly entertained throughout. I'm trying to think of other fun, silly, original SF movies that come into the same category. Flash Gordon and Dune come to mind.Hey Morpheus, If I take both the red pill and the blue pill will I get my 127 minutes back? I would have thought that after the 15+ years since The Matrix that consumers would be less and less dazzled by visual effects in film, but apparently I was the only one to take the red pill and see beyond the illusion of this movie. Sure you'll get otherworldly visuals and some pretty neat future-tech in Jupiter Ascending but that's where the takeaway stops.  The story is a classic one where a seemingly insignificant individual, in this case Jupiter Jones (Kunis), is suddenly thrust into a much larger and complicated universe than her day-to-day as a maid. As fate would have it, she happens to be the reincarnation of the matriarch of an extremely powerful dynasty that controls a vast industrial empire in the galaxy. The oldest heir to the mother's inheritance is none other than Oscar-nominee Eddie Redmayne, who for whatever reason has difficulty speaking and doesn't want Jupiter to claim what is rightfully hers.  I'll give the Wachowskis that they they've created an incredibly elaborate alternate universe that is equally rich in scope and potential, but they fail to generate the least bit of depth to their characters. Every person you meet is a one-dimensional caricature you'd find in some other sci-fi story. Honestly the scope is too ambitious to warrant any initial investment in Jupiter or any of the other supporting actors like Channing Tatum and Sean Bean. It's literally just 2 hours of zero-tension action sequences and clich√©d dialogue that lead to a resolution that the audience couldn't care less about.  Sure the tech is pretty cool and I was pleasantly surprised by the design of the ships and planetary locales, but the novelty of seeing Channing Tatum ice-skate around the air fighting aliens that pose little threat wears off after the first scene. It's like watching the Jedi take on the droids in the Star Wars Prequels. Why even bother putting them in the way if they don't pose the slightest inconvenience to our protagonists? I can appreciate science fantasy that dazzles and delights in an original universe, but eventually the tunnel-vision wears off and you realize that there is very little to keep you invested in the story. The planet Jupiter might actually be the most ironic and appropriate metaphor for this movie since - sure it's pretty to look - but then you realize you're just looking a big ball of the two most common gasses in the universe.  Read the expanded version and other reviews on the Drive-In Zeppelin websiteShallow, boring, a complete waste of money. Jupiter Ascending, a film that deals with subjects that I'm sure a millennia old advanced species would have no interest in, such as wealth, materialism, physical appearances and girl crushes. A totally shallow film with not a single redeeming feature. The Wachowskis should be ashamed of themselves. It was a good job we had a gift certificate because if we had spent the full ¬£20 on the film I would have been mortified. I walked out before the end of the film as I didn't care the slightest about the fate of any of the characters and it was pretty obvious that the ending would be a complete happy ending clich√©. These sorts of films make me want to give up on the modern film industry, they only spew out high budget garbage to appease the idiots. Excuse me while I go watch some Hitchcock or something. Urgh.Just plain awful This was easily one of the worst movies I have ever been to. What else can be said. Everything about it was just awful. And I went in knowing it was going to be a terrible story, but maybe I would enjoy the special effects and action scenes. Unfortunately, a man-dog wearing eyeliner roller skating in the air fighting bad guys looks as ridiculous and dumb as it sounds. Mila Kunis felt completely miscast and had no chemistry with Channing Tatum, who was playing the same boring dumb hero he always does. The action sequences were a mess... impossible to tell what was going on. I watch a lot of movies and have only walked out on a handful in my life, but I could not make it through more than 70 minutes of this ridiculous film. Don't waste your time. It's awful. It boggles my mind how a movie like this gets made. Someone please stop these two from making any more!A brilliant "waste of time" Brilliant, absolutely brilliant! For me, this is one of the best movies in history of cinema. If you did not see it already, then go to the cinema and watch it before you read further. I apologize for my not so polished English. It's not my first language, and I'm still learning it. I went to the cinema with almost no information about this movie. All I know was its a sci-fi. I had no clue who plays in it, or who directed it. First surprise came at the ticket booth. The ticket price was around 15% higher then any other movies I have seen*. This must be a real good movie... After twenty minutes I was already bored by the clich√©s. East European emigrant in USA with huge dreams, became a toilet cleaner, but soon she will be saved by a werewolf and she will be some kind of princess of the "world". What an original idea... As some other reviewers pointed out, the movie is full of scenes borrowed from other movies and video games, as far as I see. Scenes, music, sound effects. Everything. Stunning visual effects, but shallow story and almost non existent character development. For the first sight... After an hour I could not believe that I paid for this... This was the first movie I was trying to sleep in. At the end there was a single sentence that stuck in my head: time is the single most precious thing in the universe. Funny, a film seemingly completely waste of time talks about your precious time. With friends we talk about the movie for an hour. The conclusion: it is so pointless that this must be the point. Then, next day it hit me! It hit me so hard, first I had to sit down, then I was walking around in my room for a half hour. This movie is like a huge puzzle. It makes no sense until you find the corner pieces. I think I found one of those pieces. TIME, the single most precious thing in the universe. This movie is about Us, about how we live, about how we waste our precious time. Its about the clich√©s filling our life. The first thought of her at morning: "I hate my life!" Didn't you ever thought that? Her mother and aunt works dutifully, like robots. They are the modern slaves of our days. She is dreaming about a better life, about expensive clothes, while the rich girl can not decide which cloth she should wear when her rich boyfriend will "ask her" to merry him. We all know this will not happen, but she believes it. She wants to be a wife of a rich guy. A toilet cleaner emigrant with brand new iPhone? We are working to get money, to buy things we can not afford. Her uncle practically try to sell her body parts ‚Äì eggs- and take most of the money, just because "this is capitalism". Spending money before you have it. Anyone? He spends on what? Big screen TV and video games. Things he can not afford, but he thinks it will change his life. He waste money so he can wast more time. ...these are just the first few minutes! It contains countless references to movies, video games, books, to different parts of popular culture, even religions. In every scene you can find parts of other movies, games, books. Just watch it and find your pieces. We are products, just as depicted in the movie. We are just numbers on some rich and powerful peoples spreadsheet. We are money machines. Do you think most movies are made for us? NO! Most movies are made for profit. Look at the movies of the last decade. They can sell a movie with a shallow story,and stunning visuals. They can sell it with an actor. They can sell it with just a name behind it. Most people praise this movie for the stunning visuals, Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum (their bodies, not their act). Here is a movie with so deep meanings, that almost no one notices. Its not hidden. It pokes our eyes. But we can't see it. There were so many meaningless movies in the last decade, we can't see any difference. We don't even expect movies with any deeper meaning. Most of the movies and video games are just escapes from our life. I feel I need to say a few more words about the end of the movie to make it round. Did you noticed, she was smiling at the end, even while cleaning the toilet? She was not whining about her life any more. She wake up early, made coffee, and she was happier when she got that old brass telescope then when she become the absolute ruler of the Earth. She did change, but not the way you expected. She enjoys the little details of the life. Enjoys her work, even if its toilet cleaning, enjoys the morning coffee with her family, the noisy dinner. For me, it seems like, she understood that time is our single most precious thing in the universe. She enjoys every moment of her life :) As I said, this movie es a brilliant piece of art. It is about our life. You just need to find a corner piece of the puzzle. I showed one piece for you! Wake up Neo! Now go, waste some more of your precious time, watch this movie again, and find your corner pieces, make your puzzle complete :) I will do the same. I have to watch this again... Thank you for your precious time, I hope it worth reading :) PS*: probably the higher ticket price was just a coincidence. But it made more impact. The pain of wasting my time was stronger.Unfairly criticized; worth a watch! I saw Jupiter Ascending tonight (after a VERY long wait I might add). Sadly it is not in the vain of other Wachowski films in terms of thought- provoking subject matter; however, I feel this film is being very unfairly criticized.  No: the subject matter is not as deep or profound as in The Matrix, V for Vendetta, or the masterful Cloud Atlas. But it was never advertised to be that kind of film--it's a solid blockbuster movie (with plenty of room for sequels and/or prequels). I'd see it again! If you're considering watching this film, but hesitate after reading the same scathing reviews that I came across, just consider what interests you about the movie: if you're looking a movie with a complex plot and lots of underlying messages, this might not be the best choice. It's a blockbuster film pure and simple. A good one! But a very typical blockbuster/action/romance movie.Visually Amazing Jupiter Ascending, quite literally, is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The visual effects and CGI were top notch; nothing looked unfinished. Everything from explosions and action scenes, to space ships and settings, this movie had all the "eye candy" one could want. The fighting sequences were executed perfectly; each one thrilling in its own way. Each singular planet or world was so stunning and precisely crafted, that one could almost feel themselves in it. The Wachowskis have made a truly gorgeous universe in their latest movie.  Michael Giacchino's music fits each scene very nicely whether it is a fast paced chase scene, or a quiet and thoughtful scene. It has a mysterious and almost hollow beauty to it, which fits this movie perfectly. Alas, not everything in this movie is as good as the visuals. Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis give surprisingly good performances for the most part but some of their acting is just off. The other principal actors give good performances as well but all the acting could have been taken a notch higher.  Story and Plot is where this movie is weakest though. It has so much ambition and intricacy that it is to much to fit in a two hour long movie. Even though two hours is a good length, the plot just wants to keep on going and therefor the loose ends are never quite tied up. The plot is never really explained to its entirety and while one can figure out the general idea, it is hard to go deep into it. It has huge potential but rather than using it, it discards it. I give it credit for being fairly original though, and not a sequel, reboot, or based of a graphic novel or book. Originality is a great thing and the Wachowskis do it best.  Overall Jupiter Ascending lacked plot depth and great acting abilities, but it won it all back with groundbreaking visuals. Even though many more big movies are coming out in 2015, this one would be one of the best for all we know. It may not be everyone's piece of cake, but it sure is a fun sci-fi adventure that shouldn't be forgotten.Stupid, aimless, empty, dreadful and DERIVATIVE non-spectacle The Brothers are no longer, and their films are getting worse by the movie. This drivel is supposed to be about a wretched anglo-Russian girl (Kunis) who miraculously has the same genetic imprint as a millennia-old royal just dead in outer space. The royal was part of a family looking for profit from creating life on suitable planets which are then farmed for their body fluids to produce immortal bath salts for those who can pay. Cra* concept and an even worse script, direction, and character development has resulted! It is all CGI, but for what? The characters are totally uninteresting. Even the evil offspring of the dead royal, who just ooze 'orribleness and are of course played by British actors (including star of the moment Eddie Redmayne!), are one-dimensional. The hero, half wolf, half man, Channing Tatum, remains stony faced and just jets about on a set of gravity boots better than Superman! The only interest is Sean Bean and whether he will last beyond the second reel. From the trailer he looked certain for an early demise but he keeps hanging on! The script is just a series of bang crashes, and scenes of jeopardy for our two leads and how are they going to get out of them - yawn, yawn! The CGI is boring inside two minutes. And the whole film is a derivative sham. You will recognise 'Star Wars' 'North by North West' 'Jurassic Park 2' 'Superman' 'Flash Gordon' and particularly 'Dune' as well as many others. Oh, it is truly awful!!!!!!!!!! Brother and sister - give up film making now and save the industry from another mega ($170M) flop!Don't ever listen to the others I liked the trailer but because of all these negative comments I didn't watch it in the theater after all. And I regret it so much now. I was bored and download this movie without big expectations and you know what... I LOVED IT. And I hate the fact that I can't watch it in 3D. Don't ever listen to the others especially haters. I did not get so much pleasure from the movie for a long time. It's classic Sci-Fi of high quality with action, spellbinding love story and of course fantastic sceneries. Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum play so well that the air sparks from their chemistry. Though the idea of the harvest and price of the time is not the newest but still not so shabby as others in Sk-Fi and has lots of ways of development.  P.S. And I want to express special thanks to the customers. During the filming no one gram of Channing Tatum's sexiness was killed with shapeless loose overalls.Loved it! Firstly I have never written a review on here but after reading so many bad reviews I created an account just so I could defend this film! I really loved it! I love science fiction/Fantasy stories, pure escapism is what I am looking from in a film and this did exactly that. The story was brilliant and I loved the imagination it took to create the other world, the film didn't treat the audience like morons and explain everything excessively. It was exciting, imaginative and beautiful. I really don't know why so many people have put bad reviews on here. I would love it if they made more films from this story. I haven't seen a science fiction film as good as this in years!Beginning to End Fun Time From beginning to end, this movie had me glued. We went to see it in theater when it first came out and really wanted to see it because Mila Kunis is in it. Surprisingly this movie was fun to watch. I'm not much into Sci-Fi movies.  However, this one is really great because the storyline actually wasn't all over the place like other movies are. The action scenes are intense and the graphics were amazing. I really hope that they would make a sequel to this movie. I'm looking forward to it if they do come out with one. I am interested in knowing what happens to the characters. I wonder if this is a book? I would definitely pick this one up.A movie you need to see at least twice Jupiter Ascending is a great movie. You have to see it at least twice to get an understanding of the story line as it is so fast flowing. There is a lot involved and there are underlying plots that still need to be discovered. the action and special effects are very good but the story needs to be expanded further. It has a rich universe, a mixture of Dune and Dorsai. There is a lot that would be missed if you only watch it once. I feel this movie has been underrated by some as they do not understand it in full as the richness and the concept is refreshing, similar to how Riddick was at first. I sincerely hope that they explore and flesh out the universe and the story further.The Watchowskis' Descending Jupiter's Ascending is 2015's Battlefield Earth.Yes,It's that bad.What surprises me is that the directors of this film(The Watcowski brothers) are the same people that made the Matrix!The film has a a lot of problems.The plot is ridiculous,dumb and feels like a 12 year old came up with it.The dialogue is also aggressively stupid.If you thought that the main character Jupiter will be the next great female lead in Sci Fi you were wrong because she is underdeveloped(as every character in the film) and spends most of the film cleaning toilets and being saved by others.The film was also packed with awful performances by actors that are usually good like Channing Tatum,Sean Bean and an extremely bad performance by Academy Award Winner Eddie Redmayne.Worth mentioning are the bad visuals despite the fact that the movie's budget is 170 million dollars.Usually I don't like to say only bad things about movie's and I try to find quality points in them but this film has nothing to enjoy except that it is so bad that it is kinda hilarious.too much for one film good film, cast.i just felt it was too much for one film it felt rushed. if you like si-fi with attractive actors and no story arc then this is the film for you. the acting is decent with a-list talent but the overall story fells like another generic 21st century film trying to to find an audiences.A Hot Mess Its a shame this movie is a hot mess because the basic story idea is an interesting one. The character arc for Kunis' Jupiter doesn't work. She's goes from cleaning toilets to falling from skyscrapers to debating intergalactic politics with barely a gasp. She's the movie's eye candy and then they dress her in a long sleeve plaid shirt. The 'good guy's' heroism is nothing more than 'I can drive my spaceship really fast through the bad guys'. The DMV queen sequence is the middle of the movie is too farcical and cartoonish, it falls flat. There were some good ideas but the execution and direction doomed this movie to failure. Oh, and Mila Kunis can't act.Painful and that is it. I will start my review by saying one thing...DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! I know it looks really great and it was made by the Wachowski Brothers and they made The Matrix which was one of the best sci fi films ever made. Sadly though after making a movie going in the territory of Terminator 2 and other great sci fi films they have slipped into Battlefield Earth territory.  Okay maybe this movie is not as bad as Battlefield Earth but it is almost as unwatchable. This movie didn't just bore me with uninteresting characters and a too multi-layered plot but it angered me with its sense of not wanting to be original in any way. Some of the aspects of films it ripped off were so noticeable that I think the directors just copied those aspects. Sometimes these aspects were major parts of the movie and that easily could annoy anyone who loved the movies they ripped. Anyway originality or not aside the film is also very poorly acted by Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum and(I am not joking here) EDDIE REDMAYNE of all Oscar winners. The characters are boring and uninteresting and it doesn't help that the movie doesn't really seem to be trying to make it interesting. The plot is mixed and at times in some way repetitive and hard to follow. The concepts were sometimes in a way promising but never delivered anything interesting. I also felt that Mila Kunis's character, Jupiter Jones(Yes that is her name), was very weak and always needed saving.  Overall Jupiter Ascending is probably one of the worst sci fi films ever for being not original, terribly written and lazily acted which easily gives it a 1/4.So bad it's good or just plain bad? At this point no one will be going into this movie thinking they're seeing anything spectacular. Most, like I did, will go in wanting to just enjoy a few hours of crazy,stupid nonsense for a bit of a laugh. But does it live up to the 'so bad it's good' status? On balance, I think so. Now I watched this with a few drinks in me so my recollection of the already incomprehensible plot is not the best so I won't recount it here. All I really remember at this point are lots of overly long and over-the-top action sequences, painstakingly bad exposition and 'funny' dialogue and the campest overperformance of the century by one Eddie Redmayne. He really is the star of this dumpster fire and I laughed hard every time he and his jelly like lip movements came on screen. Overall, I did enjoy it for all the wrong reasons, as I'd been hoping, and still maintain that while the Wachowski's don't always make 'good' stuff, it's almost always entertaining in some way. This is true junk food and is the sort of thing to watch when you really want to just check out for an evening. As such, it's hard to give it a fair rating; just know what to expect going in and you'll enjoy it for the sheer ridiculousness it pumps into your eyeballs.It's like the kid with unrealized potential who burns out turns to a life of drugs... This movie has the same problem that David Lynch's Dune had: great actors and directors with a great backdrop reading a so-so script cut into pieces by the producers needed to trim time and a studio wanting a fast buck. The Wachowski's are great directors, but the scope of what they were trying to achieve here is too big for just two hours. If they had given this a full 5 seasons in a television series to run its course with a limited budget and less well-known cast, I think we could have had another Babylon 5-like success. Instead we got this movie, which in spite of all the boundless potential that this story could have offered, decided to flame out in explosive, Jovian glory. So, why the 4 out of 10? The actors were decent in spite of it all, and while this movie is terrible, I actually want to see this universe fleshed out in a reboot or re-imagining of this story. On a side note, stop creating spaceships with multiple, exposed and intricate moving parts. It might look pretty to a graphic designer, but to the engineer it's stupid in the highest order. The fewer moving parts, the less-likely it would be to break down, be damaged, or experience performance drop off. These new spaceships would fall out of the sky in a matter of minutes.The queen is scrubbing toilets Who would have thought that the monarch of earth is a poor immigrant from the Ukraine in the USA barely getting by as a maid and scrubbing toilets of the rich and richer. Yet a whole lot of aliens are interested in match stick girl Mila Kunis because she's got royal DNA. It turns out that a whole lot of aliens and they're God-like creatures compared to where we are on the evolutionary scale. One of those interested in here is futuristic space soldier Channing Tatum who has none of those wolf like tendencies though he is part wolf. But not the pejorative kind of wolf, Mila has royal DNA and he treats her as the princess she is. He's also got himself a pair of magic boots that enable him to fly just like Superman. During the course of Jupiter Ascending we learn about the earth's greater history including what happened to the dinosaurs and what could happen if an unscrupulous family gets a hold of the Earth. One of them, Douglas Booth an outer space Snidely Whiplash almost marries Kunis. This film has pretensions to be Star Wars, but it reminds me more of that classic episode from Married With Children where little green aliens come to steal Al Bundy's socks. And in the end when the good guys win I kind of think that Mila Kunis might as Queen of the Earth would have exercised a few more royal prerogatives than she did.The Wachowskis continue their descent into cinematic irrelevance JUPITER ASCENDING sees the Wachoski siblings continuing their descent into cinematic irrelevance following SPEED RACER and CLOUD ATLAS; the latter of those wasn't too awful, just bland, while SPEED RACER was astonishingly bad. JUPITER ASCENDING falls somewhere between those two definitions; it's a sprawling would-be science fiction epic chock-full of trite dialogue and clich√©d characters who seem to think they're in STAR WARS or something. There are two main problems with the production. The writing is choppy and messy, with characters feeling bland and weak, no more than one-dimensional in the case of the consistently overrated Channing Tatum. The direction is very poor, particularly so in the endless action sequences, filled with CGI effects that do nothing for the viewer, and shot in a shaky, badly-edited fashion so that it's difficult to make out what you're supposed to be seeing. Mila Kunis is an unlikeable and unsympathetic lead and Eddie Redmayne makes for a ham-fisted villain. The only one who comes out of this with his head held high is the reliable Sean Bean, and even he doesn't have that much screen time.Awesome movie: Humanity is Family! This movie is about family. It's Lassie in space. It's about hope for our world, in that someone cares enough about the goodness of humanity on earth to save it. It's about limitless possibilities, wealth beyond imagining, and how love conquers all. Consider the vastness of the Universe, consider all the unknowns. Consider one day an immensely powerful space-faring race decides our fate. Are we merely a resource to be harvested or are we more. It will be the Jupiter Jones-types who will show them we're worth saving with family values, love, care, empathy and selflessness. If all they see in us are the nasty, greedy, selfish tyrant trolls who rape the earth and subjugate others for the almighty dollar, we're as good as scorched. Dig deep my friends into your own humanity, find wonder, verisimilitude and splendor in all you see, whether they are insightful bumblebees or a werewolf with wings -- this is a much better movie than haters make it out to be. Now all we need is a sequel.A movie you can only watch to make fun of it and even than it becomes annoying Jupiter Ascending is a movie that was made. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes made by Hollywood. But let's judge my own judgments for a bit now. Lilly Wachowski and Lana Wachowski - the sisters that directed all three of the Matrix movies and the Cloud Atlas movies made this. So by now you would think that their understanding of the space and time concept would be way better then any one else. But it isn't. The movie is full of cheesy lines and the most irritating "What does it all mean" moments. It is filled with actors over acting to make those cheesy lines work. Eddie Redmayne after signing on to 'The Theory of Everything' and 'The Danish Girl' decided to do this movie. But not just that. They got Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum and Sean Bean too!!! I gave them three stars just because they were able to get this cast to sign up for such a script.  You might go into this movie thinking the cast might make things a little better. But they don't. Every single dialogue said with seriousness is laughable. You can tell your friends that this is a comedy and add some background music before you show it to them and they will say this is the best cheesy comedy ever.The only positive thing about the film is Mila Kunis being in it The title says it all. Really nice and spectacular trailers, big letdown. Story could have been so nice, but no, they had to include stuff that could have filled at least 6 hours into a 2 hours long movie, and the basic concept of the story being very interesting, after that it is just a piece of you know what, oddly cut and put together, you cannot fully understand the story line, nothing makes sense and there is no continuity. You keep getting introduced to new and new characters just so they can put in another explosion filled nonsense clich√© action scene. Tons of FXs, and some horrible final story that a 6 year old writes as a homework essay. Typical American movie. Such a letdown. The only thing that kept me watching through the whole movie, was literally Mila Kunis nothing more. It says in the movie, that when you realize the vast space and vast amount of resources of space, you will come to the conclusion that the only thing you will ever need more of is time. Well I won't ever get that 2 hours back from my life that I spent watching this movie. And the film got me so angry I spent 20 minutes just to submit this review because the IMDb review system is also a piece of you know what that throws up random errors. Peace.Satirical state of the art Sci-Fi grossly underrated This satirical story pushes the notions of ownership, legacy, profit and more generally capitalism to the extreme, all warped up into a state of the art sci-fi production. The costumes, designs and settings are original and beautiful, and the soundtrack really makes it kind of a space opera. Although many critics single out the acting, the actors actually makes every single characters credible. For instance, Channing Tatum plays a character whose species normally needs a pack to thrives, and the distant acting performance needed to convey his situation was somewhat reproached to him, which is pretty much nonsensical. Like any Wachowski movie, action sequences are perfectly performed, totaling about 20 minutes long in eight sequences (the last one is the longest, 12 minutes long). The story line is simple and yet original and provocative, with a delightful underlying satirical component to it (although this movie isn't particularly presented as a satire, it really is one). In my opinion, this movie is grossly underrated, not unlike Terry Gilliam's Brazil (this is no coincidence he plays a small role in it).What makes a good Movie? And does this movie have it? I read a few reviews of Jupiter Ascending, and I was amazed that so many bad reviews existed. I actually watched the movie first. I don't remember seeing any previews or commercials for this movie, or maybe they was out of sync with what the movie was really about. While I was watching I just kept thinking 'why haven't I heard about this movie before?' It was late at night, after work, and I was just looking for a fantasy movie to watch before bed and this showed up. The title and the cover weren't all that catching, but I couldn't find anything better. Fast Forward to the end of the movie... I want more. I want sooo much more I can't stand the thought of not having a second one. All of the reviews go crazy over the fact that stuff wasn't explained here, and what does that mean there, and how does this even work. Well here's my opinion. I want a prequel for Caine! I want to see his backstory, I want to know more about what happened to him that led him to Earth to meet up with Jupiter. I want to KNOW EVERYTHING. You know what else I want, I want to see more stuff explained in a sequel. We will see more actual politics and negotiating as Jupiter takes her place in the Universe. I want to find out if she DOES do anything about the harvests. I want to know if her and Caine get married or have kids. I want to know what happens to Stinger and Titus, and Kalique.  This movie is like the first book of a series. It leaves so many questions about the fictional universe that you devour the books as fast as you can to learn as much as you can.  Even if Hollywood, and Rotten Tomatoes, and whoever else hates it or criticizes it for being this or that. I just want everyone who liked it and the Writers, Directors, and Actors to know that I loved it and if it were a book series, or if there were sequels, I would totally drag my whole family and friends along to see it. I already have a movie night planned where me and my friends are going to watch it together. I love the Universe, and the neat way things are explained and the interesting genetic stuff that is going on in the story. Siscal and Ebert(Spelling?) can kiss my little toushe, cause this movie ROCKED!! *This movie contains exclusive sci-fi views, opinions, and explanations. It has not been copied from past movies or ideas. This content is new and fresh, viewer discretion is advised.*What a waste of time/Warning: Spoilers OK, the movie is visually stunning but one kind of expects that from the Wachowski siblings. A lot of the reviews show that nearly everyone was impressed, some even gave the move 7 stars only for the visuals. That I can't understand. You don't watch a movie for 2 hours just because of the CGI. I gave the movie 3 stars only for the visuals. There should be a at least a little bit of a convincing plot and actors who can actually act. I somehow made it through the whole two hours but that's two hours of my life I will never get back. To think that I even considered buying the Blu-ray makes me shiver. I saw it on German pay-TV, so it was included in my subscription. After about 30 or 40 minutes into the movie I kind of prayed that someone would kill off the main characters and the story would evolve with Sean Bean as the leading man. His talent was absolutely wasted. Channing Tatum - I've never yet seen a movie that convinced me he has even remotely some talent as an actor. Most of the times I couldn't bring myself to watch his movies until the end. Now I know it was the right decision. Mila Kunis - it was the first movie with her that I saw and she looked like she wanted to be somewhere else or she just didn't care about her performance. SPOILER: And the ending - sure, after all I saw and went through all I want to do is go back to earth and scrub some stranger's toilets again??? I really hope they don't think about a sequel. That money should be invested otherwise. My advice - just don't watch that annoying movie. Still feel sorry for Sean Bean, he's one of my favorite actors.It's descent.. Jupiter Ascending is directed by the people who directed The Matrix and how the hell did this movie turned out to be so boring? it starts good with some action and the next 50 minutes i believe? is all people talking in different rooms or different galaxies then the film turns into some action and facing the bad guy who i think was OK. But having 2 actors that people don't like that much like Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis you know that you won't win the audience and a script that is 50/50 out of it's place. Sean Bean tho if you expected him to die guess what he doesn't and he's probably the best character out of the film? But in the end it was just an OK movie if you're drunk or bored. I give it a 6.5Blunt as a rice wafer but with action, spectacular effects and Sean Bean in it. I can't believe this came from the same people who did The Matrix and V for Vendetta. Being a big Wachowskis fan I felt embarrassed to watch this film till the end. But I did. The special effects were spectacular and that was about it. The characters were caricatures, there was no depth to them and their lines were so boring they made me roll my eyes. So, Jupiter (Mila Kunis) gets kidnapped, almost killed, promoted to Queen, discovers that the earth is being used to "cultivate" humans for consumption and her acting is "oh, just another day". She just gets to move around a lot. There was no soul to the main character, no spark. The only thing that made me think that the film had potential was when Sean Bean first appeared and started explaining to Kunis how we humans came from Orion, inhabited the earth hundreds of thousands of years ago and mated with other species (Neanderthals apparently). At that point I thought the film was going to be about the origins of humankind but, nope, it was about a couple of brats trying to get cleaner-queen of the earth Kunis to hand over the planet to them. That was a very high budget film and the actors were good which makes it even more of a shame for its wasted potential.Not as bad as all that - Mila Kunis redeems it This is the first film I've seen with Mila Kunis. All I knew about her came from the tabloid media's coverage of her teeney-bopper romances with other teen heart throbs. She surprised me by how well she could act. It was an engaging performance that carried the film, which overall wasn't that great. Too many new science-fiction films over rely on cgi-special effects and poorly placed 'action' events. Fortunately, when you watch a movie on DVD you can fast forward through the tedium of overly long scenes of explosions, gory battles, etc. It doesn't give anything away to note that there is a Cinderella theme in the plot. I was tickled by the screenwriters' humorous twist on this.Pretty bad Jupiter Ascending was quite a bad movie. The script and the story were incoherent. Too much weird stuff happening without good explanations. Some of the scifi stuff, like the lizards with wings were too much. They were just there to be cannon fodder for our soulless hero. The filmmakers probably tried to add tension, since a big hulking lizard is a tougher opponent than just normal human right? Wrong. None of the action scenes had any emotional charge or excitement what so ever. Thanks to our lifeless characters, who are basically invulnerable. The acting was pretty bad for the most part. Eddie Redmayne, who certainly can act, was absolutely terrible. Maybe he was told to use an annoyingly slow and silent voice, but nonetheless his performance was painful to watch. And the other two Abrasax siblings were just as bad. Mila Kunis was quite annoying, starting right from the opening narration. She did get better towards the end though. Channing Tatum wasn't that good either. Only glimmer of hope was Sean Bean. The exposition via Sean Bean's character about 45 minutes into the movie, was the only time when I was even remotely interested in the story. Soundtrack was pretty much nonexistent. Nothing to remember. The movie is filled with special effects. They were extravagant I'll give them that, but they were not good. There were just so much stuff happening during every action scene and it was just so, well, messy. The hovercraft chase scene was absolutely ridiculous. Random CGI things exploding without context doesn't equal excitement. Sometimes less is more.You can't polish a turd. I don't know if I actually cared about the events taking place in Jupiter Ascending or if I wasn't completely paying attention. It was a bit of both. I lost interest very quickly for a number of reasons. First and foremost, JA is a cold, hollow movie. The dialogue's heavy and clunky, leads Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum feel the blow. Kunis isn't shocked to learn that she's intergalactic royalty, and Tatum spends most of his alien life skating the skies, avoiding enemy fire from those seeking to hurt Kunis.  Secondly the Wachowskis have tried too hard to create a piece of work that as unique as The Matrix. Much of film's time and effort is spent on how it looks, and it does look incredible, thanks to 99 shots out of 100 being computer generated. The actors are engulfed by it, chiefly Eddie Redmayne's ridiculous talking villain, who's hellbent on destroying Kunis just for being a greedy little planet hoarder. It's best to end on a high note, because not all's bad. In between the scant story is a couple of really joyful set-pieces. Both are sky battles, one at both ends of the film. They are thrilling, but not long lasting. There should be more of them, to give JA reason to have our utmost attention.Not as bad as most people say it is OK, it's not the "The Matrix" or "Cloud Atlas"... If people were expecting this to be as fabulous as them forget it, it's not... Nevertheless it's a great entertaining Sci-fi movie. The actors could be more in the skin of their characters. Sometimes they seem disassociated with them. And others seem to be playing in theater houses instead of cinema... The dialogues don't help also... I know it's hard to combine a huge and almost complete new Universe with screenplay, actors and set, and don't use CGI... so you have to give it a discount. But for the special effects, action scenes and plot in general (not the screenplay) I gave this movie a 7. Like I said don't expect much from this movie...i loved it! I don't understand why so many people hated it. I really enjoyed it. It was different and not in a bad way. The only thing i could have done without is the ending  spoiler below? I really could have done without him getting wings and her getting his flying boots and flying around the sky.. like .. OK what? that's just random and unnecessary. lol But overall like i would like to see more like this and kinda wish there was more to it. A new enemy? Her taking more of a role with owning the earth? People finding out about it somehow? I don't know but i liked the sci-fi romance and the feel to it. Although the controlling of the bees part was a little weird and kinda just thrown in there? I guess to try and make you know, OK, yeah.. she's royalty. We get it, they didn't really need that either. Unless she planned on to use that ability later, which she didn't Gimme more like this please!Good ideas, horrible execution. Jeez, what the hell happened? Now to their credit, the Wachowskis do have some skill as filmmakers, all credit due to their impressive work on flicks such as the Matrix trilogy and "V For Vendetta", the first of which revolutionized the world of cinema with not only some creative cinematography (like bullet-time), but also showing that action films can be thought-provoking. Yes, there was some stuff to pick apart and make fun of, but the effort is nonetheless admirable. But like all good filmmakers, they too fall prey to making a film that sucks the dignity out of their career and the one that perfectly embodies this is Jupiter Ascending. How bad is it?  Plot: Immigrant Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) has had a pretty uneventful, less-than pleasant life, always wanting more than just cleaning the homes of the wealthy. One day, however, that all changes when a genetically-engineered half human, half canine soldier named Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) saves her from deadly aliens and tells her that she is the rightful inheritor of planet Earth. Conspiring against her are three ancient siblings, who each want to take ownership of the world for their own sinister purposes. With Caine protecting her from all threats, Jupiter must travel a universe full of advanced technology and strange creatures to realize her destiny. Now, that plot simplification I just gave is the best I can do because the story is not only really complex but amazingly boring. There are scenes that seem to drag on for eternity even with all the flashy effects they put into this film. Some details take center stage over others that are more important or interesting and are likely to make you facepalm over the logic behind them. The filmmakers also feel the need to have the characters say lots of exposition rather than just showing you it, after all that's the point of a visual medium. Most of the characters themselves are duller than watching paint dry and do some pretty nonsensical things. The main villains, the Abrasax siblings, are nothing spectacular, especially Eddie Redmayne as Balem Abrasax, who is not only horribly acted but his dialogue is so mind-numbing he'll put you to sleep only to catch you off guard with the random laughably hammy outburst of his voice. Perhaps the most insulting thing about Jupiter Ascending is that it repeats plot points that were just used earlier in the film as if it thinks we have the shortest attention span, not that you'll be likely to get all the insane number of crammed details on the first viewing. I only found a few things to like in this film. The universe is a rather interesting with cool-looking space tech and many of the creatures have great designs. Some of the ideas presented are interesting and, having lots of potential, would have been more effective with a better script or story like the reason the Abrasax siblings want Earth so much. The action scenes are also good to watch, lots of cool moves performed, lasers firing, ships flying. The best fight scene involves these awesome dragon creatures, the way they fly around chasing and battling the protagonists, easily being the best part of this crappy film. The main problems Jupiter Ascending suffers are that it fails to live up to its potential and it focused on areas that are not executed right or not focused enough. As the Nostalgia Critic puts it, it attempts to sound big rather than feel big. While there are technically worse movies out there, this is far from a crowning achievement of the Wachowskis. It makes the "Mega Shark vs" movies look like Oscar winners. Good luck getting through this film because it left nothing but a bad taste in my mouth.Soooo bad, it's fun. This movie is for hard core movie lovers. Plot, well don't get real picky about huge holes. Why is a really hot chick scrubbing toilets? Just roll with it, there are tons of other things to pick on too but it's just plain fun once you get past the super eee-vil bad guys who probably came from central casting in days gone by, but they follow all the bad guy rules. 1. Be completely bad, with no socially redeeming values. 2. Threaten everyone including minions who while three times the size and much more dangerous looking, still kow-tow to Mr. Eee-vil. 3. Never raise your voice, be quietly threatening. 4. Always come back in the end so the hero can save the day yet again. The hero, all he lacks is a white hat but he takes his shirt off enough to forgive him that minor mistake. Where did this guy learn to roller skate hundreds of feet in the air? It's just another example of roll with it, it's part of the picture that never gets explained. The heroine, Mila Kunis. The only reason I watched the movie to begin with was gorgeous, innocent, helpless, and invincible. A typical queen of the universe that also skates in midair AND still cleans toilets! What a combination. The CG effects and amazing and worth watching this movie that we called "a two punch hacker card" movie when I was in the Navy but it is fun and anyone who likes to be entertained without having to remember details or where the plot is going will enjoy this intergalactic "Perils of Pauline" and not regret the time lost.  I won't tell you to look for it, but if it's there don't avoid it.Great Visuals but lacking in Plot With much potential, it's unfortunate that Jupiter Ascending never really achieves altitude. Feeling underwritten and over edited, plots are brought up and abruptly discarded in favor of another action set-piece, of which there are too many, each too long. You'll be grateful for the mecha, just for a break from Tatum's anti-gravity rollerblades, a handy prop given more narrative centrality than its title character, who goes from scrubbing toilets to intergalactic politics while seeming equally baffled by both. And though there are promising moments, Kunis and Tatum exchanging long-suffering looks while navigating red tape that feels like a moment of camaraderie caught by accident‚Äîthe film never stops feeling apologetic for itself.Not Very Good I didn't expect much from this movie, and I didn't get much out of it. The whole thing is just kind of ridiculous. The story is all over the place, with new information about the world being introduced constantly. The lore could have been interesting if it wasn't so much wasn't crammed into such a small amount of time. It wasn't a short movie, but it felt rushed. The romantic relationship between Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis' characters was beyond clich√©. It was so unbelievable and I just didn't care. There was a particularly terrible piece of dialogue. After explain that he is more related to dogs than humans (even though he looks way more human), she replies with, "I love dogs." Such awful writing, and it even implies something pretty disgusting that I'm sure they weren't going for. The action wasn't impressive either. The best I can say about the movie is that it isn't terribly boring, but it is completely forgettable. Also, the ending is really bad. After her family saves up money to buy a telescope for her and randomly give it to her, she says she has a date but won't say with who. (Side note: The family members laughed way too much in this scene to be anywhere close to realistic. It felt like I was watching a bad Lifetime movie.) She acts like she wants to have a serious relationship with Tatum's character, but she can't introduce him to her family because he's part wolf, so it seems stupid of her to go around bragging about her date, presuming that she will have future dates with the same guy whom she can't introduce. Blah. 4/10Like a hidden rotten apple The movie has such good grafics and could've been a great one but hollywood did it again. The scipt is just the worst, trying to make a sciencefiction / action movie more apealing for women with love, drama and uncomfortable scenes of a ordinary life of a girl. With some extra gay scenes and afro american characters this would be perfecly PC. I wich they would go back to making movies for the story rather than making them for an audience.Good enjoyable sci film film - doesn't deserve the negative reviews! I don't get all the negative reviews for this film. It has action, decent acting, good sci fi effects and reasonable storyline. What I do see from some of the reviews is that some people appear to have lost the ability to just sit back and watch a film without constantly analysing and over analysing it. For goodness sake just watch a film for the fun of it! This is an enjoyable and very watchable film, I have watched it on repeats and don't bore of it, and the fact it has Channing Tatum in it is just the cherry on the top ;-)8th Time watching this movie, I will tell you why!. Yes it is a hot mess but only because there is so much going on! this is not for the faint of heart or slow thinkers! So you people that love Romantic Comedies do not judge this because it is not your cup of tea. Now to the real mess: The cast was very well picked! all the evil you can handle and one girl with a hero doing everything he can to write the wrongs into a right! I love this movie just because of the philosophy and that is why it did very, very, very well in CHINA! But it seems that someone paid some people to slap bad publicity to this movie because it came out along side other movies at the box office. Oligarchy of our country is saturated with thugs and mobsters with deep pockets controlling our entertainment and our industries thus why this movie tanked in the USA, Give this movie another chance and watch it completely! Do not miss a single moment because every second explains the next and the scenes are wrapped up so perfectly that you will figure out why they mentioned or combined certain takes. I commend the cast and crew of this movie! What a great writer! a great Producer and what a good director managing thousands of crew members to do this perfect movie! When you think about it I have seen near perfect graphics , sound and actors but terrible writing and cuts that I just gave 3 to 4 stars but this one did not lack any information! I am begging for a sequel because there are so many unanswered questions, like where is the base located that rebuilds catastrophes? I am also up in arms on the planets she owns! She supposedly owns the whole galaxy! And with the son dead she is in charge of all the production but chances are the other son and daughter is snatching it up and have become stuarts of her estate. The sequel will probably focus on us being cows for the slaughter again but this time the Son that died probably promised the whole earth would be processed to a large consortium of investors that will do anything to invade earth due to a contract that was made and not accomplished. So this would be very interesting what they will do and I hope the same writers are back on the sequel. Praying for this sequel that really needs to answer the questions we have from the last. Hopefully the second time around will grow an occult following that will then push for a orgin Story made into a TV show or cartoon. We can only hope.So much potential why not make 2 or 3 better films? There was enough multiple ideas to make a whole entire alternative universe and with good casting and character development it could be fun scary touching but they shoved it all ina film that is too long in the end. Lovely visuals costume design sets and some acting but i was really bored and felt like they wasted time, which was the whole point of the harvesting of humans just like scientology claims LOL. Too bad they didnt take a longer view and made 3 awesome well paced films...this failed for me. Aslo does the woman ha e to believe the last man she talks to like some female goodlookimg Trump PRESIDENT!?Not Very Good. Went to see this with my friends who were hyped to view it. We ended up leaving halfway through out of anger to watch the 2015 Spongebob Movie instead. May I add that the Spongebob movie was about one hundred times more entertaining than this film. Not saying that the Spongebob movie was high art, we just got more enjoyment with our money. Would not recommend, even if it was free. Disappointing and lack-luster to say the least.Hope and Heroism in a Dystopian Setting - Nice Futuristic Gadgets This film has a unique way of illustrating the future and has a rather dystopian feel to it. This is the interesting part though, inside this dystopian reality, a tale of hope, courage and heroism unfolds. The special effects are amazing, the futuristic gadgets total fun, a hero and a girl add a romantic aspect to it and there are a lot of space fights. Some of the action scenes were too long for my taste, but the story was thoroughly entertaining and I wish there was a sequel. The whole atmosphere of the movie reminded me "Thor: Rangarok", probably due to the dystopian setting.Brilliant! Thought the chemistry between the 2 leads was amazing, I believed it. I loved the film. I'd like a hero like him in my life.Retelling of a Cult Legend Godlike ancient aliens want to harvest all the humans on Earth to make space drugs and the hero of the tale save the planet, not with strength or intelligence but dumb luck and fetishistic sex appeal. It's an absurd story with fancy visuals. It also happens to be a retelling of the story of J.R. "Bob" Dobbs, the semi-divine figurehead of the church of the SubGenius. While aesthetically, Pierce Brosnan in 'Mars Attacks!' was much closer in appearance to "Bob", Mila Kunis's performance was much more in line with the personality and actions of "Bob"; No clue what's going on through the whole story. Interestingly, much like Pierce Brosnsan's character falls for a half dog, half Sara Jessica Parker in 'Mars Attacks!', Mila Kunis's character falls for a half dog, half Channing Tatum in this film! I'm unaware of half dog, half human relations within Subgenius lore, so the connection is fascinating. There is even a lesson about "Slack" squeezed in at the end that only studious members of the terrible cult of the Subgenius might comprehend. Our savior returns to Earth and continues her life as a janitor scrubbing toilets, despite knowing that she is royalty at the intergalactic level. She has found inner peace (or is just not thinking), and presumably, gets to bang the half dog, half Channing Tatum.A good story if you can read between the lines While movies like "Dunkirk" or "the last Jedi" are get hyped up to the air and actually not being a 5 star at all , this movie is getting so many negative reviews even though its far better than the 2 i stated. "The Matrix" was a great trilogy, for the most people because of the , to that time, state of the art SFX but what the movies really were saying was for the ones being into old occult histories, conspiracy theories and modern philosophers chasing the answer "who i am, where i come from, why i am here, where i go" if you were able to read between the lines... Same is to this movie. If you re more into the topic, beyond "Ancient Aliens", you really might get much more out of the movie than "ridiculous fighting scenes of a man dog and a dude skating through the air"....honestly, is it more ridiculous than the figures in "justice league" or "Avengers"?  To me i have found this movie quite interesting, bit cheesy here and there, but definitely not a "waste of time". 10 stars? of course not, maybe a 6 or 7, but i give it a 10 just to give some credits back for such a underrated, entertaining movie with a thoughtful story.Don't be discouraged by the ratings here. It is a great film. I have known about this film for a while but I was not interested in seeing it due to the mostly low ratings it got. Zapping through my TV channels one day, I saw a part of it and it seemed ok. Therefore, I decided to read user reviews not just looking at the average rating. The I saw some people claiming it to be a good movei. Then, I decided to see it. I am very glad I did.The CGI is quite good, actually... ...but that's all this movie has going for it...it is entertaining, in it's own way, but a virtually non-existent story drags the movie down from the beginning. A script would have been nice too, but apparently the actors were thrown in to sink or swim on their own... No, it does not have any coherent story line to hold onto...in fact, you'll find it very hard to understand at all...BUT, it does entertain, and that is what movies are supposed to do... So, give it a try. Believe it or not, the movie does have some stunning scenes in there...Jumbled and Juvenile, yet Joyous for 10 year olds. Upon second watching, (with my daughters, this time) I realised this was basically a Children's film in disguise. My 10 and 8 year old loved it. They have watched it twice now and were rooting for the eponymous "Jupe" from start to finish. Although the bramble patch that doubled for a story kept my children asking questions all the way through... I mean, seriously... What the hell, Wachowskis? This was not your finest storytelling hour. From an Adult's standpoint, this film is a mess from start to finish... Whisking the viewer from stunning set-piece scene to stunning scene to a cottage in the countryside... To the centre of a maelstrom...  Set against a grandiose and splendid background, the story comes across as irrevocably insipid and weak, all but overpowered by the looming shadows of the fabulously powerful galaxy the sisters created. Moreover, the "plot" moves on so quickly that the audience are unable to form connections with any of the characters or settings. Any characterisations that are there, are shallow and the outcome is pretty obvious from the get go. Which is a crying shame since the sumptuous, no expenses spared sets and clearly well thought out Galactic milieu were tantalising us with its beauty and implied depth... It was crystal clear that the sisters had worked hard on building a galaxy with a deep, sordid history far too long and far too out of control and crowded for comfort... A backdrop that would have been perfect for an epic story to be set in. Instead, I have to ask... to what purpose did they create this? It just seems such an egregious waste of resources and effort for a story so simple as to be second rate. I can honestly only assume it was initially meant to be series but then something went wrong and the entire first season was compressed into a 2 hour mashup of sadly missed potential. Like the single "filmisode" versions of Shogun and V in the 80's. Impossible and pointless. This easily had the opportunity of becoming something akin to Luc Besson's 5th Element or the rich tapestry of Star Wars or as I mentioned, a whole, new series. Instead we were offered a pedestrian plot with non stop, escalating fight scenes and a really cringeworthy "love" story... and a skating alien!!! My daughters really want to watch it again!  I give it a seven for effort but broken down as below: Adult: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ Drunk Adult: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ Kids: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜA surprisingly good film Though the film is confusing to begin one (and reason for losing 1 rating) when you get into it, it's a very good film.  The beginning should explain more and give a short back story to the who's and why's. Because of the lack of, you find you'll spend the first 20 minutes head scratching and wondering what the hell is going on instead of enjoying the film. This will also put a lot of people off and no doubt has translated into such a low score. Here's hoping they do a directors cut and sort that issue out as this is definitely a film with sequels written all over it. Without ruining the film for anyone who hasn't yet seen it, if you enjoy sci-fi, along with a bit of romance, a lot of action and a few morals thrown in, you will enjoy this film. Acting, editing and directing are all top notch. Visually stunning though a few cgi moments does ruin the moment during a few scenes. Definitely deserves a second viewing (think The Matrix or Highlander and the "uh?" factor when you first saw them)Surprisingly awesome! Not a massive fan of syfy myself but felt compelled to write this. I have read a few reviews on various sites about this movie and thought i'd give it a go. I read a previous review here that said a whole bunch of stuff about character development etc blah blah, however as i already stated, "not a massive syfy fan", i thought this movie was excellent!. If you are looking for the next Matrix or Alien or Riddick then this isn't for you. This is a movie "type" i remember from my youth, where the story makes the characters not the other way around. If you are old enough to remember Krull then you will know what i mean. Movies used to be all about the story and action, where the "hero" became the hero during the movie and not "built up" in pre-story character development (as did all other characters within the movie), basically the characters became part of the story and not the other way around. This is one of those movies. A breath of fresh air in my opinion. CGI loaded? yes. Good acting? more than good enough. Good story? most defo. If syfy is your thing and you just want to be entertained then this is ideal. Enjoy :)A teen fanfic with expensive budget Where should I start? Since the beginning of movie nothing makes sense. A guy dies, a woman giving birth in a ship, so the baby is already Mila Kunis and she is abducted, and then appears monsters, bizarre creatures, bad guys, explosions. This its all. The script has the philosophical depth of a saucer, but it takes itself to seriously and is so pompous that becoming an involuntary comedy, full of bad taste moments. Just look the name of the girl protagonist. Jupiter f.u.c.k.i.n.g Jones. Are you kidding me? Worst fictional name that I ever seen. If I didn't know this came from a Hollywood movie I could swear that name was taken from a fanfic written by a preteen.When Jupiter Ascends, the Wachowskis descend. First off, this movie is not good. There is literally only one good thing about this movie. Some of the effects/action scenes are MEDIOCRE. Starting with the plot, Jupiter is a young woman/illegal alien from Russia who is apparently the reincarnation of a monarch that died AFTER she was born, or was it before? Oh well, not that I cared anyways. Basically after the bounty hunters were brought in from the monarchs children to find the mother's reincarnation, we meet Channing Tatum, who plays Cain Wise. A man who was an experiment by the government, and has dog-like senses, and yet, as proved at the end of the movie, it's revealed he once had wings? So they do some stuff, meet a guy, PROVE THAT BEES CAN SENSE ROYALTY EVEN IF IT IS A HUMAN REINCARNATION OF A LITERAL ALIEN, and meet two of the children. The daughter, reveals how they prolong their life, via special moisturizer, and the son reveals how this moisturizer is made, with humans, and not the dead kind. Basically the son tries to marry the reincarnation of his mother(just go along with it) and Caine and the guy we met from earlier stop the wedding because "I love you" and "He's going to kill you after the wedding". So they meet the second son, who has Jupiter's mean family and will let them go if Jupiter gives him Earth. So action scene #40 happens and creepo bro admits that HE KILLED THE MOTHER! (You get 5 extra points if A: you were genuinely surprised, or B: you still care) and he gets shot in the nuts two times. So the brother dies, Jupiter becomes queen of Earth, and I want to die. So yes, it is that bad.A bold try to make an epic science fiction fantasy Seen at the 2015 Gerardmer Film Festival. The first half is entertaining and has a sensational action piece to bid. While remaining visually stunning, the film flattens down and loses itself in lazy Hollywood clich√©s: Lame love story, one dimensional characters, bad one liners. The main plot feels completely dashed. Even Ned Stark can't save the disaster.  We tend to be OK with a film that starts bad and gets good along. But a movie that starts good to finally let you down with lazy writing is just frustrating. After the awesome "Cloud Atlas", this feels like a big disappointment. J.&amp; A.Several stars short of a constellation. Jupiter Ascending is simply disappointing. The Wachowskis' latest film is confused, creative, crazed, colourful and contradictory: the original promise squandered by schlocky re-hashes of the directors' back-catalogue and a heroine irrelevant to the hole-filled plot. Giacchino's pomp and circumstance score would fit the intended space opera. Sadly the only opera here is in the hammy acting, with Tatum and Kunis leading the cast in befuddled looks whilst mumbling unintelligible exposition. Visually Jupiter regains some stars. The extensive world- (even galaxy-) building is highly impressive, but without a worthwhile population and purpose to fill it, this creation is left devastatingly empty. Jupiter Ascending is several stars short of a constellation. An excess of imagination fails to result in entertainment or narrative cohesion; something went very wrong here. First published on One Room With A View http://oneroomwithaview.com/2015/02/03/jupiter-ascending-review/Jupiter Descends rather than Ascends. I had a privilege to attend the premiere of "Jupiter Ascending" at the Chinese Theater in Hollywood where I got to meet the co-director Lana Wachowski and I briefly had a chance to greet Mila Kunis, and that was a fun experience, but that was more satisfying than the film itself... I don't know where to begin because this film was a big mess! First of all The Wachowskis have a talent for visuals and they never fail at that and I have to say their only good film is "The Matrix (1999)" and not the sequels, just the first one. Everything they made after was just all style over substance and with "Jupiter Ascending", it has style, but substance is absent. The story has been done to death and painfully, obviously borrows the "plot" of "Star Wars (1977)" with the style of "Dune (1984)". There were some cool and well done entertaining action sequences in the film, but they became repetitive as the film kept going. The performances were actually quite solid from Kunis and Tatum, but Redmayne was very, very over the top. Overall the script was weak, not even the cool visuals can save this film and one of the main problems with the film was that they didn't even have fun making it! Space operas should be fun whether it's good or bad like "The Last Starfighter (1984)". With a budget of $175 million, this could be this generations "Waterworld (1995)". Even "Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)" did a better "Star Wars film than this. The Wachowskis have proved again they're a one-hit wonder, so Jupiter Descends rather than Ascends... Also if you do go see it, please DO NOT pay to see this in 3D! There was nothing 3D about it like most tent-pole films that come out these days! So glad I saw this for free!Shockingly awful, I walked out halfway through - and I'm a cheap bastard! Here's an opportunity to save you $$$! A movie review! Don't waste your money on seeing the movie Jupiter Ascending. I'm pretty forgiving of most movies, particular Sci-Fi - but there comes a point when you have to evaluate the value of your time vs. what you paid for the ticket. In this case I struggled to make in half-way through and couldn't take it anymore. Picked up my stuff and got myself out of there. One would have thought that a Sci-Fi made by the Wachowskis (of Matrix fame), would be at least tolerable. If nothing else it stars Mila Kunis (for the guys), and Channing Tatum (for the ladies), but even they weren't enough to help this stinker. Not even worth the price of a RedBox rental, which it certainly be in no time. At least I salvaged 1 hour of my weekend from being wasted.Amazing overlooked movie. In all honesty, this movie scored a 9/10 for me, but I'm giving it 10, because in comparison to what some people have given it, it's totally unfair. First of all, the whole 1D character remarks are unfounded. This is a story told on the run, there isn't room to give you intimate details of each and every character and this doesn't for one second detract from the great story. It's visually spectacular and that's underrating it. Very impressive spacecraft designs, technology, suits, jet packs you name it. Very nice. The story is most straight forward but something many folks are missing is the way it actually explains an awful lot as the movie progresses. The whole grey alien fiasco is nicely incorporated and explained very well. The almost Vampire style story of the upper echelons of the hierachy that rule the universe was stunning. Ultimately there's only one thing I didn't like about this movie and that was the ending which was rather lame after such an action packed stunning movie but it didn't get to me, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie, I was just hoping for a bigger ending and felt that the ending provided was something of an OK scene but not footage for the finale. (So here's hoping the Blu-ray edition features some alternate endings with much more satisfying grander appeal). This was a great look into an interesting thought provoking and imaginative future. That to me is what this movie was ultimately about, it wasn't a drama to highlight characters(which is sadly what too many people want in a movie. Well to that all I can say, is that your just sounding old people and there's nothing wrong with great ideas all tied together in action. What can I say, go and watch 'Days Of Our Lives' or something if all you want is character depths and dramatisations, some of us enjoy action movies and don't require every single detail of the characters bath room visits explained to us to deepen the character, our imaginations do the work for us). To conclude, this is a movie for people who love Science Fiction and are not afrais of using there imaginations. It's a movie for those who don't require details about everything and can handle amazing visuals(which tell a thousand words but are too often lost to audiences with expectations set on character hash outs and ultimately picked the wrong kind of movie to go and see). Enjoy it for what it is. A different kind of space opera. A refreshing and interesting one. Perhaps the problem is people can only handle Star Wars and everything that came after is just not doing it for them, because they want it all like the one they first discovered and can handle, but ultimately, there should be universes like this one, to push our imaginations further and give us different takes on being human and giving unique visions of humanity in space. Go and enjoy it Sci-Fi fans, it's terrific.Stunning! Ridiculous. A parody and and a work of art. Jupiter Ascending Review (there are some small spoilers - nothing major): I'm in 2 minds about this film. Firstly it works in 3D, really well IMO. Visually it's the best looking film I've ever seen! Music was good, but was a rip off in places of Hans Zimmer, Bear McCreary and a few others. Still I like all their stuff, so I'm fine with it. The film is pretty enjoyable and is paced and edited pretty well. There are loads of homages to many, many films from the last 100 years. At one point I thought I was watching Brazil. Then low and behold Terry Gilliam turns up! There are bits nicked straight from Blade Runner. There is a Ray Harryhausen bit for about 3 seconds. Eddie Redmand is playing Emperor Ming / Caligula. There are bit that are nicked from Cinderella, Superman, Caligula, Terminator, Aliens, all the Star Wars films (the costumes of Cinderella, sorry Jupiter are a mickey take of Amidala in Star Wars Episode 1) Flash Gordon, James Bond (the bad guy live in the Red Spot on Jupiter, not a hollowed out volcano), Gladiator (the baddies are 1000000000 year old Roman Dynasty), Dune, Prometheus, Spiderman (the surfer), Predator, Bat Man, Tron Legacy, Fifth Element, Game of Thrones, a bit the was like ET, Close Encounters, another scene with little green men in a corn field (Signs and probably a few other Alien Abduction Movies), and probably a zillion others! It was like a cut'n'paste of every film that you like, FFS! There were quite a few in references. Mila Kunis is on the poster in the clinic, the voice of the life support. A few others I forgot. So to elaborate my 2 minds: On one hand it's the most visually stunning film I've ever seen. I'd liken it to seeing Star Wars the first time, or Avatar. On the other it was pretty derivative stuff. May be that's unfair, as they were more homages. There are some interesting concepts though. Such as in an infinite universe, mankind would have infinite resources at his disposal. So the only thing of value would be his time. And he would do anything to get more of it. The film is complete in it's ending, but I can see them doing another if it does well. It actually needs a sequel, as there are enough subplots to explore. The film is totally bonkers, yes it's a mess, but I liked it all the same! Overall - go see it! (9/10)so bad I couldn't finish it I went into this movie knowing it would be awful. I mean, after all it stars Mila Kunis. If that's not the sign of a bad movie I don't know what is! Her acting is ALWAYS atrocious and she doesn't disappoint here. About halfway through, couldn't take her acting anymore, had to turn it off. Thought the effects would be enough to keep me watching but it felt like I was watching a video game. Those gravity boots might appeal to the 13 year old skateboard crowd but just looked silly to me. Stinger! Really!!!! You actually named one of your characters Stinger? Were Cobra and Spike already taken? Other reviewers commented on the villain overacting, I would call it lack of acting.
A fantastic sci-fi experience I very rarely write reviews for movies, but after watching Tomorrowland I've never seen a movie that's been so unfairly maligned by negative reviews,especially considering that this movie was an absolute joy from beginning to end. After watching it, and reading truly horrible, reviews I'm starting to think that somebody hired a few live bodies to slate this movie for their own specific reasons.  The script, actors and directors captured the feeling of endless possibilities perfectly. The FX were fantastic, there were no lulls in the plot, George Clooney did his thing perfectly, the child actors were incredible, and there were just enough twists and turns to maintain the pace. Please, please watch this movie and make your own mind up - the negative reviews almost put me off, but I'm so glad I actually took the chance.  Actually there's one proviso here - and is probably something consistent with most of the negative reviews: If you lack imagination, or the yearning for a better world, then you'll hate this movie. Or you want to raise kids who aspire to be nothing more than reality TV actors. Or if you're a reality TV actor. Or your kids can't read or write because you don't think it's important. Or if you think science is dumb. Or if you can't embrace hope. As for me...I loved it. I'll be watching it again and again :-)One of the best movies of 2015, and now on my "favourite movie" list.Do not listen to the critics on this one! A vastly under-appreciated tale of promise and hope. This film deserved so much more than what it got, both critically and commercially, when it debuted back in May, where unfortunately it ended up becoming one of the year's biggest box-office bombs. From the mind of one of today's greatest directors, Brad Bird, the same great filmmaker that gave us some of the best animated films of all-time like 'The Iron Giant' and 'The Incredibles' and the best 'Mission Impossible' film to date in 'Ghost Protocol', 'Tomorrowland' is an inspiring original story that above all promotes the two things that have been lacking in today's cynical society; hope and the promise of a bright future. Some have accused this film of being preachy for promoting these exact morals. But if you ask me, that just makes this film even stronger as a result in how it boldly goes against the cynical mindset that you see a lot of nowadays in favor of an optimistic vision of a better tomorrow. Bird and co-writer Damon Lindelof make the right decision to not over-rely too much on the world of Tomorrowland. This film may be centered around a fantastic utopia where anything is possible but it's more about the journey to Tomorrowland than the place itself and the build-up leading into the film's finale is second to none. Ultimately though it was the finale of the film that made it such a polarizing flick amongst critics. But contrary to popular opinion, I thought it was suitable for what the story demanded.  In a year where characters like Furiosa are being regarded as some of the greatest film characters of their time, this film features two of the best female leads of the year, played perfectly by Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy, respectively. As lead Casey, Robertson perfectly conveys the character's optimistic outlook without coming off as annoying while Cassidy shines in the role of the totally bad-ass robot Athena. George Clooney is also excellent in the role of an inventor named Frank who, compared to Casey, is much more pessimistic about the future but gradually regains his faith over the course of the film.  Don't let this film become one of those forgotten box-office bombs just because it dared to critique the cynicism of today's society. With brilliant performances and visuals and messages that resonate more than ever nowadays, 'Tomorrowland' is easily the most underrated film of 2015 and another masterpiece from director Brad Bird.How to redefine imagination This movie really took a person's imagination to a whole new level. The story was interesting, and keeps a person engaged with what is happening. It was cool to see the power of imagination and how a simple thought could become something much bigger. Frank Walker, played by George Clooney, was recognized by his limitless imaginative capability. It was going to one day change the world as it is. He was able to do just that. Walker was a genius scientist who made a certain discovery about Tomorrowland that would hold the key to changing the world. With the help from Casey Newton, played by Britt Robertson, Walker was able to travel to the city and unravel what he had discovered so long ago. This movie has a simple story, and it is ideal for those with a creative and innovative imagination.Totally misunderstood I can't believe the bad reviews. I also can't believe that nobody understood what they accomplished with this film. It's Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged! They managed to take that book and bring it up to date while making it accessible to all ages. That is a fantastic feat in and of itself. To also make it really entertaining is extraordinary. Cerebral and action packed, it holds the attention of the young right to the end. And the end? The film was the pin that showed the audience what could be if only we don't give up and just make things better. Atlas Shrugged and then asked for help. Everybody should see this film. Now. Oh, ignore the comments about continuity. Does it really matter? Artistic licence anyone? Right my review is over but I have to keep writing because it won't post unless I fill the minimum line count.A spectacular Disney sci-fi thrill ride I went and saw this with an open mind because of the mixed response, and I must say I had a blast. The story is unique, creative and quite compelling. It is original science fiction which we do not get too often. The film is inspired by the Disney park, but at the same time, it's more of it's own thing. It is well acted and the characters are quite likable and believable. Frank Walker is interesting, entertaining and has a sense of humor. Casey is also an interesting character. I think George Clooney and Britt Robertson portrayed their leading roles very well. The film is also quite funny at times. During this film, I think I may have laughed more than I usually do at the movies, which is saying something. I think Brad Bird did a very goo job directing. The visuals are stunning and the special effects, while mostly CGI, are impressive. The action scenes are neat and intense. There is not a single moment where I was bored with the film. It also pays a nice homage to the Sci-fi genre. The one problem I had with this film is that I was expecting a little more of the "Tomorrowland" place and that the story needed a little more work. Overall, this was a great film and I highly recommend it to fans of science fiction. Plus, I think it totally puts "The Haunted Mansion" (2003) to shame. In the end, "Tomorowland" may not fully realize it's potential, but it should be satisfying as a fun and intriguing Disney family sci-fi/adventure comedy thrill ride.A great movie! I think this movie was fantastic. You should know what you are watching and who is the target audience and have the right mindset. For example if you are watching any of the Aliens you are looking for a bit of horror, thrill and some brutality; and if you are watching Avatar you are looking a hardcore mystery and thrill. I think Brad Bird did an amazing job for its target audience. When I watched it I was not expecting brutality, hardcore action or deep mystery, I was expecting good quality soft Sci-Fi. I think it did great to keep me extremely interested throughout the movie and the message of the film and its delivery was beautiful. Talking to and reading the reviews of those who didn't like it, I think they were expecting a Sci-Fi like Aliens, or Terminator which is like eating Coffee and Cookies for lunch! You'll not enjoy it because you have the wrong expectations! It's the problem of the consumer not the product. So the bottom line is, if you are looking for a beautiful soft inspirational Sci-Fi with an amazing direction that you can watch with your kids and teenagers and re-energize the dreamer in you, go for it! :)Misunderstood This movie is misunderstood, I'm writing my first review with the hope to increase understanding and appreciation of it. Lose your expectations and watch it as it is, an adventure. Think about the things you see, analyze them. Don't expect to be on the edge of your seat all the time from exciting action, it takes a back seat after the beginning.. which the trailer seems to mostly contain and make a false picture of the film. My opinion.. I try and keep this spoiler free. While perhaps expecting a little more awe scenes, action and insight into the "tomorrowland" society the movie has some very nice scenes. 2/3 into the film it somehow got a bit boring.. but it gets better. Could perhaps have been cut on a place or too, but the scenes were visually pleasing instead. A few confusing aspects here and there like the transition at the end, but who cares? No one has seemed to bother analyzing the philosophical aspects of pre-determination, alternate realities and concepts like our consciousness creating our reality as an reflection of our collective state of mind. The message is a fine one and something to think about our outlook on life. Does all the negativity really serve us? What's the content of news? Only negative stories. Do they encourage you to go out and make a difference or make you depressed and go on with business as usual it is all going to h*ll anyways? But it sells and is a money making mechanism.. It is a bit humorous the extent the level of fear the society in the movie are in and project unto the children and society, connections to our western society can be made too. If you notice these things you will appreciate the hints at secret societies and connections to the "Club 33" in Disneyland too and other goodies like the rivalry between Nikola Tesla and Edison. Nothing too profound or divulging from my understanding but it's there too, Tesla is an under appreciated figure in our history who deserves a lot more recognition. These are the things I brought with me from this movie, and I'm a sucker for scifi, which was what initially attracted me to the film, but it turned out to just be eye candy to boot :) not the main thing about the film.Upbeat positive story for the whole family. I looked forward to this movie since seeing the trailers. The stunning visual of Britt Roberts transported to an other worldly place, then George Clooney asking "do you want to go?". Seriously? Heck yea! Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic, but I enjoy stories that hold out the promise of adventure mixed with hope and some genuine magic. I was not disappointed. Tomorrowland hit all the right points with me--adventure, mystery, characters to love and root for, surprise story twists, laugh out loud moments, and, the best magic of all, hope. Saw it twice, second time with grand kids. I will be adding Tomorrowland to my Disney collection.Maybe a bit childish but enjoyable sci-fi tale none the less. A bit uneven and too long (It takes the movie about 30 minutes to really kick into gear). Otherwise I enjoyed the plot of slowly figuring out what is Tomorrowland and what's the purpose behind it all. So it's not a perfect film but a long way from the failure it's made out to be. Brad Bird doesn't disappoint. I have read quite a lot of negative comments about this movie and even its message and I find that to be slightly odd. From saying science should only concentrate on inventions instead of research to being annoyingly preachy. God forbid if a movie has a message these days and despite it having an agenda I thought the movie was fun and entertaining. I personally found the message of the movie to be pro-science and to fight the cynicism and apathy that makes it seem it's impossible to save the world from the direction we're going in. I usually feel there's no hope for the human race but I like to see movies that try to convince me otherwise and try to keep the small glimmer of hope alive.Excellent movie. Amazing creativity and imagination. The creativity and imagination that went into this movie is stunning. A great message about how positive and forward thinking can influence our futures and the futures of generations to come. The movie brought me back to my younger days when my imagination would make exciting dreams and made me think that anything was possible.  The characters were great and the scenery and colours were spectacular. I have never written a review before on this site, but after watching this movie I was inspired and felt impelled to give my comments, if only to encourage others to watch it. I remember watching Star Trek as a child and how imaginative it was with all the communication gadgets, most of which actually exist today. I wonder if many of the items seen in this movie will one day become reality as well, perhaps not in my lifetime, but with the advancement of technology and the imaginations of the creative people at Disney, who knows! All I know is that I don't agree with the critical reviews and will always form my own opinion.Captivating film I'll keep this relatively short. I'm a 60 year old, very hard to please Brit. This film, pleased me very much indeed. Hence, the 9 out of 10 score. Those who marked this film down, really do require a reality check. I'm not usually given to writing film reviews, but on seeing this film's current low rating - I felt compelled to write something positive, in its favour. The acting and special effects alone, stand on their own. The film, may well be 105 minutes long, but it's 105 of the best spent minutes I've had, this millennium. I won't delve into the film's storyline, as that has been adequately explained by others. If you want to be engagingly captivated, in a futuristic, make-believe World - where anything seems possible - then this is the film for you. I for one, would love to escape the current mess of a World we live in - to experience the alternative dimension, on offer, in Tomorrowland: A World BeyondA good fun movie with a message of hope So, before I get to the movie, a word about some of the negative reviews here. Wow, there are so many! I'm not sure if they saw the same movie as I did, or if they are all just devoid of a sense of wonder and fun, but there are an awful lot of people that really disliked this movie. Of course, when you read their "arguments" (I'll be generous and call them that), you realize that most of their discontent stems from the fact that they thought the movie was going to be something else entirely. I'm one of the most cynical and jaded moviegoers going and I'm always ready to rip a new celluloid butthole in any film that deserves it, but this film does not warrant some of the comments here. When I see people complaining this movie is too violent, or that it isn't a family movie, or any of the number of bemusing complaints, I wonder if they aren't exactly the kind of people that this movie warns its viewers about. Namely, those so obsessed with negativity, that they can't accept anything that is fun. This movie surprised me, because I had heard bad things about it and it was, in part, penned by Damon Lindelof, whose work it is fair to say I find by turns amusing (not in a good way) and irritating. I'm not sure how much of the story is down to him, but regardless, this counts as one of his better efforts in my book. So what will you get when you sit down to watch this movie? You'll get two hours or so of utterly harmless fun, aimed primarily at kids, but with enough more adult themes in it to entertain the adults among us. That said, it isn't at all offensive, or violent, and it isn't boring. It moves along at a decent pace. There are slower moments in it, but the action scenes move along briskly when they appear, and they appear quite often. Any violence on display at all is aimed squarely at robots. There is only one scene where I exclaimed out loud in surprise, because I wasn't expecting it at all, and that was when the little girl robot gets hit by a pickup truck out of nowhere. It's a bit of a shock, to be honest, but she is quickly shown to be unharmed by the incident. However, it might frighten some younger children for a moment, so be warned. I think a lot of the negativity this movie has received is down to the fact that at one point, the bad guy of the film (Hugh Laurie) spells out just how horrible people are and that their impending doom is entirely down to their own fault. There is a little speech that essentially blames people for their own lack of foresight and bone-idleness, which has led them to the brink of destruction. Now, I normally might find this sort of thing preachy and condescending, but it fits well in the context of the movie. However, some people, I think, aren't able to have fun poked at them and seem to have taken an unnecessary amount of offence at this, and taken it out on the movie as a whole. Despite this darker tone, the movie as a whole paints a hopeful vision, showing us that we can change our future if we really want to. The ending is a little cheesy, but it is a good kind of cheese, with the message that it is never too late to make a change. Overall, the movie is just a fun flick for kids and their parents. Older teens might be bored a little, but younger kids will love it. It isn't meant to be taken too seriously, but just enjoyed for what it is. Oh and for the person that suggested the movie was unsuitable for any child under fourteen, your kids have my sympathies. Oh my God! Their lives must be filled with so much cotton wool padding that they are perpetually on the verge of smothering to death. Good job! SUMMARY: Way more fun than its rating would have you believe. Generally harmless entertainment of a family nature. Don't take the negativity seriously, because the movie never takes itself seriously. Its fun, that's all there is to it.See this movie! Who would have thought that one of the most imaginative films of the last five years would be a film targeted at children? Tomorrowland was a pleasant surprise. There were a ton of really amazing scenes and a grand sense of scale. The cast is magnificent. George Clooney is great as always. However, it must be mentioned that Raffey Cassidy almost steals the show. She is definitely one to watch and as long as she avoids the pitfalls that go with fame, she is pretty much guaranteed a very bright future in the acting business. The story is compelling and has a good message -- without sounding preachy. Lots of great classic science fiction homages in here, plus plenty of very cool modern ideas. It was great to see three generations of future aesthetic in the same film. In general, the pacing is pretty good. There are a few parts where it drags a bit. It makes up for it in spades in the last half of the film. Editing was expertly done with plenty of quick reaction cuts between actors to thread things together neatly. As usual, Disney's shot choices are very good (very textbook actually) and the score suits the film nicely. Be sure to treat the kid(s) in your life (your children, nieces, nephews) and or course, yourself to this movie. It's one of the few modern family films that's actually genuinely enjoyable for all ages. Plus, you'll get to see some of Santiago Calatrava's more extravagant architecture.Why do people hate this movie? Don't listen to the haters giving this movie ones and twos, because this movie is phenomenal! This was my favorite Disney movie¬Ö before Inside Out came out (then it became my number two favorite). The characters are nice and fun with just enough screen time and character development to make them likable. The story: Brad Bird's GREATEST PREMISE since a Superhero family! The world is going to end because someone has implanted that idea into everyone's heads. So it is up to a girl with a great imagination and determination to save it. But the twist is the bad guy in this movie isn't George Clooney for making the device, or the Audio-Animatronic girl, or even Hugh Laurie. It's US. Because we didn't know any better, we didn't try to fight the idea of the end of the world. So, in a way, WE are the reason that this movie exists. I guess the only reason people hate on this movie is because of the continuity errors and the fact that they are the bad guys. Speaking of, this movie does have it's faults, but who cares when you have a great story and characters AND amazing special effects. And, yeah, the effects in this movie are beyond amazing. When I saw Tomorrowland for the first time, and the rocket in the Eiffel Tower, I was blown away! I saw the trailers and the effects made me gravitate towards this movie! And the trailer is probably another reason why people don't like this movie. The trailer made it look like an early preview for Star Wars 7. I was also expecting that, but when I saw the actual movie, the trailer didn't matter. So what if you didn't get a dumb action sci-Fi flick. You have a new original idea acted well, directed well, written well, and made at the right time that this movie should have been a hit! Tomorrowland: Disney's dream on the big screen, and I LOVE IT.The good, the bad, and the worst...our modern Wizard of Oz I will try to be simple: The good: Direction, original story, performance (especially the two young actresses), FX. A real jewel, and not only without a glitch, but with funny moments and action at every minute, or even, some of them, very touching. The bad: ... It's supposed to need to write something? OK: nothing at all. The worst: All the bad appreciation of critics which really have no good taste for art. A lot of people does not understand that the movie is not just about Tomorrowland, but about a journey inside the heart and will of the people... and with this, as if that was a small achievement, an odyssey. If you want to see a good exponent of the 7th art, don't hesitate to see this movie. If not, just listen some critics. ;) Additional comments: Some people say the movie has technical failures, but believe me, there are none, and the reason is because this movie returns to the most pure essence of Sci-Fi. Maybe some people does not liked because it touch sensible fibers about a very common and well known message, or maybe because they believe that it was only to promote a Disney attraction, but even if that was true, doesn't diminish the quality of the movie. A little childish, OK, the movie was intended for all the audience, and this is not a bad thing, in fact, is an incredible and amazing way about how to show the essence of something really beautiful. Finally, I see some comments about an over-acted Britt Robertson, but if you have seen some of her works before, maybe you can see that the little histrionism that she injected in her character is very intentional, and then you will see the talent of this great actress. "In a world where values, commitment, common sense, courage, curiosity, and thinking capacity are weakening, this movie is a beacon of hope for children... and adults too".One of the better ones lately The fact that this movie gets as many bad reviews and ratings as it does absolutely astonishes me, I'm very critical when it comes to movies with a "environmental message" like this, but I had no problem with it, it was delivered in a fun laid-back tone, and Clooney's performance was very sarcastic and cynical, I loved this movie for that reason. I don't watch Clooney often, but I'm happy he was in this. It simply tells a great story revealing "secrets" of the great minds of previous generations, and gives us plenty of back story and interesting laws that apply to "Tomorrowland"  5/7 would watch again.Brad Bird delivers a gem Sorry that this review is so late in the day. I have only just recently got around to seeing Tomorrowland. All the acting performances in this movie are wonderful and the humour is first rate. The soundtrack too is especially good. A great soundtrack improves a story enormously. I decided to turn on the subtitle channel on the DVD to follow all the dialogue and this also helps on the first viewing to follow the narrative better. I am supposed to type out a minimum of 10 lines according to the rules but to do this I would have to put some spoilers in and so therefore I am going to try and waffle for as long as possible to fill out because I do not wish to spoil anyone else's enjoyment of Tomorrowland.What a pleasant surprise. I watched the trailer for this and it seemed like way to many things were happening in this movie. This meant that when i had the time to sit down and relax to watch it, i changed my mind and watched Maze Runner - Scorch Trials instead. This is a mistake that should not be made as that was so bad i can barely describe it. Anyways i decided i would watch it even though the trailer was a mess, and what a pleasant surprise. It was not messy in any way and it got me hooked from very early on.  It has amazing visuals, great casting and a very meaningful story.  Rafael Cassidy (Athena) did an amazing job. At such a young age to pull off such a performance is rarely seen, and given the right chances she could be worth to follow through her career. Clooney is good but not spectacular as his character is not great in the beginning. He catches up though. Britt Robertson (Casey) also does great and is another one to watch in the future. The story is actually very timely and is something i reflected on after watching the movie. It heads off with some background story before nicely introducing us to the characters. I was hooked all the way as we follow Casey around though thick and thin.  Great movie and a bit low rated in my opinion. I would place it at 7.5 and therefore i give it the benefit of the limits with an 8.If you are wondering about negative reviews, don't I mean, don't be surprised.  Yes, Tomorrowland is a science fiction adventure of the highest grade, an unpredictable thrill ride of a movie, full of plot twists, jaw-dropping imagery, hauntingly beautiful music, and brilliant acting by major star power. Not to mention the great direction and editing that does not leave a spare second throughout its two hour length. Disney, ILM and Pixar. Lindelof and Bird. Clooney and Laurie, Robertson and Cassidy. Wood and Murch. Giacchino. Rule-breaking and ingenious, inspiring and fresh, this is a top notch entertainment from a top notch talent.  But it is more than all that. It is also a fable, a tale of two wolves. It makes its moral pretty clear. The thing is, people a fable is addressed to usually do not find it funny or cute. I wonder how many 'dumb', 'disappointing', 'preachy', 'pointless', 'boring', 'leftist propaganda', 'I fell asleep right when the Grasshopper...' Aesop was getting in his time.  That is why Tomorrowland was a very brave thing to do. It takes guts to make a movie where everything from start to finish very smartly, very carefully, very distinctly adds up to the core message 'negativity is a failure' -- and to release it in a world full of negative people. Wow. I get why they hate it. I can also see why Brad Bird skipped Star Wars to make it. Personally, I think it was worth it. Thanks, Brad!Separates the imaginative from the cynics, an inspired work by a true artist. Brad Bird has yet to let me down, this movie has divided audiences but the division is pretty much down to those who share the quality of imagination and creativity as opposed to those who have nurtured their cynicism to the point of interpreting everything as a negative. That basically is what this film is about in a nutshell, its made to inspire hope from the creative among us who are not living our potential due largely to the multitude of negativity, conflict and selfishness the human race seem to have become comfortable in wallowing in. If this film had been released 20 years ago, I might have never given up my previous profession of drawing comics for a living. This is the first movie that's ever made me reflect on my choices in life and feel ashamed that I "fed the wrong wolf" so to speak. If you have kids then take them to see this movie, inspire them to dream, create and be positive now more than ever. Ignore the critics and the negative reviews, this movie is nothing short of superb family fun with a message more important today than any film you'll probably ever see again. Brad Bird and Michael Garaccchino are the new Steven Spielberg and John Williams, the music in this film is outstanding and will stay with you long after you leave the theatre. This movie has earned a very special place in my heart and up there with Mad Max Fury Road for best movies of the year so far.Imaginative, dazzling , and great performances I went into this with somewhat low expectations, do to the poor box office. I was more than pleasantly surprised. It was visually amazing. The cinematography was so well done. A perfect combination of CGI and interesting set locations.  Acting and casting was superb. Britt Robertson is one of the most compelling young actresses. She has brought her A game to the big screen.  If you can get around the global warming nonsense that creeps into almost every film these days, Sort of like the cold war and Nuclear proliferation were in all of the films of the 60's and 70's., the plot is actually clever. I really enjoyed this picture and wish I had seen it in 3d. I think it may have a cult following in the futureChanging the world Please watch this movie, it has been given bad reviews unfairly, it warns people about our dying world but it does it in an entertaining way. When the world is doomed, what do you do? You'd try to alert people so they could take action to prevent the death of the world from happening, right? And how would you do it? With news stories? Scientific data? Good luck. Most people would rather turn a blind eye to any environmental issues and just watch Walking Dead reruns to get their minds off it. But what if there was a movie that was family friendly, had a great cast, and even had the Disney name attached to it? What if Hugh Laurie had a remarkable and compelling speech which tried to get the message out to as many people as possible to get their acts together? To save civilization, the movie would show it's collapse. But how do you think this movie was received? The ticket sales were lackluster, because everyone would rather watch the same kind of movie they'd seen a hundred times before. People didn't care to see something original, they wrote it off BECAUSE it was original! Critics, internet reviewers, right-wing conservatives, all defecated upon this movie, and told people it was a waste of time. Meanwhile, the movie was actually a hidden gem. An entertaining film with a powerful message, but nobody cared to see it! And because nobody wanted to watch it, the message went unheard by so many. In every moment, there is the possibility of a better future, where people get off their lazy asses and actually take action to improve something! Learning a new skill, planting trees to make the air cleaner, spending time with their families, inventing new technology! But people would rather resign themselves to a boring future where they never do anything of value for one reason: Because it's easier. The future where we've solved world hunger, ended prejudice, and achieved world peace is hard. Achievable, but hard. And the future where everyone is a lazy glutton that does nothing but eat pizza and watch TV all day is easy. So yes. We saw there was a problem, and we tried to warn people. But they just ignored this warning like all the others. Why? Because they want to be lazy. They gave up. And it's not the movie's fault if it's not striking a cord with you, it's yours.Powerful. Inspiring. Let's think and build a wonderful future This is one of the best of the best from Disney. It does the job. It delivers what ALL ART is supposed to be about. This is why Disney is what it is, and why this movie is a 10 out of 10. This movie is a beautiful beam of light in this world. I can't recommend it enough. It has love, hope, optimism, science, wisdom and forward thinking. I absolutely loved it. I have enjoyed every second of it. This movie also came in a perfect time, it is very up lifting. Life becomes what WE think of it. Let's think of a wonderful future. Let's build it together. BE the change you wish to see in the world. BE the change you wish to see in the world. BE the change you wish to see in the world. Think of a wonderful future. Let's build it together.Visually stunning retro sci-fi In an age of dark, grim visions of the future Disney's Tomorrowland is a delightful throwback to upbeat adventures of the 60s and 80s, a retro sci-fi film for the whole family to enjoy. Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is a bright and optimistic high school student who does not share the pessimistic views of elders. When Casey discovers a mysterious pin that shows her fantastic world and sets out to find the futuristic city with the help of a jaded inventor, Frank Walker (George Clooney) and Athena (Raffey Cassidy), an English-accented Audio-Animatronics. Tomorrowland is a deliberately old-fashioned film both its tone and visuals: the film was loosely based on the Disney ride of the same name - considering that Disney were able to turn Pirates of the Caribbean into a billion dollar film series. Bird was a wise choice to direct and co-write, The Incredibles had a 60s style sci-fi look to it and he brought that look to Tomorrowland. It was bright and colourful with its showing of various technologies, from robots, jetpacks, lasers and a steampunk rocket. Brad Bird has already shown himself to be a capable action director with Mission Impossible: Ghost Portrayal and with Tomorrowland he had much better CGI. There are some cool fight sequences, especially with Athena - it is awesome to see a little girl beating up fully grown men and giant robots. Tomorrowland is visually spectacular especially when we get to see the city in all its glory for the first time. Bird certainly brought out a sense of awe, whimsy and wonder. Tomorrowland also has a great trio in the leads: Clooney, Robertson and Cassidy are terrific together, having many witty moments together when they are travelling and there is a zip in their interactions, like when they use a knock-out tool. Although Robertson's look too old to be a high schooler she pushes off the necessary enthusiasm. But it was Cassidy who stole the show: she was a revelation as Athena, playing a character who was older than she actually looked and at times acts a Terminator. She personally reminded me of Saoirse Ronan when she was younger, just with dark hair. Although Tomorrowland had a talented director at the helm it also had a screenplay with Damon Lindelof's fingerprints, a man who has poor reputation as a screenwriter. As an adventure Tomorrowland is excellent but when it goes to the science fiction the film gets bogged down with mumbo-jumbo about time particles and destiny. This part needed to be expanded and more refined. When it's revealed that Tomorrowland was a place for exceptional people to come to where they would not disrupted by government or civil society. Essentially this is similar to Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, a controversial sci-fi work that abdicates the philosophy of Objectivism, or if you prefer it's the ideology of Andrew Ryan in Bioshock. The prologue at the 1964 World's Fair could have been cut and it would have made the reveals more impactful. Tomorrowland is a good of romp of a film, providing plenty of laughs, action and visual spectcle. It was rated a 12A in the UK but it is on lower scale of that rating and could easily be enjoyed by children younger than that age.10/10 you are all crazy Poor poor film, too many bots giving 10/10 and a "fantastic sci fi experience" im not being paid so i can tell you its rubbish.I Was So Excited! And Then... My father was an aerospace engineer for NASA, in New Orleans in the 1960s. You can see why I was so excited to see this film. Finally, I thought, all of our hopes and dreams for the Space Age put into a film capsule, all of the ideas--even the classic jet pack! Then, CGI took over, and Hollywood's new penchant for shocking the viewer with POV character tumbles and other violence that would leave a normal human being incapacitated--if not altogether decapitated. Long story short, after my father lied to my mother and us children and said he had been laid off from NASA instead of taking his promotion in Seattle, which was the truth, I began to hate Science and Sci-Fi--a hatred that grew inside of me year by year. But, I always held a soft spot for Ray Bradbury's imagination, and this film looked like it would bring all of the disparate ideas and concepts together--and with a precocious lad and cute girl to boot. How could we miss? But, we did. Will Disney try again? I hope not. They get progressively worse as the years and decades go by. In any case, unless you thrive only on wild color and swiftly moving cameras jerking this way and that, skip this one. It promises so much, but it never delivers. I'd be willing to bet Ron Howard could do far better with the Space Age. Agree?Disappointing So much potential - what a disappointment. It was like watching an over-rehearsed play Or an episode of "Hannah Montana". Even Miley Cyrus bailed on that show. The future scenes were htonderful but ioo brief. I haven't seen a George Clooney film I liked - why do people think this guy can act? He just talks angrily through his roles, as if he was woken up from a nap, before his scene. WisdomsHammer gave an astute analyses on this movie's short comings. And Remco de Groot summarized it well "Most of the time the movie gave the vibe of one of those promo films that are often run while you are waiting in line of a amusement park attraction. We were waiting for the doors to swing open and to be instructed to enter the trolleys and fasten seat-belts. Pins are for sale for $3.75 at the exit." Actually a pin would be cool - I'd rather have one than endured this disappointment. Ending on a positive note, as mentioned by others, the actress playing Athena was splendid.I can't hate this movie... Look, I know a lot of stuff about this movie doesn't work. It can be tonally awkward, the pacing near the end gets really slow and the dialogue can get a little weird.  But... doggonit, I can't hate this movie! It's just so optimistic and fun that I can sort of look past even the parts that it doesn't do well. Give this one a chance and at least watch it once.Come all ye dreamers This movie is hard to rate. It is full of drawbacks as well as wonders.  There'll be some spoilers First -the wonders. Always good to see Hugh Laurie, especially in his House MD style) Charming fellow, Hugh Laurie, lights up every movie he's in.  Athena is also very bright and brings the famous AI theme into the movie. Some Terminator II inspired scenes, namely the car chase, Spielberg-like AI dramatic finale - the finale was very touching, although I would prefer her to stay with the team.  All interesting and strong scenes are actually the second part of the screen time so if you give it a chance, it goes better with every minute, and the last 20 minutes are particularly good. And the drawbacks... Britt Robertson screams a lot. Starting with an independent headstrong rebel clad in leather on a motorbike - sexy style) She was made into somewhat too hysterical then, Rebel turned into the kid in distress? Not a good idea. Retro scenes were too cartoonish and candy-like. The grandeur of the City of Science was completely undeveloped - the only ideas were flying trains and multi-storey swimming pools.  Overall the movie had sort of a personality disorder, trying to be kids movie and a sci-fi drama. Yet it developed into quite an interesting show with the deep meaning underneath - which reminds me of earlier Disney movies of 80s and 90s.  Good Disney movie definitely worth of watching) Feed the right wolf, as they've used to say in it))Entertaining and fascinating but has some problems Who didn't have a fantasy about a place like Tomorrowland as a kid ? I know I did and for that reason this film was fun to watch and was entertaining. However, I had to overlook a few things to make it so. One glaring issue to me was Britt Robertson. Her character reminded me of when I watched The 70's show on TV and anytime the actress playing Donna made an appearance, I would say to myself "she not a high school student, she's a college girl". And so, the same was for Britt. She does not look like a teenager in this at all even though she plays one. BUT, I was able to suspend my disbelief to get through a very good performance and a happy story. The other thing that played a role in all this is George Clooney who makes no secret of his political views. I enjoyed his performance a lot and I believe he was cast perfectly for this role BUT I was sure that there was a "message" that this movie had since he was in it. There it was toward the end of the film - the same bs we keep hearing from the Lamestream Media and the presstitutes they employ. Finally, as another reviewer pointed out, once again parents and adults are portrayed as less intelligent than teenagers. This is a continuing trend in entertainment that began a long time ago. It has become so prevalent that one can easily overlook that fact when watching product made in Hollywood. Aside from these observations, the movie was paced well, had some great special effects, catered to my childhood dream of a fantastic world that was possible and did not have gratuitous sex or violence.Great Adventure Piece Filled With Interesting Themes When I first saw the trailer for "Tomorrowland", I was intrigued by the mysterious premise and the promise of adventure. It delivered on both accounts. For a basic plot summary, "Tomorrowland" tells the story of a number of different individuals who are introduced to the alternative-universe of Tomorrowland. A young Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson) just wants to be an inventor, and he is ushered into the strange new world by Athena (Raffey Cassidy). It seems like he has is entire, exciting life as an inventor planned out for him. Fast-forward a number of years and Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is feeling stifled by a family life and school life that isn't challenging her enough. She stumbles across a pin that, when touched, transports her to Tomorrowland for short periods. Intrigued, Casey begins to investigate further, coming into contact with Athena herself and a sour, cynical, grown-up Frank (George Clooney). Casey and the gang are pursued by some shady forces too, proving that perhaps Tomorrowland isn't quite as angelic or benevolent as it may seem. The strongest facet of this film is that it simply is a great adventure piece. The characters are interesting enough to make you care, the visuals are spectacular (I'd recommend IMAX, as it truly was stunning), and the pacing is perfect. It's been quite some time since I've enjoyed a rollicking adventure like this without rolling my eyes. Another strong suit to "Tomorrowland" is that it contains enough futuristic themes to hook in more sophisticated viewers. Yes, it is made by Disney, and no, there isn't any questionable content, but this isn't a "kids movie" because, in all honesty, it deals with many of the same themes that "Interstellar" covered in its own more adult way. Simply put, "Tomorrowland" is the type of movie that an entire family can enjoy. It has adventure, humor, drama, interesting themes, and likable characters. The bottom line on this flick is that it is just great, entertaining cinema fun. Yet, it isn't "mindless fun" by a long shot, as the themes explored are ones that people of all ages can relate to. Highly recommended in all formats and for all cinema-goers.Disney Pixar Presents "Tomorrowland" George Cluney agreed that this movie was considered a flop as it not make in royalties to cover the film's budget . The cast and crew were fabulous. Another Disney Pixar Epic adventure . Somehow the plot was lacking . And the Screenplay was not by Screen Gems. The director went to work as usual with what he had to work with in storytelling was missing something . Disney was over budget on a low budget film . Thank you SAG - AFTRA . Deserves a GP rating by the motion picture association of America. Filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada . The Scenery as well as the film's special effects are breathtaking. The film's director and Producer deserve a nomination for 2015 Best Film at the Oscars. As 2015 had quite a few memorable film's .Future Turgid Optimism! That seems to be the lesson, mantra and chief narrative band-aid of Brad Bird's very earnest, occasionally preachy and ultimately kinda dull retro-futuristic sci-fi family action adventure comedy... thing. The visuals are impressive, and set to a pleasingly derivative Michael Giacchino (doing his best John Williams impersonation) score. And the cast is certainly game; particularly Britt Robertson, who manages to resuscitate this flat-lining story more than once with her likable feistiness. But despite its pure gee-whiz! DNA, 'Tomorrowland' just ends up feeling like a $200 million version of those old buy the world a Coke commercials from the 70s.Enjoyable movie, with something lacking in the story writing I had been wanting to see this movie for awhile after viewing the trailers long ago. In some ways it was better than I thought it would be. The acting and filming was superb, and I think the director did a good job, although I saw there were nitpickers complaining about things not being exactly right here and there. That does not ruin a movie for me. There were some fun action sequences and I really enjoyed the unexpected addition of the little girl, Athena, who was not in the trailers. Putting children in pivotal lead roles really worked for me in a movie showing us a future world and I thought Clooney and Laurie worked well with the unusual cast set up. I think the two areas that fell flat for me was something lacking in the story writing and the lack of a clearly defined evil or villain. What was lacking in the story? I am not sure, but without it, this movie will not be that memorable except that I will remember those two talented young actresses, that part of the movie took place in Disneyland and that Clooney and Laurie were in the movie, which indeed did help me want to see it in the first place.We all know George Clooney? This movie is directed by Brad Bird who did Pixar movies such as The Incredibles. He is a smart director and he did a good job on directing this movie. I liked where he was going with it, but he missed the mark on completing a perfect movie. With that being said, have you noticed the direction of George Clooney's movies? Anti war? Anti big brother? Let's work together and build Utopia? Stop global warming? Stop violence? Stop killing Mother Earth? Well that is what this movie is all about all rolled in to one giant shell. The special effects are cool and I enjoyed the movie from that point of view but there are some silly leaps of logic in the script and I wasn't about to leap where these writers wanted me to leap. Too many illogical assumptions. Too many flaws. Case in point. You have a young, brilliant woman who is trying to save her father's job by disrupting the dismantling of the launch tower at NASA. She rides in with her motor cycle at night, tricks the cameras, then jumps the fence to do some sabotage. The movie wants you to believe that this sort of thing is valid. That destroying property that isn't your property is righteous. Next we are to believe that she is taken to the local sheriff office with out being taken by NASA security to be interrogated. Then the FBI? Then the CIA? They would have her so deep in a hole that he father wouldn't know if she was alive or dead. In fact I'm betting they would raid the house, take all the electronics, computers, they take her brother and interrogate him too. Totally illogical. They could have done better with the writing. There are other parts of the movie which are completely flawed but that is completely typical of Hollywood these days. They don't perfect stuff because they only want to pump out movies for profit. So what about the message of this movie? The message is that we are all consumed by feeding our egos. They didn't come right out and say it but that is what they meant to say. We feed our ego by feeding it with greed, hate and fear. When we aren't scientists, artists or engineers we are destroying stuff. We are mindless sheep for the slaughter. We don't care what happens. Well for the most part, they are right. The idiots of this world are mindless sheep and a majority of the people use greed, hate and fear to motivate decisions. With that being said, most of the rest of the movie is cool. I didn't get the little store in Texas which was setup so that people would travel there to sell their little pins. That was ridiculous. No. It was ludicrous. What an absolutely dumb part of the movie. I also have a problem with the character Casey Newton who is obviously bi-polar. This character shows amazing scientific ability and is able to create, fix and imagine almost anything. Yet when she runs from the store where she tried to sell the pin she goes in to panic mode which I find out of character. Instead of being logical and controlled she flips out when Athena shows her that she is an A.A. (Audio Animatronic) robot. She has just had her life saved and she totally wigs out stealing a truck and running away. This entire 15 minutes of the movie is wrong, from the time she gets the idea to go to Houston to the moment she is dumped out of the truck in front of Frank Walker's house. Other than these flaws I could live with the movie. 5/10 stars because of the lack of attention to detail.fundamental problem Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) sabotages his father Eddie (Tim McGraw)'s work site. He's dismantling the NASA launch site and losing his job. She gets arrested and given a pin which transports to another world. Athena (Raffey Cassidy) is a robot who guides her to Frank Walker (George Clooney). Back in 1964 at the New York World Fair, Frank eagerly shows Nix (Hugh Laurie) his backpack and Athena picks him to join them in the other world. This is visually beautiful. The switch between worlds is amazingly done. I love that section of discovery. There is some fun chemistry between Clooney, Robertson and Cassidy. The action is exciting. The movie would work great if it doesn't some fundamental problems. Damon Lindelof and Brad Bird have created a world where the dreamers are being held back by everybody else. It reminds me of the rhetoric of makers and takers. It reminds me of Atlas Shrugged. It's a very badly simplify vision of reality. The movie could have fixed it by making it a dystopia alternate world. It should be a much darker world of war, famine, and destruction. Lindelof and Bird are trying to make a point about our modern world but the point is off. Damon Lindelof himself partakes in the dystopian fixation and humankind has always been fascinated with the concept. The apocalypse is not a recent invention. There is an opening ten minutes section where Clooney and Robertson are doing some kind of blog. It reveals Clooney's backstory and introduces the other world. That should be eliminated and Clooney can tell her about his story after she meets him at his house. Robertson's discovery of the pin and the other world would be even more wonderous.George Clooney plays George Clooney George Clooney plays George Clooney as usual, what else could you ask for? The film also has some pleasantly thought-provoking themes that left me wondering whether the villain was truly evil or not. To add to this, the ultimate message of optimism that shines throughout the film is something lacking somewhat in films these days, and really makes this one stand out from the crowd in the glut of super-high budget family films that have been produced in the last few years. Now, important to add is that this is very much a kids' film. So maybe not an appropriate film to see with your college or work mates on a night out. And naturally, don't go and see this expecting masterful, subtle storytelling or realistic dialogue. The story and dialogue are both unabashedly silly, but quite frankly, why on earth would anyone care? Don't go in expecting a storytelling masterpiece. Honestly, just sit back, let down your critical barriers and enjoy the magic of cinema. And one more thing: If you're reading this in time, this is DEFINITELY a film to see in the cinema while you can. Get the benefit of the big screen and surround sound while you can.The First Dent In The Unblemished Filmmaking Career Of Brad Bird. Despite being somewhat original in content, bursting with creative ideas &amp; packing in some exquisite set pieces, Tomorrowland marks the first dent in the so far unblemished career of Brad Bird, the genius mind behind classics like The Iron Giant, The Incredibles &amp; Ratatouille for the premise is pretty generic if one tries to look past the extensive CGI wonders it has in store and it isn't executed properly either. Tomorrowland tells the story of Frank Walker &amp; Casey Newton, former being a disillusioned genius inventor &amp; latter is a bright, optimistic teenage science enthusiast, who are brought together by a mysterious pin that offers a glimpse into a different world existing somewhere in space &amp; time, and ultimately embark on a venture to unearth the secrets of this enigmatic place, where their actions directly affect the world they live in. Co-written &amp; directed by Brad Bird, Tomorrowland is filled with gorgeous looking set pieces and the whole idea sounds very interesting on paper but the profundity of its sci-fi elements are often contrasted by the lack of depth in its narration &amp; characterisation. The characters' predicament is never felt, the plot at times becomes way too complex to follow, and it often gives off a vibe of a family entertainment yet never connects on an emotional level. Production design team deserves kudos for the wonderful, richly detailed &amp; intriguing world it puts on the screen. Cinematography makes slick use of its camera for the most part and Newton's first time in the wonderland is a highlight moment for the entire CGI-heavy scene is captured in one unbroken shot. Editing could have chopped off a few more minutes while Michael Giacchino's score has that feel of a new, exciting adventure but it's doesn't really uplifts the whole experience by much. Visual effects is undeniably spectacular and seamlessly integrated into the narrative. As far as performances go, the cast comprises of George Clooney, Hugh Laurie, Britt Robertson &amp; Raffey Cassidy but none of them leave a lasting impression. Clooney feels like a miscast in the role of Frank Walker, Laurie doesn't have much to do, Robertson delivers the best work of them all as Casey Newton even if her input isn't stunning by any means while Cassidy is in as a droid who assists Walker &amp; Newton with their mission. On an overall scale, Tomorrowland has its moments of wonder &amp; amazement but purely on the strength of its story &amp; narration, it's an unfortunate disappointment that's never able to get its act together in order to deliver a consistently entertaining &amp; wholly satisfying movie experience. Basically, it's the same tiresome concept of "the chosen one who gets to save the entire planet from complete annihilation" crap that we've witnessed so many times in so many sci-fi flicks, except that this time it comes sugarcoated with some brilliantly imagined set pieces. Watch it only if you want to.It's Disney's castle in the horizon This is Disney self-reference about the engineering of narratives to deliver a message to us about the value of engineering them. And narratives should always be construed broadly as the world in which they take shape, so this means the engineering of narrative worlds. A kid is seduced by a girl, one of those feisty princesses that populate Disney, into following her inside a themepark ride like something you'd see in one of Disney's parks. But the ride deviates from its course of established imagination, sending the kid to a hidden world (another themepark) below where the future is being engineered. The film proper is another ride that decades later takes a young girl all the way back to that hidden world to find where it all went wrong in our ability to imagine a better world. Along the way we get chases, lasergun fights, sci-fi hijinks, that's just the stuff that populate the ride.  A lot of it fun, and you'll note that all of it comes down to how we as viewers are thrust through a place that reveals how it was engineered to be, seen more clearly in the race through Clooney's house revealing various contraptions built in the walls. It's the same logic behind themeparks of course. But it's the message I want to come back to. Unpacked from the film, it goes a bit like this. The world is in a bad place now, with a doomsday clock counting down as the film begins, but it wasn't always bad. It was looking forward to a hopeful future once, this is given to us as some purer time in the 60s. (which is when the current generation still responsible for much of our cinematic imagination was coming of age - there was never a purer past except what childhood recalls) Later we find out that somewhere along the way the marvelous project of imagining the future was abandoned. Why? The discovery of a device that counts down to world end. The girl swoops inside the story so that we can see by her spontaneous nature that the device is predicting no such thing - it was only projecting a narrative in peoples' minds, a set of images much like what's on the news today. War, famine, displacement. The message that emerges is one of the most vital I know. See, instead of being awakened by these images to take charge of their future and alter course, people have succumbed to their illusion, believing them to be inevitable, which only serves to precipitate the end. The root of the problem was a stuck imagination fettered by images, given to us as a device that fosters a mechanical certainty that closes portals in the imagination.  This is all true in a deep sense. The angst we feel - and these are angsty times - comes from what we perceive partially and bundle into stories that we carry with us. You'll see this partial reality every time you open the news. Never anything about how millions of people had a perfectly ordinary day or fell in love today, only about what's broken. But will the people who need this message most - people stuck with the cynical habit of regurgitating what's wrong with the world because that's how far they can envision - see this in any other way than cynically? And is the best way to get this message in a movie where someone has to throw a bomb in the machine while robots fight below?  Indicative, the parting image shows kids being awakened in a field of a now unfettered imagination yet to a dim view of Disney's castle in the horizon.Preparation for a future with an omnipresent Artificial Intelligence. Somewhat entertaining. It is one of the many TV shows and films that look like a preparation for a future with an omnipresent Artificial Intelligence. Propagandist messaging is otherwise mild, tolerable. Interactions with robots were somewhat unhealthy, with elements of brainwashing. On line, we already interact with robots a lot, without knowing it. For many, robots are the only type of interaction in the future. Therefore, be cautious about it, on line, and in the real world. The film is somewhat entertaining. There are well done action scenes. The movie is a bit too long. The story line fails to engage you. The verdict: 1) Watchable, 2) Is it worth paying for? Up to you.Such Imagination Before I start to talk about this movie, I want to mention another topic that will relate to this movie. We all know that whenever we put on a movie on disk or even videotape that before the movie starts or even previews we always see these FBI Warnings about video piracy. A familiar scene we remember from when we were kids. The problem with video piracy, is movies are expensive to make and if they don't earn all the money they deserve, they can lose a lot of money. That could keep the studio from even making sequels, because they haven't earned enough money. I brought this up, because this movie did not earn a lot of money at the box-office. It was it's own original story, and was a box-office flop. I'm asking myself, if movies really need to have such expensive budgets? If a movie has a high budget, they probably think it will be a success, but not always. Like, Prince Of Persia Sands Of Time was supposed to be the new Pirates Of The Caribbean, but it didn't earn enough money, so we can scratch a sequel from that movie. But, even some low budget movies/productions at times seem to be well-done and really good. A few examples, let's think it's almost the Holiday Season so a lot of us will want to see Home Alone. That movie was the highest grossing movie of 1990. They originally had plans for other scenes like the nutcrackers coming to life in Kevin's dream. But, that was too expensive for the budget. It's still a great movie, and possibly even better without those scenes. Other recent low budget movies I liked: The Way Way Back, Earth To Echo, and Paper Towns. My favorite movie is a low budget movie and independent Canadian film called Junior High Spy. It had some bad acting, but still a well-thought out movie that entertains me more than any other movie. The kid actors in that movie also seem cooler than the kid actors we'd see in a Hollywood movie. Even with special effects, I watched Power Rangers as a kid which was using it's footage from Zyuranger. I'm watching Zyuranger years later, and hear it was a low budget production. But, I'd think it would have a higher budget, especially more than Power Rangers as the special effects came from that show. Also, they filmed in more public places in that show, including amusement parks. Zyuranger is a better series than Power Rangers. So, where have I been going? It's just I feel like movie studios could write the same kind of stories, but have easy ways on cutting back costs which could save them money, and still make an entertaining movie. I haven't heard that much about TomorrowLand. I did see trailers, and finally rented it from RedBox. While seeing it, I couldn't help but think wow. This will be like the most imaginative movie you'll ever see. It kept me entertained, I really enjoyed it and laughed at certain parts. It was definitely an entertaining movie. Some of the movie looked like Star Wars, and I thought the action in it was like action in Spy Kids.  What were some ways the movie went wrong where it wasn't as good as it could have been? I felt like the movie started out pretty cool, at least when the adventure started. But, after the adventure starts, the movie seems to take us in a different direction and we don't see as much as Casey's Dad and brother as we should have. I also felt that the movie plot was hard to understand. Still, the movie left us with a good message that the future is up to us. The special effects from this movie are totally astounding. They might make you think differently about this world.  In all, it had amazing special effects, but could have been a better story. The second half seems to focus more on the action and special effects than story. But, I'm sure this movie will keep you entertained the whole way through. I give it a 7/10.stuck between 6 and 7 The first hour is great! Amazing visuals, great action, good characters... no complaints. The film seems to have a good premise to start, but the last 45 minutes really fails to pull it all together and in the end it's the plot that is a little light. The meaning/intent is there, but the story- telling in the second-half wanes a bit, and everything that made the first 2/3rd's of the film great, goes missing down the stretch. I almost gave this a 7 anyway because the set-up and middle portions of the film are aces... really, really good stuff. I was 'pinned' to the screen for the first hour, and then with 10 minutes left in the film I was completely losing interest.  I'm still giving this a passing grade and mildly recommending it because the first half is just so great. Kid-friendly Sci-fi that starts this strong is hard to come by. Some good performances and a little humor helps the entire film. I could have used even less 'tomorrowland' and more real world with Raffey Cassidy and George Clooney.  It just seemed like a very intriguing story and state-of-the-art effects to start with, but fizzled to an anti-climactic ending. 64/100 this could actually hold onto a top 25 spot with the way this year has gone.Is not going to be a Disney Classic but the kids will like it Disney was trying really hard on this one. I have got to appreciate the visual elements of Tomorrowland which were top quality and what is probably expected when you throw $200 million into a film. However I felt the story was a bit disjointed and the acting like it had come straight from the Disney channel. The main female lead seemed like she had ADHD (which might have been true) I get that she had to be the optimistic character but you don't have to act like you have taken a hit of cocaine to look optimistic. Clooney did a good job as a grumpy old man....oh wait he is one already....so he did not have to really act on this film. And the longing look between Clooney and that robot girl were a little creepy at times. I think the story at the end went over my head and I am sure it will go over any children heads Visually top notch but the story and acting could have done with a little work. Also at the end I felt like I was watch an old Captain Planet episode when they were giving out the badges....oh look someone is planting a tree lets give him a badge....oh look some one looking after elephants lets give him a badge.....and when their powers combine GOOOOOO CAPTAIN PLANET!!!Terrific message. Commendable execution. There's no denying that our denial is what will steer our race into oblivion. Regardless of political undertones, the movie blatantly professes a positive message: worthy of the embrace it shall never receive, as our neolithic society has yet to evolve from its guilty pleasures of persecuting they who preach love and shaming they who inspire tolerance. Stuffed here and there with nifty acting and an abundance of budget, in terms of pure entertainment and visual spectacle I am unquestionably sold. The plot is relatively predictable, at most moments, but in no way poorly conceived. Exposition goes down the seemingly endless railway to Forever as is the case with several Disney films I have encountered in my short lifetime, but I can never say that these trips ever fail to construct their curiously marketable characters. Dash it, I am pretentiously nitpicking, and only in a blazing Inferno would that be customary of me. Watch this film. Mull on an armchair. Dodge that contrition sinking in. Let time patch your damages. Carry on living as you ever did. Fling some food in anger. Shower for an hour. Postscript: Take my word for it at your own risk. I have viewed this film a while back and can remember no more than a gist of it.The Vidiot Reviews.... Tomorrowland Walt Disney was an idealistic man who envisioned the not too distant future as a technologically advanced utopia where the white race reigned supreme. Luckily for any minorities in this sci-fi movie, his paradise didn't quite go as planned. When a prepubescent android (Raffey Cassidy) presents Casey (Britt Robertson) with a pin that temporarily transports her to a science based Shangri-La in a neighboring dimension, she yearns to return. However, the only way to do that is to partner with an exiled resident (George Clooney). With his know-how, Casey not only gets back but also learns from Tomorrowland's erudite leader (Hugh Laurie) that her reality is in peril. Imaginative and ambition, this adaptation of the Disney theme park ride doesn't skimp on special effects. But while it is visually appealing, its cautionary screenplay is more akin to an ecological guilt-trip.  Incidentally, Utopian societies designed by scientists have absolutely no churches.  Yellow LightDespite its many flaws, there's some refreshing escapism in Tomorrowland. Whether at the helm of an animation in both dimensions or a big franchise, Brad Bird has proved himself to be one of the most refreshing action directors in the industry. Why people doubted Tomorrowland so much even after the intriguing marketing was beyond me, though surely it mostly stemmed from a script from Damon Lindelof. Yes, there's merit in their criticisms, but there's also some merit in the film even if it can be derivative. It's not quite the next Spielbergian blockbuster for the ages, but at least it has a heart that many other big movies neglect. However, with that heart comes a heavy-handed message of which must have struck an irritated nerve in its guilt trip. Thankfully it's mostly isolated in a single monologue from Hugh Laurie and besides that and a clunky opening - which has a framing device that feels like such an afterthought to get George Clooney in the movie quicker - it's a pretty solid movie.  Otherwise, I'm quite glad the film traded Clooney off for the kids for the first half of the film. In the lead, Britt Robertson is a welcome new personality for Hollywood, like a more efficiently comic Jennifer Lawrence. A lot of the film's best moments come from the charm of its cast, especially when the core trio bicker, though I found Raffey Cassidy lacklustre until her character was justified. The complex relationship between her and Clooney's is fascinating but it's easy to see why it could make mainstream audiences uncomfortable. The film is very guilty of certain Lindelofisms with vagueness and loose mysteries but it grew on me steadily during the second act. There are certainly pacing issues where it's clear that they've had to pave over something deemed unusable. It's a mixed bag of strong hits and misses, but it never soars quite high or sinks too low, excluding its great score from Michael Giacchino. It's ultimately quite likable as a whole with some refreshing escapism. Bird's done better, and he will again in the future, namely The Incredibles 2. 6/10Ambitious, but Uneven! Brad Bird's 'Tomorrowland' is Ambitious, but Uneven! Though stunning to look at &amp; made with passion, this recent box-office dud, falls short in its Writing department. The narrative doesn't have the spark, one expected from it! 'Tomorrowland' Synopsis: Bound by a shared destiny, a teen bursting with scientific curiosity and a former boy-genius inventor embark on a mission to unearth the secrets of a place somewhere in time and space that exists in their collective memory. 'Tomorrowland' begins amazingly. The first-hour 20-minutes, especially, are wow. But, soon after, the pace drops. The energy drops. And sadly enough, it never pushes up. Damon Lindelof &amp; Bird's Screenplay is below the mark. While the premise is brilliant, the story however doesn't translate into a big-scale adventure. The second-hour is not engaging, while the climax also looks hurried. A much stronger Screenplay was most definitely needed!  Bird's Direction is dreamlike &amp; highly stylish (The Graphics are mind-blowing too), but his own Writing puts him down after a point. Claudio Miranda's Cinematography is faultless. Walter Murch &amp; Craig Wood's Editing is fine. Michael Giacchino's Score is impressive, as always. Production Design is top-class.  Performance-Wise: George Clooney is excellent. Even though the Icon has less screen-time in the first-hour, he takes charge later. Britt Robertson is competent, as well. Raffey Cassidy is first-rate. Hugh Laurie is wasted.  On the whole, 'Tomorrowland' is a body beautiful, minus soul.'Tomorrowland' should've been 'Yesterland' This film is about a parallel existence of earth which comprises of Intelligent people and their inventions. Recently, I saw this film named "Coherence" which dealt with the existence of Parallel universe and it took me by storm. This film did exactly the opposite. Disney does not concentrate on making quality films but it just pins its hope on entertaining. This film does exactly that. This film is just another entertainer with all the usual Sci-Fi elements and fancy gadgets, plainly this film has NOTHING which you haven't already seen. Brad Bird had done great work in entertainment before with films such as Ghost Protocol and The Incredibles but doesn't live up to their standards in this film. I was shocked to see George Clooney cast in this film whose role could've been done by any upcoming actor, I mean "Clooney !!!!! But Why !!!". The film does not kick off well and it immensely fails to keep the viewers hooked up till the end. This could've been easily under looked by almost everybody if not for Clooney,Disney and Brad Bird. The imagination of the writers can be appreciated for they have done a decent job and Disney spares no expense at the visual effects, it looks all right in all aspects. The Anti-Robots from Tomorrowland were definitely lame but if the film was projected as something that was made for kids then the Anti-Robots could have got its credits, guess this film is too childish for grown ups. Or I think so. Hugh Laurie does not give us an extraordinary acting but sticks to his usual light acting and it goes by. I, an amateur reviewer , am giving a rating of 6 because of the lack of something new in this film but this does entertain people who just wants to catch another fantasy movie. Well, at least it partially entertained me. There's that.Too futuristic... "Tomorrowland" is a movie which as the title says the movie for tomorrow and how it will be. When I watched the trailer I expected a Sci-Fi movie but not like this. The only explanation was that "Tomorrowland" is a Walt Disney movie and that's why was so futuristic and came into exaggeration. I liked this movie but I expected to like it even more. First I will start with the things that I found a bit annoying and after I will say what I liked. To begin with I believe that movie does not make a good explanation about what is going on and the viewer has to figure it out be himself. Another thing that I did not like was the visual effects that were used which I found too much and unnecessary to exist. On the other hand there were some good things in this movie which presented with a very good way. One of those was that you have to have faith, to believe at yourself and just dream. Because if we cannot dream then we are simply dead. Finally I think that "Tomorrowland" is not a bad movie but in my occasion I had more expectations from it. It's a good movie and I would recommend it to someone to watch it.contemporary entertainment Tomorrowland is one of those movies that appears to be a litmus test for the audience on IMDb. Either they'd give it the maximum number of stars and it would be seen as useful by like-minded people. Or they'd get revolted by the high rating and opt for one star to get the rating in balance. The truth is clearly somewhere in-between, as my rating demonstrates. I'm not sure whether i'm getting old or simply appreciate my spare time, but as the time goes by i can't relax and enjoy the CGI overkill of contemporary entertainment. Tomorrowland is probably not the best example, since it has a story, unlike other giants of modern cinema, such as Godzilla, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Transformers: Age of Extinction, 300 Rise of an Empire, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, just to name a few. But i might be too harsh on those movies, since it seems that the moviegoers of today want their money's worth of action. Besides, i wasn't sure whether i've been the right target audience for Torrowland. I guess this was supposed to be some kind of fairy tale. Discussing actors' performance or character development would be beyond the point. Anyhow, go see Tomorrowland to switch off from everyday activities, then forget Tomorrowland and get back to reality.An absolutely amazing film audiences need to see to believe . . Disney strikes again, in this amazing, inspiring adventure into the depths of creativity. This time, Disney takes on a bit of a more mature - like take in "Tomorrowland" giving it it's amazing sense of humor, as well as lines the entire family will laugh too. The story of this film was truly unique. It fells the tail of two unlikely characters that come together, bonding in some truly amazing character connection, and chemistry against a group of cyborgs that refuse to allow them into the hidden land, only available for those who connect the clues, and figure the secrets of Tomorrowland. It's a story that executes amazingly, sending the audience on an amazing thrill ride of entertainment, action, comedy; as well as a ride of conflicted feelings that proves to not fail. In this case, audiences all around, no matter what age will enjoy the pleasantly unique story, as well as the characters. All characters combine amazingly, creating amazing chemistry, as well as acting. The film, here, also possesses an amazing sense of style. It has many, many visual effects that will fill the audience with a sense of adventure, and inspiration. It also widens the eyes of audiences everywhere with it's complex - like story that explains itself through out the film, opening some mysteries, and twists that'll guarantee to brighten up anyone who watches this. In conclusion for this little review, "Tomorrowland" is a truly meaningful film that had depth. It also possesses true adventure, and inspiration. It's an amazing ride for anyone, no matter the age, as the film also possesses some mature humor. It also has a truly unique sense of style from visual effects, character development, plot, and story. Making this a truly nice film that I had the pleasure of seeing early. I truly recommend this to anyone. You won't be disappointed!An original movie that inspires, one of the best this year Finally an original concept movie not based on books/stories/previous materials. I went to a test screening only armed with the limited knowledge from the trailers. I think this definitely increase my enjoyment of the movie. The movie never cease to amaze me from start to finish. Admittedly there are moments which i was starting to get a little impatient. But right then something would happen and drawn me into the movie again. To be fair, I probably enjoy it more because of above average familiarity with Disney parks/history/movies. But there are plenty of humor and ideas in the movie to fascinate everyone. Also, please relax on challenging the logic in this movie, it mostly makes sense but is not bulletproof. Luckily, there is enough going on that should keep audience from doing that. There is one strong message being delivered throughout the movie But it never tries to shove it down your throat. In the end, it inspires hope and gets me thinking. I had fun watching the movie, and left with plenty of conversation topics with my son. The movie definitely planted a seed of change in me. I am just hoping that it will have similar effect on everyone. All the actors did an awesome job. I have seen similar performance from George Clooney, but never in the context presented in this movie. Without saying too much, an otherwise ridiculous relationship turns out to be one of the more believable and memorable one due to his acting. The fresh faces were natural in their roles and gave strong performances. One of them actually reminded me of Audrey Hepburn, if she was a child star. Anyway, if you can go to this movie with an open mind and don't try to over-think things, it will be a pleasant experience. Take it for what it is - an original with plenty of ideas, fun mix of action and bewilderment, some Disney Magic, and a message that hopefully can touch some people.Tomorrowland Delivers Wow Factor Along With Important Messages How can you describe this film, a film that is original (which is very rare these days), surprising (also rare) and it has a perfect ratio of pretty much everything! Tomorrowland is a movie of wow that makes you want to go out and do something knowing that nothing is impossible. This film has everything. It has a wonderful, heartwarming plot with a good 50/50 split of drama and comedy and is filled with many wonderful morals and messages. It can be called a tale, sci-fi, adventure and more. But, this film has something for everyone.  Tomorrowland starts off showing a young high school girl named Casey (Britt Robertson) who is told that the world is being polluted, destroyed and slowly ending. She asks why something is not being done about it. One day, she finds a mysterious pin which takes her to a world not in the future, past or present, not on Earth. It is somewhere beyond our knowledge, known as Tomorrowland. She embarks on adventure trying to get there and meets many people including Frank Walker (George Clooney) who is a former child genius and actually lived in this place for some time. This film is truly an enjoyable experience to watch. Director Brad Bird does an extraordinary job making this a master piece. From the perfect cast to the original story, it is breathtaking to watch. The cinematography is perfect - not too modest and not to forced either. The cast is inspiring. George, Britt and the rest of the cast make jokes, deliver dramatic moments, and everything in between. The relationship between the main characters are sad at times, happy at times. They are heartwarming and draw you in. Disney has really outdone itself so many times and they surprise us again with a very original and nicely done film which will become the next phenomena.  My favorite scene is when Casey, Frank and a girl named Athena (you must watch the film to learn more about this very special character) go to Paris and they launch something out of the Eiffel tower. It is action-packed, funny and stunning to watch. The special effects are out of this world and thrilling.  There are so many moral messages. The main one is "nothing is impossible and never stop questioning the world around you." In the film, Casey never stops asking questions and, because of this, a very surprising thing happens. I recommend this film for kids ages 8 to18 and give it 5 out of 5 stars. This film is truly one of the greatest films of the year and wonderfully executed. It opens in theaters on May 22 so don't miss it. Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

George Clooney lately has not inspired me to go to the theatres, but the director Brad Bird does excite the inner child in me. Can his exceptional run of great films continue? Cinematic rating: 2.25 stars  Reel Dialogue Rating: 2.5 stars A robot from the future comes to enlist the services of a juvenile delinquent for the purposes of saving the present and future worlds. They must stay one step ahead of futuristic law enforcement officers. Ultimately the robot and the teen must choose to save the world and determine how much they are willing to sacrifice. Add in an environmentalist message and a Disney-like setting and it sound like the a new spin for the Terminator franchise, but it is not, it is the basic premise for Tomorrowland. Which is the return to the director's chair for Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol). He is telling this familiar story line with the optimistic Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) as the lead. She is chosen by her robotic recruiter, Athena (Raffey Cassidy), because she is a brilliant dreamer. Casy's role is to become the saviour of the future. She and Athena must enlist the help of Frank Walker (George Clooney), whose history with Athena and the world of Tomorrowland has left him a bitter and reclusive man. Their journey leads them to the harsh realities of trying to find Utopia and attempting to fix the world in which they live. Can they reach Tomorrowland, bring hope to the future and the present day worlds?  In Brad Bird's future, it must be a world of monologuing. Interestingly, it was the warning for villains in The Incredibles that long-winded speeches would lead to their downfall. This hilarious realisation in the 2004 animated gem must have been lost on Bird, as the writer and director of Tomorrowland. The cinematic exercise seemed to be piecing together a film between one arduous monologue after another. After awhile, the feeling was that George Clooney and Hugh Laurie (House) were applying for a Presidential nomination. The beginning of the film offered some hope for the story. The historical epilogue of Frank Walker's life was an optimistic, creative and hope-filled adventure to Tomorrowland that offered enjoyable intrigue for the rest of the story, but unfortunately never lifts beyond this opening segment. The story is slow, boring and only allows for glimpses of the originality that we have come to expect from Brad Bird. In the end the message becomes a heavy handed environmentalist message that was connected together by an unoriginal story. The portions that were meant to be humorous were merely creepy and for a supposedly optimistic film, the message becomes empty and joyless. There were some good special effects and the use of the Eiffel Tower was a brief glimpse of creativity, but if those are the key highlights, Tomorrowland fails to deliver. The language and violence are mild and it earns the PG rating, but just because children could go see it does not mean they should.  When it comes to opening up some of the life's bigger questions, Tomorrowland offers many veins of discussion. The need of a saviour, mankind's role in the universe and what does the future hold for this world are considered, but the answers are unfulfilling and empty. Bird seems to forget that there is a spiritual element to the human condition. God is the missing character in the equation on how to fix the world. It did show that without God in the mix for the answers of this world's problems, the answers are hopeless and we are left to find the solutions ourselves; solutions that will inevitably fail. But God does not leave us without hopeful solutions for the future, but understanding the answers can only be found in God.  Leaving the cinema... Maybe the expectations for Tomorrowland were too high, but it is one of the biggest disappointments of 2015. Brad Bird has had a great track record up to this point in his career, but he failed to deliver. A heavy-handed environmentalist message disguised as a children's adventure. The message of the film could be forgivable if it was a well executed film, but it was not. Hope and optimism are essential for mankind to exist, but Tomorrowland's message is poorly executed and hopeless. We can only hope Brad Bird can get back to his original form with The Incredibles 2.  Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the future hold? (The book of Revelation, James 4:13-16) 2. Can we solve our own problems? (Proverbs 3:5, Philippians 4:6) 3. Is there anything wrong with following your dreams? (Jeremiah 29:11, Matthew 6:33) Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews #tomorrowlandGreat build up to a disappointing climax. The movie starts out slow establishing our protagonists and supporting characters. Before too long the adventure begins, following our protagonist as she discovers Tomorrowland and the amazing events on earth as was shown in the trailers. This is the best part of the movie. The effects are well done, the acting is good and there are good comedic moments that made me laugh. The best part is the mystery build up. Things aren't spoon fed to you, you are just thrown into this fantasy world and it fills you with eagerness to discover what's actually going on. Unfortunately this is where it all falls apart. The movie fails to explain much of the mysteries it raises in the build up. What is Tomorrowland, its relationship to our world, the motivation for interacting with us, how their technology works, who are the people of Tomorrowland etc. none of these questions are addressed. But what really killed it for me was the lack of any motivation for our antagonist. An under developed character to begin with he offers a 10 second nonsensical speech for a motive that can be summarized as "humans bad". A good analogy for this is the series Lost. Imagine if Lost never explained any of the mysterious events happening on the island. The reason for these specific characters to be there, the relationships between them past and future, and no motivation for the antagonists. That is Tomorrowland in a nutshell.A Visually Stunning and Heartfelt Sci-fi Adventure Tomorrowland is truly Brad Bird's baby, full of intense action, emotional heft and imaginative creativity that only Disney could create. Not the company, but Walt Disney himself, as Tomorrowland is Disney's invention. The film, though, takes the "ride" to unbelievable heights, and I'm curious as to why there's so much hate surrounding the film. Frank Walker (Clooney), a boy genius, must help a persistent and trouble-making teenager (Robertson) save the world by going to a place called Tomorrowland, where the greatest inventors and creators came together to envision a better world. Brad Bird's direction and writing (with Damon Lindelof) is superb, using some traditional Disney fun, but also by implementing his style in full-form; stylish action, smooth fast-paced sequences and genuine heart, which is shown not through Britt Robinson's Casey Newton, but through Clooney's Walker, but I won't spoil his story; it helps to forward the film. The visuals are absolutely breath-taking, Michael Giacchino's score is one of his best as it compliments each scene with sincerity, and the acting is great from all ends. But, the biggest complaint I've seen so far is the way the film depicts its story. I can understand some criticisms, but to say the film is crap or one of the biggest disappointments ever is just sad. Like the idea of the place, the film doesn't focus on resolution. No, it focuses on tomorrow, what comes after. So, if you think the second act of the film drags quite a bit, it's because you're watching it as a traditional movie with traditional story-telling. This isn't that at all. I feel the marketing for the film didn't help what the movie was going for, but because of Bird's direction, the heart of the story and strong performances, this film is extremely memorable, even if it isn't ground-breaking. I just hope it's at least successful, since the reviews aren't helping its arrival to theaters, because it really is one to see on the big screen. And looking at how my review is being negatively received, I just pity anyone and everyone who calls themselves a film buff or movie-goer, because Tomorrowland was and is one of the most original films ever made. I'd like to see anyone who downvoted my review to make a bold, original film with important themes and messages.Easily Forgettable This is a typical Disney movie, in a positive sense, that show and teach kids (and also adults) about imagination, courageous, persistence, the power of dream, family value, etc. Same ingredients, different scripts. Tomorrowland will bring you to the future world with all the perfection and state of the art technology, anything that kids could've thought of, with nice animation and portrayal of future city, transportation, people, with also the touch of fun inside. The era where human can time travel, master the quantum mechanic and use it to ease the life. All is great, all is beautiful, all is encouraging... But the story is just so typical and predictable, i kind of regret to see the movie just before the first half ended, and hope it will end soon, I think I'm not the only once since I watch few people left the theater before the movie ended :(. This movie is like The Matrix meets Back To The Future, so last year and easily forgettable. Not a really pleasant way to spend my two hours..It's as if director Brad Bird gathered together all the ideas that Philip K. Dick and Jules Verne thought were unfilmable ‚Äì and used them as a basis for his screenplay. "This part may get a little weird," remarks George Clooney's Frank Walker as his trio of intrepid travelers prepares for satellite teleportation. Ironically, nearly the entirety of "Tomorrowland" is just a little too bizarre, thanks to its curious juxtaposition of clashing genres, tones, and concepts. Magic pins and precocious children intermingle with robotic menaces and subatomic particle technology in a hodgepodge of dubious ideas and worlds that offers endless questions yet vexingly dawdles when providing answers. Many of the science-fiction notions buried within "Tomorrowland's" overly polished exterior are fascinating and worthy of exposition. But most fail to develop appropriately in the excessively colorful setting of rebellious youths and lighthearted combat against goofily grinning android assassins. If only the misadventures had been approached with more sincerity and gravity (or, alternatively, a larger abundance of cartoonish shenanigans), the future could have been at least somewhat thrilling. Traveling to the New York World's Fair in 1964, young Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson) intends to submit his creation ‚Äì a nearly functioning jetpack ‚Äì into an inventor's competition. Though turned away by stern judge Nix (Hugh Laurie), Frank refuses to give up on his work, inspiring the enigmatic girl Athena (Raffey Cassidy) to invite him to a secret world of futuristic wonder. But after decades of innovation, a mature Frank (George Clooney) finds disillusionment and disappointment replacing his once indomitable ingenuity. When a force from his past introduces him to the unwaveringly optimistic Casey Newton (Britt Robertson), Frank embarks on the adventure of a lifetime to save two worlds from a seemingly inevitable destruction. The film begins with Walker's insistence that "the future can be scary." But the rest of it doesn't support that statement at all. In fact, "Tomorrowland" is much more of a kids' movie than viewers might expect ‚Äì complete with Disney morals and messages (such as the power of hope) and far too much childish enthusiasm. An excessive amount of soppy sentimentality oozes from nearly every interaction and speech. The first several minutes resemble a juvenile television special from the '60s, riddled with exaggerated expressions, overly enunciated conversations, and a phony sense of wonderment from a small boy's perspective. It even uses highly recognizable Disneyland rides, as if the production is an advertisement for a product instead of a movie. And indeed, viewing "Tomorrowland" feels a bit like watching strangers climb aboard a series of Disneyland attractions, one right after the other, having quite a bit of fun without sharing that enjoyment with the audience. This ties into the utter lack of cohesion in the storyline. Uninspired narrative mess aside, the plot continues to scurry down the proverbial rabbit hole with greater and greater sci-fi strangeness ‚Äì without an end in sight. It takes nearly 105 minutes before any explanations are given, which is so far in that no one will care about the characters or their plights after such a lengthy period of random confrontations and ventures. Walker even exclaims somewhere near that point: "Do I have to explain everything? Can't you just be amazed and move on?" But being indiscriminately assaulted with nonsensical visuals, time travel theories, tachyonic fusion, interdimensionary traversing, self-fulfilling prophecies, and extremely advanced artificial intelligence (with empathy interfaces!) demands just a bit of detail reconciliation from time to time. It's as if director Brad Bird gathered together all the ideas that Philip K. Dick, H.G. Wells, and Jules Verne thought were unfilmable ‚Äì and then used them as a basis for his screenplay.Great visuals, love the premise, and the acting. Really don't understand why some took this film apart, but obviously the grand visuals and exciting camera angles were wasted. The story was simple, one that shows how a young woman's hope, creativity, &amp; imagination can be part of any solution. People get too stuck on the literal and forget it is a movie. It isn't supposed to cure cancer or create world peace, just entertain and maybe get people to think about the future. When one remembers that going into a movie, than sit back and appreciate the efforts of crew. Acting was very well done by all; artwork, graphics, scenes, and lighting were spot on; music kept things moving along; the story flowed from start to finish, had humor, serious, sadness, heart, love, shame, pride, intelligence, and clearly ended on a good note. It is a Disney film, they aren't in the market to make downer movies, but show humanity struggle and succeed.Ambitious and Visually Epic Sci-Fi, Dragged Down by Narrative Shortcomings "What if there's a place where nothing is impossible?" This question, asked by George Clooney's sardonic and grumpy inventor character, Frank Walker, carries a tempting tone that makes itself an interrogative form of a matter-of-factly revelation, inviting its audience to entertain the possibility. The place is called 'Tomorrowland', a bustling futuristic metropolis where world's brightest minds are gathered together to save the world from impending destruction. It's a place with 'Perfection' written all over it: trains zoom across the sky through air rails snaking between and around looming skyscrapers, while other airborne automobiles fly here and there like the entire space between sky and earth is nothing but a single boulevard, layers of waterpools hang adrift in the air, and swimmers swoop down from one to another, while flare rockets surge toward the sky in whistling upward projections.The idea thrown holds power, sounding able to erect a foundation of curiosity that is capable of sustaining hold over its spectators. But the idea is just an idea the film is ever struggling to realize. As the story moves forward, the narrative itself keeps breaking its potential, losing the chance of realizing its optimistic output, in the wake of its ever-conflicting elements. There's Frank, who has long been drowned in his own pessimism, embittered by his personal tragedies and hopelessness, and there's Casey (Britt Robertson), a jubilant modern day-genius, who can't let go of her hopes of a better world. The film lectures that the impending destruction is inevitable, and yet it clings tightly on the possibility that it's still fixable. The latter notion has an enduring appeal, but it gets crushed each time by the more imminent horror of unavoidable extinction. Turns out, 'Tomorrowland' is a phantasmagorical utopia that may be only existing in few people's hopes, like Casey's, ever threatened of dissipation in the presence of a brutal fate that people had long made for themselves. It's a long trip to a dead end, but it keeps fixing itself for no fathomable reason. On times when it flies, the narrative takes Casey's optimism as its wings, ever attempting to reconstruct its promises while its messed-up conflicts keep pushing everything asunder. It's an unsettling experience that leaves the audience in a perplexing decision-making, whether to care or not at all, about where everything is headed. Tomorrowland makes itself sound an anomaly when it throws questions that even itself can't provide an answer, let alone a sure one. It feeds on many 'What Ifs', but struggles to deliver something that could satisfy the curiosity. Tomorrowland fails largely on promises it presented during its build up, and it gets itself dragged toward a bland and unaffecting climax. It would be unforgivable though to dismiss the movie's biggest surprise: Athena, the female version of Peter Pan, who gives both Frank and Casey, the magical Tomorrowland pin. Played by newcomer, Raffey Cassidy, the forever 12-year old Athena, possesses an otherworldly charm which Frank himself couldn't resist. She's precociously a real charmer, and she stands out despite of her incoherently structured storyline. This doesn't make a substantial force to lift the overall narrative failure from its convoluted mess, but it's a one beautiful portion to stick your attention at when everything else loses its appeal. In the end, we're all like Casey, still dreaming to reach the stars while her parents keep hinting her the possibility that there might be nothing there waiting. The Tomorrowland she stumbles into, is nothing but a hanging possibility that is ever positioned at the verge of collapse. This is the world that the movie is trying to make us realize, and maybe, just maybe, it only mines the horror of possible extinction to actually make us propel into action, and do something to stop the destruction. Casey believes in mankind and that there's still hope for something like Tomorrowland to actually exist, Frank is convinced that the Earth's horrendous fate is sealed. I'd like to put my faith on the former. 6/10You'll feel cheated, much like you would if you thought optimism will solve the world's problems. Global warming! Political unrest! Corruption! Despair! Sadness!  These are the ailments of the story of Tomorrowland, and the proposed solutions to them are as heavy-handed as they appear above.  The story is about a teenage girl, Casey (Britt Robertson), who holds herself to be fearless, ambitious, and incredibly bright. She is one of the few optimists left in a world (much like ours today) that is wallowing in despair over dystopian nightmares being realized and where the melting of the ice caps is both figurative and literal. And what's worse, she's the only one to think that there is a solution to all the world's ailments. She is "recruited" by a young girl from Tomorrowland, who shows her a glimpse of an alternate dimension where the best and brightest of the world gather and build a utopian society, or so they think. The problem is that they stopped recruiting when they saw that the world will end using technology they created that could predict the future, or at least see one version of it. In other words, they've given up hope in fixing our world. Frank (George Clooney) was one of their citizens that spoke out against this policy and was banished. He is put together with Casey and they travel to Tomorrowland to stop the world from ending in a matter of months, told by Frank's homemade doomsday clock.  Tomorrowland is a movie that runs on nostalgia and underlying it is a bankrupt moral philosophy on solving the world's problems. Imagine the philosophy underlying TED talks (technology, engineering, and design will solve the world's problems) making a movie for children to watch and be inspired to adopt their meta solution to the world's ailments. The solution is that we don't have enough "dreamers" working together building innovative and well-designed inventions. People don't believe they're special enough, and they give in to their sadness and don't believe in themselves.  What's painfully missing from Tomorrowland is any conscience. Even tonight before I saw the movie I had a conversation with a friend over "Jurassic World" coming out this summer and my fears on what they might do to the story. In the worst case, they make the movie about dinosaurs. In the best case, they carry the theme of the relationship of science and morality that upheld the first movie so well and showed the terror that innovation without a conscience (that word even means "with science" though I know it wasn't coined with that in mind per se) brings.  The only vices in our world, according to Tomorrowland, is being uninventive and a pessimist. Ironically, the movie revels in clich√© after clich√©, hoping we'll be wowed by the mediocre spectacles that are references to older future-chic tropes.  The theme that runs throughout the movie and eventually shows its own superficiality and impotence is the value of raw optimism. I'll contrast this to the virtue of grit which is the far more superior trait to hold. Optimism is simply being positive where grit is more akin to courage. One is a formation of outlook, the other is drive. Certainly Casey is optimistic, but where the movie gets it wrong is saying that's all we need.  Also there's the assumption that raw talent is what we have as the resource to tap for solving the world's problem. And with this view it shows that there are the gifted dreamers, then there's everyone else. Where the movie is misleading is in how it tells young viewers that believing in yourself and being special is all you need to solve these age-old problems the world is fraught with. Our time is terrible and we need optimists. What Casey never does in the movie, and what any inventor or great thinker will tell you about genius is that it takes a lot of work. They fail. They fail a lot, and they get up and they edit their work. They learn from their mistakes and they build a better invention next time. They learn when to scrap a project, and when to stick with it. Learning that virtue will serve our young people better than mere optimism. Certainly optimism is a part of it, though it's only one facet to a complex set of character traits.  The problem is that Casey never fails in the movie. If anything she waltzes into every situation and seems to know more than everyone else, and she never has to work at anything. You never seen any of her inventions (though she does have a cool security camera disrupting drone she uses), you never see her take a crack at something and it not work. She just bulldozes into situations with overconfidence that smacks of arrogance and somehow the inept adults in the story never thought of incredibly obvious solutions to problems in the story.  In the end, Tomorrowland falls too short to be called anything worth watching. The story has too many uninteresting characters with a plot that doesn't pick up and when it finally does you ask yourself, "Is that it?" You'll feel cheated, much like you would if you thought optimism will solve the world's problems.Do you still believe¬Ö.?..........

Or we are just walking towards our inevitable destruction? I wandered into tomorrowland when I was feeling very down and tired, but I am so glad I have "touched the badge". I think Mr Brad Bird still has the heart of a child, and it takes the heart and eyes of a child to understand the message of the movie.

In the first hour, all of those were there, but it all fell flat in the second half. Wonder and excitement were exchanged for political/environmental intrigue and concern, That was certainly something we've seen a lot before. I came to see something new, ingenious, and inspiring. What I saw were some really nifty gadgets and ideas leading up to a possibly huge one, then all I got was environmental warnings and action with a few explosions. But I digress on that until later. The acting was fairly good! George Clooney did quite well, as expected, Hugh Laurie was fantastic though not very memorable. Raffey Cassidy did decently, I enjoyed her calm and collected role. Britt Robertson started out promising, but her character devolved as the film sped on. Keegan-Michael Key's appearance was unexpected, but comical indeed. I laughed as I heard the Wookiee call in the background of his action scene (it's worth listening for). Speaking of humor, Bird gave it a good successful attempt in the first half. However, for me, the funniest moment may not have been intentional, but I believe it was. After Frank (Clooney) and Casey (Robertson) meet up with Athena (Cassidy), all three are in the vehicle. Athena, looking as if she is 12, is the one driving, with the teenage Casey in the middle and the middle-aged Frank in the passenger seat. The scene shows this for at least 10 seconds without dialogue, and I couldn't help but laugh. From this point on, though, humor didn't break through as in the first half. --SPOILER ALERT-- From here until the concluding statement, I'll be discussing plot details that would likely ruin the film's surprises for you. You have been warned. The Eiffel Tower plays an unexpected role in the film, one that I'm glad I didn't notice occur in the trailer. When the three travelers need to return to Tomorrowland, most gates have been shut. One option is left open to them, however, and that is where the Tower comes in. A memorial exhibit to inventors rests atop the Tower, and it leads to a hidden secret: a rocket buried underneath. The Tower splits apart into a launch pad, and they blast off in the rocket. This whole sequence seemed very National Treasure-ish, and almost unnecessary. The only reason I support it, sans the over-the-top theatrics, is that it does something very important to the topic of the film. It honors past inventors. The rest of the film is all about the future, unnamed newcomers, what could be. But they took at least a little bit of time honoring those who got us to where we are. And that, I applaud, even if it were only a few minutes of the total screen time. The ending plot, however, was half-baked. It could have used more pre-production scrutiny, and some post- as well. For example, Casey's relationship with her father was hardly there, mostly implied. She looked to him as great inspiration, but we saw hardly any of that. And where was her mother? Her father wore a wedding ring, but I don't remember any explanation. Also, near the end of the film, wind blows her father's cap off her head, and it never appears again, despite its importance to her. This might be because she later brought her father to Tomorrowland, and had him in the flesh, rather than an extension of him, but still. Make that hat scene useful. Governor Nicks' demise was also not thought through as well. When Athena self-destructs, everyone was fully aware it was going to happen, and where it was going to happen. The Monitor above them all is rocked with an explosion, and begins to plummet. Suddenly, everyone must scramble to get away, even though they knew this was coming. Even if the whole Monitor wasn't going to fall, debris from the explosion would. The reason they didn't have Casey get out of the way like any sensible person who knew this would be crashing down on them in a few minutes if they didn't, is this: Nicks was trapped down there, and having Casey leave the premises prematurely would make his death look far too cold-hearted. They would be leaving him there knowing he would die, and not help him. But if she's running for her life, with seconds to spare, that suddenly makes it okay to leave the villain behind. They could have come up with a far better demise, one that made more sense at least. And how did she have enough time to get clear anyway? The whole platform was crushed by that thing, and she didn't start running until it had fallen for 5 seconds. But I digress once more. --END SPOILER ALERT-- Given Brad Bird's directorial career, this isn't a highlight of his. It was quite imaginative, but needed a lot more development in the second half. It devolved from an inspiring showcase of creative ideas and futuristic inventions to environmental concern and flying punches. We've seen the latter two a lot already, I wish their focus was fully set on tomorrow, and not themes we've seen explored a thousand times already. When it comes to parental guidance on this film, there are some minimally violent scenes, sans blood and disturbing sights. A few instances of language appear, though. Nothing sexually inappropriate occurs or is hinted at. *I was given early access to see the film by Walt Disney Studios. I was not required to write a positive review, and the opinions here are my own.*Had the potential of becoming an original movie, nothing major here just a Disney extravaganza!! First of all, I had greater hopes by entering this movie that George Clooney was going to kill it in the Sci-Fi movie genre, unfortunately I was disappointed. He didn't seem to fit the role, I don't know why, honestly he seemed to be a little sloppy and unfit physically, plus his performance I can see that he tried his best, but his character did not just fill that major role in the movie. Maybe a more younger actor, would have fitted the role better and speaking of actors, the other two major roles in this movie depicted by Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy were top notch acting that I believe without them the movie would have failed drastically. Britt Robertson helped by her stunning good looks and performance, will be a major actor of Hollywood in the upcoming years, maybe the next Julia Roberts or Meryl Streep. The other young girl in this movie Raffey Cassidy, I have no words to describe her, she is very likable and just overloaded with cuteness, that at times I think my eyes teared up a little bit.  Aside from the film's good looks and terrific graphics, it was heart capturing in the beginning, but then that all went to waist after the movie laked a compelling story and ending. In the mind of a nine year old, this movie will probably be embedded deep in his/her memory, no questions about that, but to anyone above their 20's or little bit younger, save your hardship of going through and watching this movie and go see a real life movie. It felt like torture to watch this movie expecting to be a major Sci-Fi flick of the year, and to end up experiencing a movie that feels like something of a Disney movie unfortunately. The movie was very forgettable even before the closing scene, it felt empty and lacking that drive that good directors put in a good movie. I had to mention the horrible wardrobe on George Clooney and Hugh Laurie's characters, I wanted to stab my eyes so badly, very poor choices, maybe a 10 year old would have had better ideas.  Last but not least, it is very heartbreaking to see all the effort put in this movie like the amazing visual design and graphics and all the people behind the camera go to waste.Tomorrowland is a great movie for the kids but not without it's fair share of platitudes and clich√©s Tomorrowland is visually very appealing. You can sense that a lot of attention has been given to details like the uniforms, people and technology of the future. It is pretty believable and makes you want to be a part of the story. Credits to the composer for the accompanying soundtrack. Even though you get the feeling that you have heard it in other movies before it goes well with the cinematography and the story line.  The biggest strength of Tomorrowland is its unique and compelling plot. It's a very fresh idea and you're constantly engaged to know what will happen next. It is packed with a surprising amount of action sequences and something that you'd probably not expect from a PG movie targeted primarily at kids. Where the movie excels is instilling this idea in the audience that they are more than a mere participant in the future. No matter what problems engulf us (natural disasters, surveillance state, epidemics) they have the ability to fix it and create something better.  Unfortunately, the movie doesn't have the universal appeal of movies like Toy Story or Wall-e which can be enjoyed regardless of your age. Tomorrowland is not without a lot of clich√©s and platitudes where it's not so subtle about the positive messages it's trying to impart to the audience. Instead, it keeps badgering us over and over on why it's important for us to be good. The main character does a decent job but can be annoying at times when the film is trying to portray how brilliant and special she is. You never really understand what her special ability is besides being optimistic and knowing "how things work". It's not convincing when she can easily solve problems that her scientist dad who works for NASA is grappling with.  Overall, it's a good movie to watch with your family, but don't expect it to have the lasting impression that some of the other Disney/Pixar movies have.7/10 A fun sci-fi adventure that unfortunately doesn't gives itself enough space to explore what it hints at and makes more confusion in its message than it should. It is a truly fantastic ride, but unfortunately it isn't the mind piece it promises to be. Before getting into positives and negatives I just want to talk about a scene in the film, but just give me a second to introduce it. I am a big, big, big fan, actually I will go as far to say I am a maniac about long takes. I am really obsessed with them more than anybody (except probably Alejandro Inarritu and Emmanuel Lubezki), I am a person who is into cinematography a lot and thinks of the visual aspect of a movie before anything else and there is just something about long takes that fascinates me, I think they are able to give an experience that no other shot will deliver many times and sometimes go as far as thinking that everything should be shot in a long take because it would make it more effective. That long premise is just to modestly give a little more weight to what I am about to say: "Tomorowland" has probably one of the best long takes I have ever seen in my life. It might just be better than classic long takes as in "Touch of Evil" or "Goodfellas" and no I am not exaggerating it is that good. It uses the idea that is behind the long take to it's advantage and makes the scene jaw dropping, riveting and fantastical because of that. The best part is that I didn't realize it was a long take up until the end and that generally doesn't pass under the radar for me. I'm telling you no matter what you think of the movie, you will be mesmerized for those 3-4 minutes and I don't want to add anymore so not to spoil the beauty you will witness. It added a couple of points to the film to me because other than being splendid it fit perfectly. Fortunately that is not everything that is going on in "Tomorrowland". There are brilliant visual ideas all around, the imagination that is pored into the film is astounding and absolutely pleasant. Its originality is very genuine and brings to life a world that I was totally fascinated by and loved spending time in, yet unfortunately didn't spend enough. The movie doesn't focus really that much on Tomorrowland itself and with what it promises that really is a major let down. Fortunately you spend time with characters that are interesting and played with heart, with maybe Roberston's character being a little one dimensional yet compensated by a very good performance. Now probably the biggest plus the movie has, aside that long take, is Raffey Cassidy. She is Tyler-Sheridan-in-"Mud"/Haley-Joel-Osment-in-"Sixth Sense" level brilliant. Truly. What a performance. I was in awe, every time she was on screen I thought to myself: "Is that really a child actor??". Giacchino also delivers another one of his great scores. More on the negative side is the fact that the film too often ponders into generic storytelling and it has a very, very unclear message other than also making less and less sense the more I thought about it. The third act completely ruins the film and wastes what could have been a really, really wonderful climax. Moreover the green screen is intolerably noticeable in some scenes and others have too much CGI involved. The experience was great, I was always on board ready for the next event to unfold and had really some load of fun despite there being a bunch of holes, which *rant* I confidently attribute to Lindelof given his embarrassing resume in storytelling, as always he proves he is incapable of writing anything that comes to close the circle he started, but since Brad Bird has a writing credit too I won't indulge in this rant anymore *end rant*.Think positive. Drink Coke. I'll admit it. I watch a lot of movies and I sometimes fall asleep during movies. Usually during the "O No, we're never going to succeed" part - followed by the crunch time predictable action scenes. This was one of those movies. Briefly. But, seriously, this is just another 'drown the cat' movie (pun on the standard 'save the cat' movie writing software used by Hollywood - no animal harm intended). It had all the right action scenes in all the right places with the standard Disney message free of charge: Smile. Be positive. Dare to dream. The main character is Emotion, her robot girlfriend is Reason and Emotion is there to save all the men in her life from her father to her little brother to the disgruntled man 'down the street'. The theme is clearly 'never lose hope'. Thing is: It's full of not so subliminal messages on how to behave in a model Disney citizen way. Like the scene in which the heroine has low blood sugar and pulls out two coca cola's from grumpy man's fridge and drinks them both. Whew, that was hard work. Love, peace and happiness. Drink a Coke. Or two. And then there's the scene where the little robots of the future are all dressed up nicely in Mexx world citizen clothing and set out - boys first of course - to save our future world. No, please, not mine. You will be assimilated. I made the mistake with this movie that Disney was trying to be intelligent. They weren't. At least, I hope they weren't.Like a seemingly thrilling theme park ride that never delivers a satisfying payoff, 'Tomorrowland' offers thrill in the journey but not in the discovery of what it really is Very little has been said by its creators about 'Tomorrowland', so you can't quite blame us for feeling skeptical about this amusement- park adaptation. After all, pretty much all we know is that it has something to do with a teenage girl named Casey (Britt Robertson) who comes into possession of a magic pin capable of transporting her into the titular metropolis, almost just as soon finds herself being chased by a couple of 'men in black', and is saved (reluctantly) by a grumpy scientist played by George Clooney who has a rocket attached to his second- floor bathroom tub. But as we've come to realise, there is a good reason for all that secrecy; indeed, if there's one thing we will say now that we have been there and back, it is that the thrill is in the journey of discovering. Framing the narrative that follows is Clooney's curmudgeon inventor Frank Walker, who tussles with an off-camera female voice at the start over how to explain the context for our benefit. When he finally gets started, we find ourselves being acquainted with Frank when he was a young boy (Thomas Robinson), who brings his first big invention to the 1964 New York World's Fair. A retrofitted Electrolux vacuum cleaner that he intends as a jet pack, the contraception is scoffed at by a dismissive Hugh Laurie, but greeted with admiration by an enigmatic wise-beyond-her-years young girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy). Athena invites Frank to follow her without telling him where she is headed, but after a brief ride through a wink-wink attraction called 'It's A Small World', Frank ends up making his first trip to the gleaming city of the future, or to be more accurate, a city situated on a whole different plane. Fast-forward many years later, and we are in Cape Canaveral, Fla, where we meet Casey for the first time. The daughter of a NASA engineer (Tim McGraw), Casey sabotages the imminent demolition of a NASA rocket launch site in hopes of keeping the space programme going. Her latest attempt gets her caught, and it is upon being bailed out that she first finds the small pin with a 'T' emblazoned on it. Her initial shock and disbelief aside, Casey is fascinated by the shiny skyscrapers at the end of the golden wheat fields and heads right towards them to find swooping highways, crystal spires, airborne automobiles, and spectacular multi-level cylinder-like swimming pools that allow you to plunge one into another. It's spectacular all right, and we are invited to share Casey's awe in a single extended tracking shot that follows her monorail ride through the futuristic city. Alas, the future which Casey glimpsed is already in the past, and as she soon learns from she-who-gifted-the-pin Athena, the Tomorrowland of today is a hollowed-out mausoleum of glass towers. This is also where we stop, and leave the rest for you to find out layer by layer. Why was Frank and Athena booted out of Tomorrowland? What is that invention Athena talks about which should never have been invented? How is this tied to Casey, or for that matter, the fate of the present world as she knows it? TV's Lost creator Damon Lindelof is one of the two screenwriters here, so be warned that his story does keep its cards very close to its chest, revealing just enough at each turn to sustain your intrigue. And yes, there's no denying that Lindelof, who co- wrote the script with director Brad Bird, has woven an engrossing mystery about the intertwining fates of three distinct characters that are surprisingly well-defined next to one another. Like we said earlier, the thrill is in the journey of discovering; and sure enough, what we eventually find is somehow not quite as exciting or groundbreaking as one may come to anticipate. To reveal the destination would inevitably spoil the trip itself, but suffice to say that Bird tries to make a statement about the future that pop culture seems all too happy to sell us these days and ends with a call to action. Yes, many commentators have already pointed out the film's message on how inaction and nonchalance leads to a self- fulfilling prophecy of doom and destruction, and notwithstanding Bird's noble intentions at using a big-budget studio movie to put across an earnest plea for imagination, hope and collective will, let us warn those who don't like to be lectured that it does get extremely preachy right before it ends. That however proves to be the lesser of its faults. Saddled with the need to deliver blockbuster action, Bird relegates the second half of his movie to a glorified chase movie. From Frank's house of booby traps to the Eiffel Tower and all the way to Tomorrowland before the big finish, we get the equivalent of a souped-up kiddie flick, so much so that when the Paris landmark transforms into an interstellar rocket ship launcher, we are left unimpressed. Conversely, too little time is spent in and around where we actually are spellbound, such that the Tomorrowland we see seems like the build-up for a ride that never took off, which is unfortunately how we end up feeling about the entire film once the answers we are looking for are in essence told to us through clunky exposition delivered in part by Clooney and in part by Laurie. For a film supposed to move its audience to think bold and stay positive, 'Tomorrowland' comes off feeling just 'meh'. There is excitement in finding out what it is all about, but once we do and that veil of secrecy is lifted, we are left thinking 'so, that's it?' And yet for all its promise, it neither leaves you much inspired nor even enthused; instead, it leaves you wanting, wanting for more adventure, more heart, more wow, and most of all, more of Tomorrowland."Tomorrowland" is simply one of the best movies of 2015. In 2003, Walt Disney Pictures released a movie with the same name as one of its theme park rides. "A movie based on a RIDE?" said many, including yours truly. It sounded really lame. Turns out, a "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie wasn't such a bad idea after all. Four films later (and counting) ‚Äì not to mention the $3.7 billion in worldwide box office receipts ‚Äì and basing a film on a Disneyland attraction was clearly a VERY good idea, so¬Ö why not return to that well of inspiration that is the Disney theme parks? Why not, indeed. The result is "Tomorrowland" (PG, 2:10). The name comes from the section of Disney parks which shows visitors a utopian vision of the future based on imagination and innovation. At first, Tomorrowland came across as being more about big business showing off and seemed doomed to becoming no more than a quaint relic as the future became the past, but it transformed into a more vibrant and pure representation of the optimism that Disney represents. At this point you might be asking yourself, "Why is this review still talking about the Disney theme park attraction?" It isn't. But, like the "Pirates" movies, rather than "based on" a section of the Disney theme parks, "Tomorrowland" is better described as "inspired by" the attraction of the same name. And what an inspiration it is! The film's theatrical trailers may look interesting, but they don't really tell you what the movie is about, whereas I will (without spoilers, of course). Tomorrowland is a place where there's no bureaucracy or politics and the smartest and most creative people are able to realize their visions for a better world. It's a world of architectural beauty, stunning technological achievements (I have GOT to get one of those swimming pool¬Ö sets!) and where people of different backgrounds actually get along. Within the movie, Tomorrowland does exist, but in another dimension, and only a few special people can see it and actually go there. For the place to function, grow and realize its true potential, Tomorrowland requires people who are both dreamers and doers. Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is such a person. Inspired by her NASA engineer father (Tim McGraw) and encouraged by her little brother (Pierce Gagnon), Casey is a young woman who has an impressive intellect, a boundless curiosity and a heart which absolutely refuses to believe that she can't make the world a better place. The same was true of Frank Walker (George Clooney) who, as a boy (Thomas Robinson) at the 1964 World's Fair, showed himself to be quite the budding inventor and with as much optimism and wonder as present-day Casey. Although separated by a generation, both Frank and Casey are clearly people with dreams, ideas and abilities that are larger than the world in which they live. It's a good thing that there is a Tomorrowland ‚Äì and that there's a mysterious, but unflappable little girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) and a very smart man played by Hugh Laurie (now able to use his natural British accent that he had to keep hidden while playing TV's "Dr. House") to help them get there. But it's not just as simple as unleashing your full potential on a strange new world. Tomorrowland isn't quite, say, open for business just yet. And before it's ready to become Today-land for everybody on earth, the people who care most about bringing their visionary future to fruition are going to have to get past some who, for their own reasons, don't want the project to move forward. That's where the "action" in this "action/adventure" comes in. Now, if you're concerned that I may have spoiled the movie, I didn't. And if you're bothered that I didn't explain much more than the trailers, I couldn't. This isn't just about avoiding spoilers (which IS tougher than usual with this review). It's more about allowing people to experience the joy and wonder of this film for themselves. To be touched ‚Äì and inspired. "Tomorrowland" is a very special movie ‚Äì because it's more than a movie. It's a chance to dream about a better future for our planet and for the humans which call it home. This film is an oasis for optimists, but it avoids getting all Pollyanna on us. The earth's problems are shown as overwhelming, if not insurmountable (although the movie never clubs us over the head with them), but it doesn't give us easy answers or a simple recipe for success in solving these problems. Rather, it shows how the answers are already among us. With impressive and imaginative visuals, appealing characters who are effectively portrayed and a realistic yet optimistic look at problems and the beginning of solutions, this is one of the most enjoyable and encouraging movies of the year. "A+"Welcome To Tomorrowland Tomorowland (or as it was originally titled 1952) has been much talked about for awhile now. Despite a drip and drab social media campaign that dropped hints about the film, little had been revealed about it until close to its release date which added an air of mystery to it. Opening this weekend with a cast including George Clooney and Hugh Laurie, the latest film from director Brad Bird (who also directed The Incredibles) looks to be an intriguing piece of work. Is it though? It's certainly got it's share of good performances. Though Clooney has top billing, the real star of the film is Britt Roberston as the young and optimistic Casey. Living in times that stand in stark contrast to her world view, she becomes the soul of the film with everything literally revolving around her. Robertson wonderfully portrays both a sense of awe and also believability as she is trust into a world can be as threatening as it is awe inspiring. Contrasting with her is Clooney as Frank Walker. The film opens with Walker as a boy genius at the 1964 World's Fair (played by the delightful Thomas Robinson) and it is through him that we're introduced to the titular Tomorrowland. From there we, and Casey, find him as a reclusive and cynical adult who she forces to confront his past and possibly our future. Clooney, who has always seemed to be a bit out of time anyways, is perfect casting for the role and his world weariness makes for a wonderful contrast to Robertson's Casey. Watching the interactions between the two of them is one of the film's many highlights. That's not to undersell the rest of the cast. There's Laurie in a role that's hard to easily define but which he fits perfectly despite his limited amount of screen time which largely comes in the film's last act. Looking like a throwback to live action Disney protagonists of the 1950s and 60s is Raffey Cassidy as Athena though the role she plays is quite different to any of those characters. The cast also includes Tim McGraw and Pierce Gagnon as Casey's family, Kathryn Hahn and Keegan-Michael Key as a pair of interesting characters plus sci-fi fans might spot Stargate franchise actors Paul McGillion, David Nykl and Garry Chalk in small roles. Together they form a nice ensemble that populates the film and surrounds its lead actors. The highlights of the film might be in its production values. The production design and costumes range from a wonderful recreation of the 1964 World's Fair and a couple of Disney related attractions there to the near future and Tomorrowland itself. The results are a wonderful mixing of past with present, retro views of the future with a world quite similar to the one we live in now. In terms of design, Tomorrowland itself is a feast for fans of the genre with its wonderful use of everything from jet packs to 1950s rockets. Adding to that atmosphere is the score from composer Michael Giacchino which musically encapsulates what the film does visually while also properly underscoring events unfolding on screen. The results are a feast for the viewer's eyes and ears. The film is also something that seems increasingly rare: a film you can take the entire family to. While it features plenty of action sequences, there's no real gun-play or gore. The film also proves that one can do an effective science fiction/action film without resorting to dropping foul language in every other piece of dialogue. The results are oddly refreshing to say the least, especially as the film counteracts its sometimes dark themes with just the right amount of well timed humor. All of which is important because of what the underlying message of the film is. More than anything, Tomorrowland is a film about optimism and hope. It's safe to say we live in cynical (if not outright depressing) times where it seems that everything around us is out to kill us and that the world is going to hell. Tomorrowland calls back with nostalgia to a time when they wasn't the case and, using Clooney's Frank Walker character, shows us how we made the journey from optimistic futurism to the dystopia-fearing world we live in. Yet, through Robertson's Casey, shows that maybe we can recover that hope and start moving again. It's a message that seems to be working its way into popular media in recent times, including both the galaxy spanning Interstellar and the time altering antics of X-Men: Days Of Future Past from last year, yet I feel this film expresses that message better than either of those films. It may waller in that sentiment but it's better for doing so. None of which is to say that it's perfect though. The film's pacing seems a bit off somehow with the script by Bird and Damon Lindelof as it does seem to rush from one bit of spectacle to another. The film raises a lot of questions but only provides suitable answers for some of them, leading to characters and subplots that are underdeveloped (such as Laurie's character for example). Weirdly though, especially given the message at the film's heart, that seems almost forgivable. Bird, his cast and crew are taking us on a ride and we are invited to settle in for it with the underlying message being more important that the plot itself. In the final analysis, while the film perhaps has its faults, the positives far outweigh them. From its performances, strong visuals and stirring score, it calls back to the future that might have been while also addressing the world that we live in now. It's a tale of optimism and hope with a message we ought to be embracing. One can only hope that we do.Amazing movie. I didn't think I would like the movie based on its trailer, but surprisingly I did, and I liked it a lot!! It had some interesting ideas,concepts and it was full of hope which we all need.. The movie was also very funny and yet had some sad parts too. All of the actors did a good job, the visual effects were nice as well. I liked they chose a female actress and they made her smart, something you don't see a lot on TV nowadays! I think some parts of the movie were not explained very well or kind of unbelievable, but the main message of the movie was important. Overall, the movie was enjoyable and entertaining. I don't understand why would some people rate it badly, but to each his own..There is hope for the Future Highly recommended! best film of 2015 This movie is outstanding! It is the best film of 2015. IT is very original and creative! While not ignoring the problems that can destroy the world, it still provides a ray of hope for the future. And it is also very entertaining, enjoyable, humorous, and most importantly hopeful.  The visuals are excellent and full of imagination. the acting is top notch. It is also full of very creative references to many previous sci-fi films and authors. There is plenty of action, but it is not nonstop action and explosions. It is what I would call thoughtful. It is also quite funny at times, much more so than most "comedy" films. While some may find it a bit slow as compared with the usual nonsense that masquerades as entertainment today, it is truly an excellent, inspiring, and enjoyable film that is highly recommended.Unfortunately settles for a lackluster and uninspired second half "I want you to take me to the place I saw when I touched this." After having seen the trailer for Tomorrowland, I didn't have very high expectations for it, but once I heard Brad Bird was directing this project I knew I had to see it because everything he had done up to this point was amazing. Ratatouille is one of my favorite animated films and The Incredibles was also an entertaining one. I have heard great things about his first animated film, Iron Giant, but I haven't seen it. Tomorrowland is his second live action film after having directed the latest Mission Impossible sequel which was also quite impressive (that Abu Dhabi scene was breathtaking), so there was no reason for me to doubt Bird and I was ready to give him my full support. I've got to give him a lot of credit for taking a risk by directing this unique project instead of accepting to make the Star Wars sequel, and in a way Tomorrowland feels refreshingly original. Bird also co-wrote the screenplay along with Damon Lindelof (one of the writers of my favorite TV series, Lost) so I raised my interest again considering they were involved. Unfortunately this is by far Bird's weakest film, but I still had a decent time at the movies.  The film opens with Frank Walker (George Clooney) speaking directly to the audience and explaining what the future holds for the planet in a rather pessimistic tone, but he is constantly interrupted by a young teenager named Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) who wants him to be more optimistic. So Frank begins by explaining that the future wasn't always as bad as it looks now, and in a flashback we are introduced to that time when as a young boy (Thomas Robinson) he invented a jet pack in order to try to impress a judge at a science fair named Nix (Hugh Laurie). The only problem was that it didn't actually fly so Nix wasn't impressed. However, he did catch the attention of a young girl, Athena (Raffey Cassidy), who gives him a special pin and asks him to follow them from a distance. What Frank discovers is a fascinating futuristic place where all dreams are possible. Somewhere along the way something goes wrong and we are back in the present where we are introduced to Casey's story. She also discovers a pin similar to the one Frank was given and is fascinated by the visions she gets of this wonderful place. Destiny will lead her to search for Frank and try to find a way to return to this place, but along the way she experiences several setbacks as many people try to stop her from reaching him. Tomorrowland begins with a very promising and gripping first half and I was completely engaged with the story. The visuals were impressive and the action scenes very entertaining. Britt Robertson was delivering a strong lead performance and the quest to reach Tomorrowland felt incredibly refreshing and unique. She shared a strong chemistry with George Clooney and her upbeat optimism contrasted perfectly with Clooney's pessimism. There is no denying the level of ambition this film has, but unfortunately the second half of the film doesn't deliver on the promising premise and the ending was very bland. My interest fell completely and I lamented the fact that the film couldn't maintain that same level of intensity delivered during the first half. Hugh Laurie is a great actor, but as the antagonist he never really felt the part. The film ran out of steam and imagination pretty quickly and delivers a somewhat predictable and uninspired ending.  The film is also pretty heavy handed in delivering its upbeat message (which is recurrent in most Disney movies) of never giving up on your dreams and being optimistic towards life despite all the negative things surrounding us. The fact that there have been tons of films reiterating the "you are special" message to young adolescents also hurts the movie quite a bit. But I did have a great time during the first hour of the film so I'm still going to give it a mild recommendation. Rafael Cassidy delivers one of my favorite performances of the film as Athena. Dave Clark also has a couple of hilarious scenes playing a Secret Service agent. Tommorowland could've been a great film, but it runs out of imagination pretty quickly and settles for a lackluster ending.  http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/Could've been a 9/10. But then there was endless preaching. In this movie the reason for the entire conflict remains in the dark until the very end, which is a very daring idea. I thought it was pulled off kinda nicely, although it did somewhat frustrate me, but not too much, because it helped me relate to the main protagonist. I thought that was neat. The story was great, the character arcs were solid, the acting was decent, the visuals were good. The only thing I didn't like was that I was sometimes confused about why the focus was on this or that character. I got the impression that some quite important scenes got cut. At one point - I'm guessing 75-80% into the movie - I was prepared to give a 9/10 rating or even higher. This is very rare for me. I can probably count the movies that I rate higher than 8.5/10 on two hands. But then something terrible happened... The preaching began. And it didn't end. It went on and on. It just didn't end. Even the final moments were all about the preaching. I got so annoyed that I started cursing. So when I was done watching, my rating dropped a whole three points. You can probably tell, I don't like preachy movies. I don't like them at all. Can you tell? I bet you can tell. How could this awesome movie get screwed up so badly by unneccessary, relentless, unbearable preaching? Who made this terrible decision? So close. So damn close. I'm so unbelievably disappointed. It could've been one of my all-time favorite movies, it had everything. But they just had to mess it up. They just couldn't help themselves...You kinda have to be my age to appreciate it's mystical megnetism... This movie is done in a style that literally doesn't exist anymore in movies...the style takes you back to a time that was "magical", to when Disneyland was brand new, and Disneyworld Orlando was in construction...Tomorrowland is not just scifi, it is the magic of what our futures can hold. Never mind that the movie itself is a bit choppy in presentation, with a story line that is, frankly, hard to follow at times. Crazy as the story may seem at times, it always keeps you wondering what's next...Either I am slow or just disconnected but after five viewings To have ridden that amusement ride at Disneyland and to have attended the 1964 World's Fair should have spoken to my sentiments, but not until I saw dreamers through this lens did this story connect for me. Maybe they can create a TV show at Disney about this story.A very good imaginative movie - makes one think! As a previous poster mentioned, you must consider who this movie is aimed at - probably at a teenage audience, and its goal seems to be to entertain, but also to make one question, and to think - I felt the acting was great, the scenes were great - the main reason I didn't give it a ten, but a nine - was because of the brief sermon about the religion of today - global warming, climate change, melting icebergs, crap that relies on computer models that have been wrong again and again. Overall, a great inspiring movie - with some good comedic moments -Loved it. I love most sci-fi, and while this feels like a children's film I remember seeing the adverts for it and thinking it would be good. And I've got to say, I really loved it. I am so surprised at the critics response to this though - What is their problem? It's a great film, has a brilliant message throughout of hope and promise and not giving up, even when it seems hard. The technology displayed in the film is really fun, I love the ideas and I they were executed very well. There was one time where the green screen didn't quite pan out when they were ascending the tower, but on the whole the effects were really well done. The acting, the cast, (Loved seeing Hugh Laurie in there) were all really well done too. I found this film to be heartwarming and fun, easy to watch and kept me entertained too. I'd have loved to have seen more of Tomorrowland, And I want to see a Tomorrowland 2 please."We all live in future world" RELEASED IN 2015 and directed by Brad Bird, "Tomorrowland" is a sci-fi/adventure starring Britt Robertson as a smart, positive teen teeming with scientific interest and George Clooney as a former kid-genius now disillusioned. In order to prevent the end of the world, they team-up with a curious girl (Raffey Cassidy) on a mission to return to "Tomorrowland," a futuristic world on a parallel plane. Hugh Laurie plays the political leader in Tomorrowland. This is a Disney production that cost a whopping $190 million with another $140 million tacked on for marketing. While it brought in a respectable $209.2 million worldwide ($93.4 million in North America), it was considered a disappointment due to its high cost. "Tomorrowland" is a fun, compelling fable or a fairy tale about what happened to our positive outlook of the future and how can we get it back. To be expected by the presence of a teen and a girl as the protagonists, the target audience seems to be pubescents and adolescents, but there's just as much for adults to enjoy with Clooney and Laurie, not to mention elements of Star Trek (the future, androids, robots, etc.) and the Terminator films (ditto). There are several thrilling action sequences with the unexpected one in the shop being my favorite. The opening is a little convoluted and the action sequence with the boy, his jet-pack and the robots in Tomorrowland takes you out of the realm of quasi-realism and into cartoonish fantasy. This turned me off and I was tempted to tune out but, thankfully, the tone quickly turned more reasonable and the story perked up with the focus on Casey (Robertson) and Athena (the girl). The ending, while drawn out, conveys a positive message. THE MOVIE RUNS 130 minutes and was shot in Enderby, Vancouver &amp; Surrey, British Columbia. WRITERS: Damon Lindelof &amp; Brad Bird. GRADE: B+A unique and fun film plot Tomorrowland, 2015. *Spoiler/plot- Tomorrowland, 2015. A pre-teen girl finds a mysterious ring and once it is worn transports you to another world full of amazing technological tools and people. She works to learn more about the ring's origin and tracks down the reluctant ring's owner to return to the magical futuristic world. *Special Stars- George Clooney, Hugh Laurie, Britt Robertson. *Theme- Imagination can solve much of our problems. *Trivia/location/goofs- Filmed in Louisiana, USA. Closely based on Walt Disney thoughts and work in his theme parks plans in 1952. Watch for all the 'hidden Mickeys' in this film scenes. *Emotion- A unique and fun film plot idea. Weaves into the film visuals some futurist ideas that Walt Disney incorporated into his theme park.  *Based On- Disneyland's Tommorrowland area them park area ideals and purposes.A preachy mess While the movie had decent production values, the story/script was just a fragmented mess, frequently bordering on nonsensical. I found myself asking "why did that just happen?" over and over again. Suspect this is one of those projects where multiple writers were brought in re-working and re-working the story. The preachy ending seemed like an unintentional parody of some left- wing think tank grade school recruiting video, completely consistent with George Clooney's politics.  The acting was decent, especially the kids, but their best intentions were doomed by what they had to work with. Also, I would expect most kids would find this movie too long, and too confusing to be very entertained by it.What? Why didn't Tomorrowland receive higher reviews? It's a lovely adventure story of hope and imagination. It's a fairytale land for the curious. What? Why didn't Tomorrowland receive higher reviews? It's a lovely adventure story of hope and imagination. It's a fairytale land for the curious. It's an innocent feel good film and reminiscent of Disney's 1997 Meet the Robinsons. The movie does leave you feeling something powerful. It does make you want to get up and do something. I love that it's so very uplifting. It's not a film that is going to blow your mind, it's not dark and gritty but give it a shot. I wouldn't even call it just a popcorn movie.Cynical need not apply... A great movie as long as you take it for what is, a good adventure. Watch it with an open mind. We could all do with a little more hope... For me this movie was fun and carried a poignant message, about doing something with our future. It is very easy to sit back, be cynical and do nothing. We are told that the future is going to be awful for all of us, global warming, over population etc... Back in the 50s and 60s the message was different, why has the message changed? Back then it was known about over population and the need for change. Do we need to believe the message that we are told, if we don't agree why can't we do something to change it? Maybe this would have an positive effect on the numbers of people today having to take anti-depressants. Any way enough of that, glad to get that off my chest... :-)  The movie doesn't take itself seriously. I particularly liked that the use of the word "bollocks" towards the end, very unDisney like. There are some great effects, although they didn't go overboard. I liked the cameo appearances (teachers preaching disaster) by the two actors who played scientists in Stargate Atlantis. Also Kathryn Hahn as the one of the owners of the Scifi store. I particularly liked the conversation between Casey and her father:  Casey Newton: There are two wolves who are always fighting. One is darkness and despair. The other is light and hope. The question is... which wolf wins? Eddie Newton: The one you feed. Spoiler alert! We're feeding the wrong one... So that was my 2 cents...Do not listen to all the idiots who call this film a snooze-fest. I don't get what modern movie-goers problems are. It seems nobody has any suspension of disbelief or patience when watching a movie. It's the same thing that happened with Godzilla (2014) where people complained we didn't see enough of Godzilla himself. Hasn't anyone from this generation heard of build-up or the idea of holding back? Of course not, because we've all been over showered with non-stop exposure to that kind of content with over the top action cheese fests like The Avengers. People need to realize that less is more. I've been going around online after seeing Tomorrowland (2015) and reading reviews. To be honest, I'm shocked at some of these people's reactions. As of Saturday May 23rd, the film holds a 49% on rottentomatoes, which to me, is pitiful. Now, with the case of Tomorrowland and what people should realize, it's not all about the world of Tomorrowland itself, but instead, the idea of Tomorrowland. *SPOILER* The pin that she receives is not actually a gateway to the land of tomorrow, but instead, turns out to be a teaser or commercial for Tomorrowland. The creators send out the pins to creative and imaginative people as invitations, asking them if they want to go to help evolve the world of tomorrow. The moral of the story is one that's actually true and very important, not preachy as some overly-sensitive people are making it out to be. It's telling people to go ahead and create what you want to see rather than just waiting around from someone else to do it. Who knows? You may be extremely talented in that area. You'll never know until you try. It's up to us to create the world of tomorrow and that's what the movie is more or less about. Besides that, it's a very well-paced action film with amazing performances from George Clooney and Britt Robertson. It's constantly moving around from location to location as more and more information about Tomorrowland is revealed. It's a tightly and perfectly executed script that doesn't reveal too much all at once, or drags out information for too long. The timing is perfect, the acting is superb, the visuals are impressive, and the idea is captivating and one that a lot of people should follow. So, in short, please do not listen to those online complaining about it being a boring film or anything like that. Just keep in mind the movie isn't really all about Tomorrowland, but the idea of it and how we can get there. It's there for a few minutes, but it's just a teaser. Go check it out!~Eye Opener While this movie has received many critical reviews claiming it is a loss of money, it is the complete opposite. When looking for a film that is both family friendly, and educating Tomorrowland is definitely the one to watch. It teaches everyone to never stop believing in themselves, and to always keep dreaming, Walt Disney says that "... This whole thing started with a dream and a mouse." The future part in the movie comes with a bit of a surprise but opens your eyes due to the fact that it makes you realize that the future really is in your hands. It teaches you that you have the power to change it and that the time to take action in now, after all the future is tomorrow. With the glimpse of what it could be through the eyes of an optimist, it also looks through the pessimistic point of view, showing you the good and the bad and how it matters when you take charge.An instant favorite! I can't figure out what the critics (who gave this negative reviews) are thinking! This is every bit the most imaginative, epic, entertaining film you could ever hope to see in the theater. My wife and I (in our 40s) along with our two kids (age 9 and 12) all absolutely LOVED this film! For a film to equally excite and entertain all members of the family as this one did is truly something special. Add to that the wonderful and welcome positive messages of finding good in yourself and others and being the change you want to see in the world (among others). This was not only a visual treat, but a delight in every way from the acting to the storytelling. Look, I can be picky too, but those who are picking on this film must be the ones who didn't get a Tomorrowland pin. (You'll have to see the movie to find out what that means.) :-) ENJOY! P.S. This movie will not appeal to negative people. Those who are critical of it are showing their true colors, without even realizing it. If you consider yourself a positive person, a dreamer, or a visionary... go see this film and be inspired. Everyone else, just shut your trap... this obviously wasn't for you, and the world doesn't revolve around you. Sure, we're all entitled to our own opinions, but it saddens me to think that many people will not see this movie because of some very vocal naysayers. Don't allow anyone to rob this wonderful cinematic experience from you. Seriously, if everyone could take to heart the message of this film, we could very well change the world.Terribleland This movie failed to be anything other than utter rubbish with a few cool CG effects thrown on top,the graphics failing to mask the stench of rotten acting, dense pseudo-science and strained plot beneath. It is the film making equivalent of masturbating on the bus, spraying immature actors all over the place. Despite desperate attempts to create excitement the film failed to create any sense of urgency, empathy or fascination. My Wife and I were both astonished to hear a laugh from another human being (we assume) in the row behind us at one point. We can only conclude we are surrounded by idiots. Either that, or George Clooney's misleading marketing team has infiltrated Australian cinemas near you!Offensively shallow Aside from a horribly rushed plot, the irritating know-it-all unnatural teenage genius who doesn't ever say anything smart or what would at least sound like her own thoughts, aside from the rape of Isaac Asimov's story - as if someone had read just the beginning and the end of it without getting the message - as a Ukrainian, I am highly offended that the movie had used the actual footage from the mass protests which took place in Kiev in 2014. Many people had died that day at the Independence Square in Kiev, defending their freedom of assembly and democracy in Ukraine. Many police officers who had been thrown by the illegitimate government to battle their own people at the streets had fallen that day too. Our country is still torn because of the tragic events of 2013/2014, the community is an open wound. When I have seen these events crammed into a sappy disaster montage, I was not only shocked, I almost felt like I have had a flashback to a year before, which had left me with a sour taste for the rest of the movie. And then the creators of this schlock have the nerve to tell us that the reason for all human violence is a sci-fi techno babble antennae, that "projects bad vibes"?! This movie is heinous.Incredibly Disappointing When the director of "The Incredibles" signed for this film, I was looking forward to the same amount of humor and exhilaration present in that animated masterpiece, something similar to what the little boy expresses when he realizes he can run on water. Nothing remotely close occurs in "Tomorrowland", a film that suffers from having too big a budget and hardly any original or exciting thoughts. It is also hindered by the fact that almost all of the actors appear clueless and not quite matching their characters. There's something about George Clooney being suave when needed and bit of an oddball in some other cases, but he's no Harrison Ford or Tom Cruise, and though the lead actress is pleasant to look at, she makes you wonder if casting directors shouldn't go through a more comprehensive training. Just recently "Mad Max" showed how an apocalyptic universe can be created with the use of minimum CGI, giving the film and story more weight because it felt real. "Tomorrowland" has some gorgeous computer graphics and way too many visual effects that must have caught a good deal of money but don't add much to the dramatic, action, or comedy scenes. They distract. The premise was interesting, and I liked the idea that girls are giving important roles, but as I said before the introduction is sluggish, and the movie never recovers from it. Traveling through multi-dimensions has been explored before with even more complex concepts, and the results have been spectacular. We can think of "Back to the Future", "The Matrix" among others, and some of the "technology" that pops here has been displayed to a much better use and without overdoing the clunkiness in shows that some people might consider cheesier but a lot more fun. Do you remember "Lost in Space?" I had flashes of "Aliens", "The Transformers", "The Rocketeer" among others, and though there was a lovely recreation of the fifties. There is not much to commend in the film. It's like a dark ages of cinema took over whatever inspiration went in, leaving not much but a pretty, loud, expensive, but expensive package.  I remember a few years ago when "The Return of the King" was criticized for its many endings, well, I did experience quite a bit of anxiety and pain by watching the endless final scenes in this film as the point was made over, and over, and over, and over, and sadly enough another modern masterpiece came to mind as flashes of "Ex Machina" went by. Yes, money can buy a lot but it's hardly the currency Hollywood needs for true imagination or inspiration. This is a film that was 130 minutes too long.Smug and preachy George Clooney cannot resist being smug and preachy apparently. The basic premise is good and there are pretty good performances from the younger cast but Clooney is like a flat edge on a car tire. Whenever he is on screen, things go askew. It is really sad and disappointing because I could see a good movie in it but instead they opted for whiny and preachy. A big surprise too because Brad Bird's other films were good. I can only assume Clooney insisted on changes. The girl who plays Athena does really good and I will bet we hear a lot more from her. The actor playing the young version of Frank was also impressive.  Something that really bothers me was reading that Disney scrapped plans for Tron 3 because this movie flopped. Why can Hollywood not understand that it is not the TYPE of movie, it is CRUMMY movies that people do not like.Chucky Meets Disney The PG rating for this movie gives a false impression that your kids are safe to watch this movie. Our family was horrified by the decapitation of a human-looking robot head by a child-looking robot, the child-looking robot being traumatically hit by a pickup truck, and then the holding of a charred human-looking robot skull. At that point, we had seen enough and left. I wish we could have been spared these graphic images. The theme question of the film is: How can we fix the future? A goal, which is never realized. Practically speaking, I wondered why the producers ironically lacked the effort of contributing to an actual better future for our children with the unnecessary violence and gore. Maybe all the intelligent and constructive script writers are somewhere in tomorrowland, wherever that may be.Seriously, this was the worst movie I've ever seen. I was in the theatre, with my girlfriend and my popcorn....so I actually stayed until the very end. Believe me, if I was watching this on video, I'd have stopped it early. It is UNBELIEVABLY BAD. As if they didn't even try to make a decent movie. The writing was atrocious. The CGI was terrible. Even if the movie is geared toward small children, you'd think they'd put something in it to keep an adult at least slightly interested. But nope, nothing. Let me give you an idea on the writing. First off, all of the crazy gadgets and 'future' stuff - it all happens completely at random. For instance, you want to get away from 10 machines attacking you with lasers? Well just hop into a bathtub and push a button....and it will convert into a rocket and launch you 50 miles in the air and into the lake. And it will even deploy lifejackets and a full meal will appear in front of you. And all this happens in 5 seconds! How marvelous, the world of tomorrow. And how wondrous it is to see the city of the future. Right in the center, covering 10 city blocks, we see a triple-decker swimming pool thing, where a guy jumps about 40 stories through 3 magically suspended swimming pools, and then he reverses and shoots right back up again - all without even moving his arms or legs. The CGI is so bad it looks like a watercolor painting. And how about 50 robots attacking 2 little kids (our heroes), but they destroy all the robots easily by jumping in the air, doing Karate....destroying all the robots in 20 seconds. Marvelous! How about the fact that Einstein and Tesla built a hidden rocket that all you do is jump in, push a button, and in 20 seconds it transports you through other dimensions? How spectacular! Seriously though, the CGI is so completely lazy and awful - it's no better graphics than watching a cartoon on television. I know my paragraph structure is not the best here, but man, it's hard to list the awful points of this movie separately, because they all mesh together. As for dialog....how about this for giving us a sense of 'wonder'? We see the 'city of the future' for the first time. How do we know things are different and spectacular? Well we overhear a young girl talking to her parents. "Please write us"...."Awww Dad, it's only 20 light years away". This was one of about 20 times where I just had to put my head in my palm and just shake my head and try to laugh lol. And oh, the close-up of children's faces as the narrator gushes on poetically about having hope for the future, feeding our good thoughts and not our bad thoughts, all the poetry....it makes anyone over the age of 12 want to puke. Oh one thing I forgot to ad. The 'hero' kids are really smart. How do we know that they are smart? Well for instance, this girl's dad is a NASA engineer, and he's designing a new circuit. But it's not working. So he's sitting there studying it. And then the girl just passes through the room....but she takes literally 2 seconds to lean over his shoulder and adjust the wires to get the circuit working. Wow, how wondrous!! My hero!! I could go on, but trust me on this. They didn't even try to make a good movie.Not what Disney Himself could Have envisioned where this Fantasy went First I clicked the spoiler alert so I would not get "blacklisted". I don't write move reviews; but this time I could not ignore it. I remember Disney Land and the Fantasy created by Walt Disney and a place to forget your world troubles and be a kid again if you were not a kid. I did find the movie interesting except for the glaring scenes where Human beings being incinerated for no reason at all by androids disgusting. This ruined the expected "fantasy" the movie setup in the trailers; Tomorrow Land and place where good by Science is created to benefit human kind. Yes I know the world is a hard and cruel place and there are far too many movies already portraying that; BUT a Disney MOVIE.....Look Who's Preaching Veiled in sparse, mysterious promotion, TOMORROWLAND is, well, kind of based on the section of Disneyland providing a retro-reversed future, viewed through the awe-inspired eyes of the 1950's when true Science Fiction reigned and dreams were storybook creative and Utopian deluxe. Starting out as a ROCKETEER meets CONTACT, we have two young heroes ‚Äì first a brilliant boy who will grow into George Clooney; and then a determined girl who receives a magical pin to enter the titular location that includes a monorail (sans the rail) and other futuristic CG visuals, as if George Lucas created a live-action JETSONS... But Steven Spielberg seems the nostalgic influence of director Brad Bird. Unfortunately, as we're detoured into a clunky road picture involving intrepid kids and banal villains, it's more of a limp GOONIES than a Millennial CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. The lead character, Casey Newton, has a "special" gift, especially heightened when she receives that device, allowing her to glimpse into a strange new world, introducing that splendid location teased upon before detouring back on our "filthy" present time. The action sequences are shot well enough, but there's never a legitimate reason to go from one point to the next. And as Brit Robertson overacts through this big budget blockbuster, she'd be perfect for a Nickelodeon TV movie or sit-com... Not that our A-list George Clooney is that much better. Grumpy and lethargic, when his eccentric former boy genius Frank Walker engages in physical activities, it's as awkward as the non-chemistry with his young partner ‚Äì think Doc Brown and Marty McFly, on Valium. And from the very onset, there's another young girl whose purpose shouldn't be spoiled¬Ö She winds up taking away from what Robertson should have had: a genuine connection with Clooney. Instead, the trio, together during a supposedly pivotal arc, seem like they're rehearsing for three different movies at the same time¬Ö and badly. Calling TOMORROWLAND preachy, as some mainstream critics have had to reluctantly admit, is an understatement ‚Äì and an insult to films with a more subtle/less overwhelming message intact: not uncommon in the Sci-Fi genre, especially going back to the Atomic Era 50's. Yet the final doomsday monologue by Hugh Laurie, while reminiscence of Michael Rennie's anti-nuke lecture at the peak of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, is more annoyingly hypocritical (coming from Disney) than overall effective. Too silly to be deep and too complicated to be involving, TOMMOROWLAND doesn't feel especially catered to any particular age group. Basically, director Brad Bird and co-scriptwriter Damon Lindelof have taken us for a long misleading ride. And the irony is... they meant to.Mindless Brainwashing for children In this movie, a young teenage girl keeps sneaking out of the house at night on her motorcycle to try to save an obsolete NASA launch platform which is due for demolition because she wants to go to the stars. *sigh She then disappears from her house for days and when she returns home from Tomorrowland, her Dad is happily working in his garage without even noticing she's been missing? Seriously? The message is that the world is doomed for destruction because of global warming and overpopulation and our positive thinking can save it. Now, do we trust the messenger? Please do some research into Walt Disney, who he was as person and what he truly believed before you swallow this garbage.  I felt like I was watching one of those documentaries they forced down our throats in school about nuclear bombs and the coming ice age and please save the world albeit, with a much larger budget. Don't let the Disney corporation brainwash your children. Of course we should all look after the world and world peace would be wonderful, but if you really believe that overpopulation is a massive issue then what is the solution? Remove peoples ability to reproduce maybe?? And then tax the very air that I breathe? Wake up! And by the way, is it just me that found the scene of the young (dying robot) girl declaring her love for a man slightly distasteful?Such a boring and senseless movie We watched the movie yesterday and the 3 of us fell asleep in the cinema as the movie was that boring and senseless. I haven't seen such a bad movie for ages as i constantly watch movies once or twice a week and really adore Disney movies in general. This was not Disney-like as i know it. Really not recommending. I think the film has only good marketing and George Clooney in it which makes it interesting for other people, but it is the first GC-movie which has really disappointed me. A wannabe-pseudo science-fiction film without a red line. I don't understand how someone thinks this is amazing.  Best regardsTomorrowland is why todayland is so lost The only thing that wasn't shallow about this film was the depths of its triteness and shallowness.  Once again Disney has reduced the problems of our modern world to a fantasy, a fantasy where one lone hero saves the future.  It perpetuates everything that is broken with the modern, mainly American, psyche.  I can;t even begin to get into the ridiculousness of the plot.  Honestly, Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs looks like Hamlet compared to this McMovie.  Ug, I think I got dumber just watching it.Better off Watching Pitch Perfect 2 or Avengers 2 Again If you have the mind set of a child, this might be a movie for you but again you would be bored and feel tossed around this uneven plot. It's not exciting, it's dull, and using ones imagination will not make this better... Britt Robertson stop trying to act like a teen, your character might as well have been played by Dove Cameron because then she could have sung her part and maybe made it more interesting.... George stick to what it is you do best.....I'm not sure what that is but you get my drift. Next time a movie is advertised as a look into the future, remember sometimes they will disappoint you with only five minutes of the said future.....Disney is brainwashing kids in a super-crap movie How can anyone approve movies where kids do impossible things without even getting a scratch? This is even worse than Jackass. Kids get killed by believing that they also can do dangerous things - And I don't C A R E that it is a fantasy movie... Kids do actually believe many things they see on TV. So, already 30 minutes in, several kids should have died doing things they did - and yet not a single scratch, barely - more smiling and keeping going on. Disney is really up to no good and it is not something new. How can they still put millions on this crap instead of something more productive.  Don't see the movie especially with your kids - Waste of time!what the hell How in the world does this crap get a 6. what ever it is if all the reviews i have read give it a 1 star what a load of crap i only watched the opening 10 minutes of this movie to declare it a automatic delete from my computer ..... the kid is going around the city on his jet pack and what a dodgy job they do...... they might as well just left the green screen behind him green..... This movie is a disgrace to technology of our time seriously. i wish i could give it a no star out of 10 would encourage everything one has or picked up this movie to put it down immediately and save your time if it is precious to you. there are way too many things that are wrong with this movie and you could possibly write a book on how this movie is terrible i was actually relatively excited to watch this movie as they showed a better piece on the trailers, just goes to show how you should never take a trailer at face value as this film was complete and utter crap and thankfully i realized it early on before it could take anymore of my precious time. THANK YOU WALT Disney YOU HAVE DISGRACED YOURSELF ONCE AGAIN... KEEP AWAY FROM MOVIE MAKING PLEASE ....The worst use of the word tomorrow since that grating song from Annie Remember when you were a kid and you went to a Disney Park for the first time? And you got to experience space rides and other stuff that they're going to do in the future courtesy of Walt Disney and his Imagineers? Well, forget all that; this movie may have the name Tomorrowland, but has nothing to do with the entertainment, imagination, thrills, creativity, or wonder of its amusement park namesake. There are a few impressive visuals, but no story of any substance to give those visuals a reason to exist. The plot is paper thin and lumbers along as it goes nowhere. Even the cast seems to be bored, and have little to do of consequence. Not much happens, and from what little does happen, nothing ever clicks as innovative or interesting. It's puzzling what this movie's makers were shooting for. There are some random and disturbing scenes that are bizarre and out of place, and these only add to the audience's confusion.  George Clooney mugs and annoys the audience with his arrogant approach to his lead role. His line reads usually consist of long winded soap box sermons, usually to the tune of global warming. He mocks the audience with his attitude that everybody except him is stupid.  The title is deceptive and this movie has no right using it. None of the fun, family friendly atmosphere, or creativity suggested by the title is here. Save your money.
Black Mass is a decent film, but it could have been great. Black Mass: A Near Miss 'Black Mass' is another is a line of crime dramas set in Boston. The film will inevitable be compared to 'The Departed.' And it falls short in the comparison. The acting is top rate, and Depp is much better, not as hammy, than the comic portrait of a crime boss by Nicholson in 'The Departed.' Depp is genuinely threatening in the film and the make-up job given him in the film adds to the fright.  'Black Mass' has the look of a 70s television show, and that works in its favor. In fact, the overall look of the film is exquisite. That, and the acting, are the two best things in the film. However, the movie is both too much and not enough.  'Black Mass' tries to cover too much and thus it lacks focus. This is where 'The Departed' succeeds. While 'The Departed' has many layers and character, it has a focus: the Southie, Billy. 'Black Mass' doesn't have a main theme, a main character, a main protagonist or antagonist. There are a bunch of characters in tense situations with some irony and symbolism. However, in the end, there is nothing to hold onto, no lessons, no emotions, love or hate, for any characters.  As I was watching, both my film buddy and I thought the same thing: Scorsese could have made this story work with his writing and directing. We also thought that in an era of long- form television that it could have made a great 10-20 episode show. Then it could have gone into depth about the childhood relationships between crime boss Bulger, his FBI friend Connolly and Whitey's brother, State Senator Billy Bulger.  As miniseries, it could have more deeply explored the racial tensions between the Irish and Italians with the African Americans stuck in the middle. It could have taken a deeper look into Boston politics and corruption, police corruption, and more. The miniseries could have also gone further into the Irish American funding of the IRA. As it was, it touched on each of those issues in an unsatisfactory fashion. If the film had taken a deeper look into any ONE of those themes, it would have made for a better movie.  Rating: Matin√©e For the great look and outstanding acting, I suggest you see it on the big screen. Otherwise, wait for the miniseries. Hey, a man can dream.  Peace, Tex SheltersDepp is Great...Movie Itself? Not So Much. Black Mass serves as a nice redemption for the floundering career of Johnny Depp, who has leaned more on quirky voices and loud makeup than his actual skills in recent years. His portrayal of mob boss Whitey Bulger is a powerhouse performance and easily his best since he first introduced the world to Jack Sparrow. It's too bad the movie as a whole doesn't fair quite as well. Despite a great cast and some interestingly insane source material, somehow a movie about one of America's most infamous criminals feels more like small claims court. Director Cooper focuses his narrative on Bulger's less-than-legal partnership with the FBI. It's a fascinatingly close-knit community we witness (agents, felons, politicians, and families alike) in which loyalty and corruption go hand-in-hand. It's a grimy yet quiet 70's-feel gangster film that engages its audience nearly as much as it reminds them of better films. Therein lies its big problem: What is Black Mass offering that hasn't already been perfected in other gangster films? Unfortunately, instead of a true movie-making vision, it's like a guy watched every crime drama from the last 40 years and just spit out a less-interesting copycat. Not that a counterfeit of something great can't still have its positives: the score is beautiful and the performances from the top-notch cast around Depp are nearly as superb as his, all of whom nail the oft-parodied Bostonian accent with aplomb. But with too many side plots to juggle, not enough cohesion to the storytelling, and an unfortunate lack of auteur vision, Black Mass just can't stand against the great American crime films of yore (Chinatown, Godfather, Goodfellas).What was the point? I swear to God I really really wanted to like this movie. I am kind of a fan of Bulger's for some sick reason and I felt like Johnny Depp was appropriately menacing and weird looking and did a good job with making the Violence believable. What failed was the writing. There is never really any attention paid to why Whitey was Whitey or how he got to be Whitey or why he wanted to be Whitey. His kid is dead his marriage ruined and he is just accumulating money to accumulate money? Why? He apparently has no vices to speak of except giving money to con men from the IRA. The whole thing just makes no sense. The whole thing just seemed apathetic.It could have been a real classic but they fornicated with the puppy yet again. It was just Depp looking weird and enjoying a WHitey Halloween costume while he strangled hookers and killed informants. Thanks Hollywood. I suspect you can blame the producers.Underwhelming I saw this movie with a bunch of my college friends (we are all in college). They all loved it. And I will say that Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton were fantastic in this movie, however, the movie lacked the qualities of a great mob movie. I have always been fascinated by the mob genre. I have watched the sopranos, goodfellas, donnie brasco, the godfather, and basically all mob movies under the sun. I feel like Johnny Depp and Edgerton are great at portraying their characters, but I feel like no other character was developed at all. Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the great actors of today, but Cooper just wasted his talents on a weak supporting role. I was also looking forward to see the inner workings of how Whitey Bulger came to power. I understand that he was a silent, cold-blooded mobster that used the FBI to become to be one of the most influential criminals in Boston. However, other then a few choking scenes and murder scenes, I would have liked Cooper to show more of the specifics of Bulger's rise to power. Also, we rarely see Bulger interacting in the everyday mob-life, but we always see how he handles unique, problematic situations all-the time. I would have liked to have seen one normal day in Whitey Bulger's life given the movie was only was 2 hours long.  Overall, a decent movie with great acting by Depp and Edgerton, but lacking on some of the finer details of a classic mob movie.  P.S. I could not take Ben Wyatt serious in that mustache.drudgery If you like slow, plodding movies full of unlikeable characters, by all means gear up for this sleep inducing film. Goodfellas is an action movie compared to Black Mass. There are a few good qualities here: top shelf production, excellent acting, a clear, concise story of characters making poor choices - leading to predictable consequences. But who cares? There's no entertainment here! None of these characters are worth giving a damn about, and the few sporadic scenes that offer any true value sit like islands on a still horizonless sea. But I learned something... Really? This might be the number one reason to sit through this boring expanse, and the info is not worth it. The scumbags are scumbags, the protagonist is a weak, shallow excuse for a law enforcer, and the other surrounding characters are bland at best (including Benedict, who for all his talent, brings nothing of note to an already white bread affair). Speaking of white bread - No culture what-so-ever, and often these fat, out of shape gangsters look absurd in their early 80's sunglasses and attire. There will be no awards given for costuming or make-up here. True Depp is transformed with prosthetics, but as a friend and I joked - his character is far exceeded by the likes of Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder. If you've seen the trailer, you've been robbed of one of the films three or four memorable moments. Interestingly, all of these good scenes are just spice to the meat of the film. This is not a good thing! When the main arc is dull, the violence (while realistic) lacks stylistic punctuation, and the constant voice overs are delivered with apathy... one wonders what the hell the director was thinking! Waste of time, even for fans of actors involved. my score? a disappointingly average 5 out of 10.If Goodfellas is a gourmet patisserie then Black Mass is an airport Cinnabon The intrigue of all crime movies relies on a simple idea: people are complex, but actions are not. Behind every reductive, one-word crime ‚Äî"murder," "theft," "extortion"‚Äì is a human with a motive and a history to support that motive. Part of the reason we follow the stories of criminals is to overlay ourselves on their paths, trace the steps around their intentions, and see where they turn where you would not. Great crime stories give us the opportunity feel our own humanity guide us through darkness. Unfortunately, I felt nothing while watching Black Mass. Heralded as a return to acting form for Johnny Depp, Black Mass tells the true-crime story of James "Whitey" Bulger, a mythologized, south-Boston crime lord who operated from the late 70's to early 90's. As an adaptation of the best-selling book of the same name by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, the film portrays the key years of Bulger's ascent to power in the Boston crime world, during which he acted as an FBI-informant through slick FBI agent (and Southie homeboy) John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). At the behest of Connolly and his less enthusiastic boss Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon), Bulger provides information that precipitates the downfall of the Italian mob, allowing his own Winter Hill gang to take over all aspects of Boston crime, from the drug trade to money laundering, and everything in-between. However, with such a compelling, cant-fail crime premise, the film is bafflingly hollow. Other than hearing a laundry list of crimes that Bulger supposedly spearheads, we almost never see any crimes being committed, other than the odd shotgun rampage or prostitute murder (both which felt sadly derivative for such gruesome scenes). Doors slam, money is exchanged, and men with furrowed brows walk hastily down empty alleys‚Äîbut it never feels like we are made to understand why. Where is the money coming from? What are Whitey's motivations? Who are the victims of these crimes, or rather, where are the commoners (for a film with such a large cast, it seems completely devoid of extras) of Boston at all? Even the undeniable Benedict Cumberbatch seems adrift and misused in his role as Whitey's state senator brother Billy Bulger. Director Scott Cooper chose to focus only on a handful of key years during Whitey's reign of terror, perhaps to draw focus on his peak instead of wasting time on his rise or fall. Unfortunately, the result is a dubiously avowed criminal juggernaut who feels‚Äìand sometimes looks‚Äîlike he is made out of paper. Much has been made of Depp's transformation into the balding, ghostly Bulger through the magic of makeup, prosthetics, and false teeth. He looks legitimately ghoulish throughout the film, yet the performance feels thin and insubstantial, perhaps less due to Depp's acting than to the camera's disinterest. Depp does has his moments, especially in one particularly tense scene where he slinks out of the shadows to confront Connolly's untrusting wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson), lurking over her like a pale, demonic shadow. During that scene, I felt like I was watching a horror movie. Afterwards, I could only lament the fact the rest of the movie didn't try harder to be a horror movie, or didn't try harder to be anything interesting at all. Black Mass has the trappings of a great film with solid performances, beautifully lit shots, and a wealth of source materials, making its ultimate failure that much more disappointing. Crime stories are a staple of American cinema and we accept them for their inherent limitations. However, in 2015 it's simply unacceptable to approach the making of a crime movie with absolutely no creative spirit. Several other reviews have likened Black Mass to a poor imitation of Goodfellas or other Scorsese films. If Goodfellas is the gourmet p√¢tisserie of crime movies, then Black Mass is an airport Cinnabon, a fluorescently lit sprawl of half baked, cookie-cutter crime characters we've all come to expect‚Äìa dash of angry FBI chief here, a sprinkle of disgruntled mob grunt there‚Äìwho delivered their lines and then seemingly evaporate into stale air. The movie runs over two excruciating hours yet fails to make plain the impact of the Bulger's crimes, resulting in a story which accomplishes the impossible feat of feeling both protracted and unfinished. Scott Cooper strives to portray Whitey Bulger as the boogeyman, an unstoppable nightmare whose actions are made infinitely more terrifying by the knowledge that they exist in reality. Instead, Black Mass is the kind of dream that you forget the instant you wake up. Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.Comprised of spectacular performances, Johnny Depp and Co. carry this run-of-the-mill B list Mob movie to relevance. Encompassed with episodic rhythm and an awfully conventional format, Scott Cooper mutates a story of rich soil capable of greatness to a detaching and routine crime film. Black Mass grasps only on the superficial layer as it focuses solely on documented events of the crime they organized. Due to this, the movie suffers as it seems to be merely a biography- laying out these horrific events in these specified timeframes but not putting any focus on the characters that performed it. All action, but none of the story that happens between that allows the audience to view who they are and what they're like. Black Mass fails to delve deeper into the roots, and this of course limits the scope of all the actors. Great mob cinematography such as The Godfather, Goodfellas, and the Sopranos- all of these were so great because they allowed the audience to see what the characters were like when they weren't shooting, beating, or plotting against people. That being said, in their limited boxes boy do these actors put on a show. Led by Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton, the audience can tell straight from the start that this cast reveled and lived their roles. With the amount of overwhelming, heinous events; the film had to have someone cold-hearted and sleazy, and woah did these actors become the epitome of that. However, due to this heavily limited character, the only "rise" the audience feels are from the bone-chilling actions that these men did. Black Mass fails to captivate. And when the closing credits roll a feeling of disappointment washes over you, as it feels like you just watched an episode on the ID channel with really, really good actors."Black Mass" is all but Great I try not to get my hopes up too much for certain movies, and "Black Mass" (which I got very excited about) just reminds me why. Oh, Scott Cooper... how did you manage to make one of the most twisted, unusual, and mysterious gangster stories into an emotionless web of a film? From acting to editing, there was so much wrong that it's almost surprising. My main issue was the nonexistence of a certain necessity: stakes. In all great mafia flicks, stakes are essential. Would "Goodfellas" have been as remarkable if it didn't feel like any wrong move would set off a universe-ending set of events? Would the "Godfather" have been considered the greatest film of all time if a war wasn't seconds away from breaking out? "Black Mass" managed to keep a story that easily could've had those steaks from having any at all. This was, of course, caused by the emotionless acting, but more on that in a second. But this film really made me not care if the protagonist (whether you consider that to be Bulger or Connolly) lives or dies; and in a mob movie, that is a worse crime than anything committed on screen. So the acting I blame entirely on Cooper. Every single actor did a great job with what they were given, but the problem is that they were given the wrong thing. For example, Depp was probably told to play a silent yet psychotic, friendly yet intimidating crime lord. Did he do that well? Absolutely. Is that who the character was written as? Not at all. Same goes for Joel Edgerton's - who I thought did the best job out of all of the actors - character, Jesse Plemons' character, and even smaller characters like Adam Scott's. All those actors did well, but not in the right parts. The list goes on with issues, so let's talk about why the movie got 2 stars rather than zero (therefore, let's talk about the positives). I've heard some critics discuss the overuse of violence in the film. Though there is quite a bit of violence, I thought it was used very tastefully. No blood was used where it didn't seem necessary, and personally, I think that the violence becomes numbing, which takes us even further into the mob guys' mentality on murder. Also, I thought the shooting locations were very well chosen, as they really captured the narrow-mindedness of the lead characters' lives. So should you see this movie? -If you love mafia movies of any shape or size, then go see it. -If you love Johnny Depp, wait until it comes out on demand. -If you don't love mafia movies, haven't seen many mafia movies, or just have none of the listed qualities above, then don't see this film.Good Not Quite Great Black Mass is a crime drama movie revolving around the true events behind the Winter Hill Gang and the gang's leader Whitey Bulger played by Johnny Depp. The premise for the film was very interesting as it played on Whitey Bulger's connections as his brother, William Bulger, played by Benedict Cummberbatch is a Massachusetts State Senator while one of his childhood friends John Connolly played by Joel Edgerton is an FBI agent. This an amazing premise however it was not fully executed as it focused mainly on Joel Edgerton's character and Cummberbatch's character felt out of place at times. This may have been a more realistic approach however I felt like they could have utilized Cummberbatch's character more in the film as it would have added two assets for Whitey. The Film is divided in three parts overlooking Whitey's almost twenty year reign. However because of this approach it leaves viewers wondering what happened in that time frame and feels as if it was forced to make the movie feel more like the actually events, so spread out. The cinematography and direction of the film is very crisp and sleek which makes the film a lot more enjoyable. The acting all together throughout the film is superb as it holds a stellar cast. I found Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton,Kevin Bacon and Benedict Cummberbatch to be all great. Depp's performance was electrifying and he should get an Oscar nod but I would not be surprised if he does not get one. Overall decent film 7/10Boring, uninspired crime drama I don't usually write reviews but I felt compelled to inform others about how awful this film was. And I want to prefice this by saying I love crime films and have seen the greats such as Goodfellas, the Godfather, and The Departed but this was just drivel.  Let's start with the acting: Johnny Depp plays Boston crime lord James "Whitey" Bulger and reveals virtually nothing about the character he plays aside from the violent actions he portrays. The supporting cast does nothing to make this a compelling story either with the exception of Joel Edgerton's John Connolly as a street-wise kid turned FBI agent loyal to Bulger's cause.  The pacing and dialogue are also the biggest culprits here. The film develops slowly leaving the watcher wondering if it will ever pick up to an emotional crescendo with only to find out the ride is as monotonous as your daily drive. Moreover, the dialogue feels like students taking turns reading out of a textbook. I know that the film is a biographic one but there's no need to have it feel as though you're reading a Wikipedia article.  Likewise, the musical score tries to underpin the uneasy feel of the movie but only works to put the viewer to sleep with its two tone rise and fall. None of the cinematography and shots of the scenes work to create anything worth capturing attention. There are shots of Southie that do convey the bleak outlook of Bulger's turf but they are few and far between as the film mostly focuses on the boring and uninspired dialogue and setting the actors are captured in such as living rooms, offices, dark bars, and car interiors.  If I was to summarize watching this film with an analogy I would describe it as eating and tasting a cardboard box.Sluggish Crime Saga with little Cinematic Flair "Out of the Furnace" director Scott Cooper's "Black Mass" qualifies as a gritty, atmospheric, but middling mobster melodrama that chronicles the life and crimes of James "Whitey" Bulger, a notorious Boston gangster with an Irish upbringing who evaded authorities for 16 years before justice eventually caught and convicted him for 11 homicides. Adapted from a thoroughgoing non-fiction bestseller by "Boston Globe" reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, this unsavory, R-rated, crime chiller provides "Pirates of the Caribbean" star Johnny Depp with a chance to atone for far too many silly, superficial comedies. Academy Award-winner Jack Nicholson did an imaginary take on this real-life sociopath in Martin Scorsese's memorable law and order epic "The Departed," a mob movie ten times more suspenseful than "Black Mass." Now, Depp stars as the infamous felon himself. Although he appears incredibly chilling as the bloodthirsty maniac who is currently serving two life sentences plus five years, nothing about Depp's performance reveals any insights about this heinous individual. Indeed, thanks to prosthetics galore, Depp bears a striking resemblance to Bulger, but nothing beneath his grim, tight-lipped portrayal yields a clue about the murderer's mindset. Reportedly, Bulger refused to talk to Depp about his life. Meantime, this is not the Depp that we have grown accustomed to in movies like the frivolous "Pirates" franchise, "The Lone Ranger," "Tusk," "Dark Shadows," and "Mortdecai." Instead, this is the Depp of "Public Enemies," "Donnie Brasco," and "Once Upon a Time in Mexico." As Bulger, Depp strangles a defenseless young harlot with a rope, beats an adversary to death with his bare fists, and mows downs an unarmed, but treacherous henchman with a carbine. Don't walk into "Black Mass" and imagine you're going to see something that will make you giggle with glee. Unquestionably, "Black Mass" constitutes a long overdue return to form for the immensely talented Depp. Critics have hailed his performance as Oscar worthy. As unforgettable as Depp is, the man who steals the show and delivers the best performance is Depp's co-star Joel Edgerton of "Warriors." Cast as corrupt FBI Agent John Connolly, who conspired with the real-life Bulger to shield him from prosecution, Edgerton emerges as nothing short of sensational. While Depp relies on prosthetics to impersonate Bulger, Edgerton shuns elaborate make-up and turns the tainted FBI agent into a sympathetic flesh and blood character. He gets under Connolly's skin and shows us what makes the man tick. A profane, violent, but episodic crime thriller, "Black Mass" covers familiar ground. Director Scott Cooper, who also helmed "Crazy Heart," neither pulls any punches in his casual depiction of mob violence nor does he startle us with any surprises. You've seen everything that Cooper stages here in other gangster movies. Essentially, "Black Mass" is an empire-building crime film, but Cooper doesn't recount either how Bulger established his empire or solidified it with his intimidating reputation. Instead, he dwells on episodes that earlier movies like "The Departed," "Goodfellas," "The Town," "Killing Me Softly," "The Friends of Eddie Coyle," and the two "Boondock Saints" thrillers have done before and done with greater panache. Basically, the action unfolds in five year increments, beginning in 1975 as a number of Bulger's cronies cut deals with the Feds to save their necks. Freshman scenarist Mark Mallouk and "Edge of Tomorrow" scribe Jez Butterworth neglect to explore the psychology behind the treachery that prompted Bulger's underlings to inform on him. Meantime, Cooper focuses almost entirely on the relationship between Bulger and Connolly. The subplot involving Whitey's older brother Billy could have been left on the editing room floor. Incredibly, "Black Mass" omits some of the more compelling incidents in the page-turning Lehr and O'Neill book. Specifically, the filmmakers have altered the events that brought Bulger and Connolly together as conspirators as well as some of the crimes.  A convicted bank robber who did 9-years in Alcatraz, Bulger masqueraded as a Robin Hood-style gangster around South Boston, but his fellow goons weren't fooled by his shenanigans. Ironically, loyalty among these thieves is the first casualty. As the film unfolds, Bulger henchman Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons of "Varsity Blues"), goes on the record swearing that he isn't a "rat!" On the other hand, FBI Agent John Connolly worshiped the ground that Bulger trod and refused to testify against him. Connolly grew up in the same blue-collar Irish neighborhood as Bulger. Whitey intervened in a fight where Connolly would have suffered grievously without his support. Connolly struggles to convince his wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson of "Kinsey") that loyalty supersedes morality. Nevertheless, her husband's adulation for Bulger repels her. Connolly sets out to recruit Bulger as a source, but Bulger balks at being an informant. Inevitably, Connolly forges an unholy alliance with Bulger, so the Bureau can crush the Mafia in Boston and he could claim credit for the demise of the Italians. Ultimately, Connolly sold his soul to the devil, while Cooper makes Bulger appear as sinister as Satan. Distinguished by its brooding cinematography, authentic production values, and documentary flavor, "Black Mass" succeeds more as a tour de force showcase for the actors than a landmark example of a gangster movie. A top-tier supporting cast, featuring "Sherlock" star Benedict Cumberbatch as Bulger's brother Billy, who carved out a reputation for himself in Congress as a man of the people, surround Depp and Edgerton. Kevin Bacon, David Harbour, and Adam Scott play Connolly's eloquent, well-tailored, FBI colleagues. Harbour delivers a powerful performance as the weak link in the group of FBI agents who turn a blind eye to Bulger's criminal activities as long as he furnishes them with information about the Mafia. As Bulger's amoral associates, Rory Cochrane, Jesse Plemons, and W. Earl Brown will make your skin crawl. Peter Sarsgaard rounds out the cast as one of Bulger's sadistic but ill-fated adversaries. Nobody gives a weak performance in "Black Mass." Sadly, for all of his crime-does-not-pay sentiments, Cooper has fashioned a dreary, sluggish crime saga devoid of any cinematic flair or unpredictable spontaneity.Ladies and Gentleman, The Academy Award for Best Male Actor goes to.........JOHNNY DEPP!!! The icy blue eyes of notorious Boston crime boss James "Whitey" Bulger stare out from the screen in Scott Cooper's "Black Mass" like the gaze of some confident jungle predator calmly lying in wait, holding his ground until the moment he moves in for the kill. And that same coolly calculated composure extends to every aspect of how the actor playing Bulger embodies the role, or rather disappears into it. But if Johnny Depp's mesmerizing performance ‚Äî a bracing return to form for the star after a series of critical and commercial misfires ‚Äî is the chief selling point of "Black Mass," there is much else to recommend this sober, sprawling, deeply engrossing evocation of Bulger's South Boston fiefdom and his complex relationship with the FBI agent John Connolly, played with equally impressive skill by Joel Edgerton. Something of an anti-"The Departed" (which was partly inspired by the Bulger case), the movie has an intentionally muted, '70s-style look and feel that may limit its appeal to the date-night multiplex crowd, but quality- starved adult moviegoers should flock to one of the fall's first serious, awards-caliber attractions. Not only that but Benedict Cumberbatch (who plays as a Senator and as Whitey's brother) has given a stellar performance. He is truly a talented person who gives his all in every film/show he acts. BOTTOM LINE: Johnny Depp deserves an Oscar, if not then at least a nomination. Truly worth watchingDepp has always been back, but Black Mass will be his Oscar winning film The only time I ever recall of being terrified of Johnny Depp as a character was in Sweeney Todd and I never thought he could top that performance.  But I stand corrected, his performance as Whitey Bulger is not only terrifying as hell but one of the best performances Depp has ever pulled off! This is the type of the film that makes you want more and more after each scene is done all the way towards the end, and the supporting characters really help Black Mass reach its full potential of hitting the right spots for a moviegoer. Scott Cooper did an amazing job in this biopic he also she be up for best director, Joel Edgerton steals the spotlight in some scenes and bloody nails it in all the screen time he gets. This film also has a nice funny side to it as well which really makes you laugh then BAM all seriousness. By far probably the best film I have seen this year! Deserves more than 10/10A superficial, generic, by-the-numbers "Gangster" flick--What a joke. Black Mass is a waste of your time and money. DO NOT see this. The number of well-known actors used in this film is a damn shame because every single role is such a cardboard cutout that any lesser-known actor wouldn't have made a difference. Depp plays "Whitey" Bulger, and to constantly remind the audience that he's a real bad guy, he gives stone-cold, eye piercing looks, he throws in the necessary run of the mill curses, kills a few unremarkable people throughout and that's it. Don't expect any action or colorful, well-written characters. Yes, this is based off a true story, but, in the context of the film, there is no significance; it doesn't matter--it's been done a ton before and it adds absolutely nothing new or refreshing to the genre. Except for a couple of interesting subplots (which are all quickly brushed off and "resolved" by a single line of dialogue in a following scene), this film has nothing going for it. And it really is a shame; there are hints of a better film that shine through every once in a while during its seemingly forever-feeling run-time, but, that's not to be had. There's not much more to say because this film really doesn't have much going for it. DON'T go to see this--it really is THAT bad.the life of the demented Crime boss is the name of the game. And there is no hero in this. No savior, and no happy tales at the end of the rainbow. This is blood and grit all the way through but it's not all in it. This movie shows the nature of man, a person, as we were shown the gradual change that happened to him as tragedies after tragedies happened to him, and thus show us the unraveling, the change that took him over through out the course of the movie. There is the love of the father, love of a son, and love of a brother. This things are what held him to the ground. It's what held him to be sane in my opinion. And so in the end, we were shown what it is that made him what he is, but still, I would guess many is with me in this that this is no excuse, for the crimes, unforgivable and most unthinkable. In fact, it was in my impression that the character that Johny Depp played was a psychopath. I mean he was calm, and smiling and unsuspecting, till the second he pulls a gun on you. That's how I call those types, not that I've associated myself with those kinds, or so I think, you never know. But since kids, I have got the sense that they were living in a rough neighborhood. And it is Brooklyn in the 70s and early 80s, so it seems justifiable to speculate that it is the kind of environment that would produce someone likely to be listed as FBI's most wanted list. As I said, there is no hero in this, just pure truth, and as it usually is, with a changing society where leaders, us secretary attorney, and some dude that'd take over, there is always, without a doubt, change, either for the good or bad and this is what I have observed in this movie. A change of leader, made this criminal group more deadly, but also, due to that same reason, that same group, meet an ugly decline. And since this is a society, that caters the good, I must say that it'd produce well, outstanding law enforcing, disciplined citizens, and as time goes by, ruthless, evil groups get disinfected. It's not really that black and white but what I mean is pretty simple.These High Ratings Are Fan Based, Not Quality Based Black Mass was such a boring movie. There, I said it.. Not only was it boring, but it was also confusing at several points which made it nearly impossible to enjoy while watching it for the first (and only) time. It isn't completely impossible, but there were far too many pieces missing throughout. I checked my watch an hour in and dreaded the fact that I still had another hour to sit through. Excessive swearing and random killing is all this movie was. Were the performances outstanding? Hardly. And this surprised me considering all of the positive reviews and famous names of people who were in it. In the end you're left with an overrated crime based "drama" movie that isn't worth watching and full of regret wishing you had bought that dessert rather than sitting through over 2 hours of whatever the hell that was. I was very disappointed.If you are looking for an overpriced chair to sleep in, then this movie is for you. The trailers for this movie were awesome, and contain 5 minutes of amazing acting, directing and writing. The other 117 minutes are a bitter disappointment. All the action in the entire movie is already in the trailer. Nothing else happens. I can think of no reason why anybody would want to pay money to watch this. This movie looks as though it was intentionally made to bore the audience. I can't imagine anything that could be done to make this movie more boring. Even a black screen for 122 minute would have been better because then you get to sleep. The movie moves at such a slow pace with so boring a plot and so many attempts at making everybody look good and being politically correct, that even the awesome Johnny Depp performances in the trailer look weak and halfhearted when put into context. Basically: Watch the trailers (they're awesome), but not the movie!Long and boring "Long and boring" are the first words that come to mind when exiting from this film, which seems strange because a gangster film which is boring is almost a contrast in words. Off-hand I can't think of another gangster film that had less action, suspense, or drama. Apart from the length and direction, the musical score is almost non-existent, which in a film of this nature trying to recapture bygone days, is a cardinal sin. Perhaps the worst feature of the film, though, is the acting, from Johnny Depp's poor imitation of Jack Nicholson to the Irish accents that come and go throughout the film. It's not all bad acting. For me, David Harbour ("End of Watch"), Dakota Johnson ("The Social Network") and Juno Temple ("Magic, Magic") stood out. This is a film you can surely miss.Did not like this movie at all Both my gf and I saw this just now and we both wanted to leave after an hour but kept sticking with it. The acting is fine, but this movie falls flat on keeping the audience engaged and interested. We spent the whole movie looking at each other and hoping it would end. Definitely don't recommend seeing this. Love Johnny Depp like most of you, but take my advice and watch this when you don't run the risk of waisting $15 and two hours of your time. The movie spans 30 years of crime under Whitey Bulger and jumps from hit to hit and scene to scene leaving the viewer questioning why it matters to continue to watch the movie. The primary point of drama is whether is Bulger's relationship with his friend Cooper will unravel and leave them both out to dry; but the viewer quickly loses interests when it becomes evident that the move has nothing special to it. I am very disappointed I spent money to see this.A hot blooded gangster film about a cold blooded bastard. Black Mass tells the story of the infamous alliance between the Boston FBI and the city's bastard son, James "Whitey" Bulger. In telling a story that has stained Boston and the FBI for all of eternity and telling with precision, guts and, most of all, honesty, it solidifies Black Mass as one of the best films of the year thus far. Starring an unrecognizable Johnny Depp and a scene stealing Joel Edgerton, the film blasts off on screen, making you want more and more as it play out. Just like in typical gangster fashion, there are long speeches, there is brutal violence and there is not one moment where it ever lets up. While the film itself doesn't break any new ground regarding gangster films, it is still a more than welcomed addition to the lot of them and may even become iconic but it is a bit too early to tell. Johnny Depp is absolutely fantastic as Bulger. Depp brings a level of performance to the table that we haven't seen in years. He can be charming, cunning, ruthless and, at times, so cold blooded you question if this man has any humanity. For an actor to be able to pull off this kind of role, it takes a specific mind set and Johnny Depp nails it. Between scenes of him murdering anyone who threatens his empire, we see Bulger, the family man. The man that would kill for nothing being brought to his knees as he is told his son has died. There is humanity in Depp's performance as Bulger, there's just so many layers to peel back in order to get to it. I can't rave about Depp enough. The man is mind blowingly fantastic in this film and no words I can put down can justify the level of perfection he brings to this film. Joel Edgerton plays John Connolly, who ends up stealing the show in many scenes. Edgerton has become a force to be reckoned with and a pool of untapped talent that has finally been able to roar to the surface with August's The Gift (for which he wrote, directed and starred) and now with Black Mass. I sense an Oscar nomination for his work in Black Mass. He is THAT good. To be able to act opposite of Depp's career best performance and hold your own, that is saying something in and of itself. Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemons, Julianne Nicholson, Rory Cochrane and everyone else in this cast is pitch perfect. Even Dakota Johnson is good but then again, my expectations for her was that it was going to be hard to take her seriously but she ended up delivering a fantastic performance as Lyndsay Cyr. Scott Cooper has directed some pretty fantastic films, Crazy Heart and Out of the Furnace. But Black Mass is his masterpiece thus far. Cooper created a film drenched in the styles of the 70s cinema. It acts a love letter to films like The Godfather, The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Mean Streets and even Serpico. Cooper's direction skyrockets what could have easily been a bomb into something very organic and very special. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic in this film, covering Boston never like a character but as a playground for Whitey. It is engrossing and engaging throughout and never overwhelming like Cooper's Out of the Furnace cinematography was. Every component to this film screams for perfection and with a director like Scott Cooper and a cast headed by an Oscar worthy Johnny Depp, the film gets just that...perfection.Not bad, just so damn standard. The American crime genre is arguably the cornerstone of modern cinema. Think cinematic masterpieces and there's a good chance every third one is a mobster flick or underworld yarn. This breed of film is nothing if not reliable. Why, then, is the first notable movie about one of U.S.A's most notorious and durable heads of crime so unmemorable? Checking off key points in an organised but uninspired manner, this James "Whitey" Bulger biopic is seemingly more concerned about fitting in all the Wiki-worthy moments rather than truly delving into the psyche of a monstrous man. The unfocused script stems from the choice to trace two decades of Bulger's life (1975 to 1995), an unwieldy stretch of time that results in an unclear filmic timeline and the requirement for truly horrible makeup and wigs. Johnny Depp has succeeded at portraying a gangster before ‚Äì his John Dillinger in Public Enemies is enthralling ‚Äì however he's lumped with too many poorly executed physical alterations and character development shortcomings to make an impression here. Aussie Joel Edgerton fares better as a morally intriguing federal agent skating on thin ice, and Kevin Bacon is enjoyable as a frustrated FBI boss, but why Benedict Cumberbatch signed on for such an inconsequential role, as Bulger's Senator brother, is anyone's guess. Scott Cooper keeps it relatively low-key behind the camera, aside from a couple of stylish murder sequences, with the suitably dour cinematography and unfussy score following suit. Overall Black Mass is never overtly bad, per se; its major sin is just being so damn standard.Awful, Horrible, extremely boring, abysmally pathetic Poor acting. Extremely slow moving story. Do Not watch this movie. Its barely watchable in bits but largely uncoordinated with no consistent narrative and characters. The director needs to learn to do some editing and script writing. No body in their right mind would have approved this movie to go into production.  I've heard some critics discuss the overuse of violence in the film. Though there is quite a bit of violence, I thought it was used very tastefully. No blood was used where it didn't seem necessary, and personally, I think that the violence becomes numbing, which takes us even further into the mob guys' mentality on murder.  All the positive-rated reviews are by Johny depp fan boys and not good cinema critiques. Avoid watching it if you can, at all costs. A sheer waste of 2 hours! The ending is predictable within the first 5 minutes of the movie. Go re-watch the usual suspects instead."This is to gangster films what Fury is to war films" -a friend Even without taking into account the misleading advertising, this is still a complete disaster of a film. The writing is sloppy at best, the editing is downright horrific, the score is so bland that it seems to be dead set on ruining any chance that any scene has of showing any quality, and even the acting is frequently cringe-worthy. This is a film so overtly disorganized and lacking of vision that by watching it you get the feeling that it actually wants you to give up and watch something else. The main attraction is Depp's performance, but for the entire second half of the film, he takes a screen time backseat to appease the very poorly cast Joel Edgerton, who despite being a fine actor in his own right, could not possibly do any good with a character that the audience could have witnessed in a small role in a single scene, and know just as much about as they do by the end of the movie. In fact, the same could be said for nearly every character. I learned nothing about Whitey Bulger that I didn't gather from the trailer for this movie. Characters and plot lines come and go with no indication of significance because the film's main thematic focus appears to be the idea of using a bad guy to get other bad guys, and the ethical dilemmas that might surround such an agreement. The way it decides to convey this theme would be by having a scene where Joel Edgerton says that he needs Johnny Depp, and then one or more of his colleagues (or wife) either silently or loudly question his enthusiasm for the informant while new information is received to further enforce the illusion that there is anything here to actually invest in. Now repeat that scene about twenty or thirty times and you have the bulk of the movie, then throw some violent scenes in between with little to no context or reason to care and you have the rest, that is the rest that you will still be able to vaguely remember less than thirty minutes after finishing it. But a script never makes or breaks a film; that responsibility lies in the editing. And my god, does this film have really, really bad editing. There is never any sense that the movie has an idea of what is going through the audience's head as they traverse through scene after scene of insultingly forced use of music (which is cookie-cutter enough already without taking center stage) and dreadful cutting. Things don't get prettier when looking at the pacing of the film from a broader perspective...it should not be clear WITHOUT researching a film that it can't decide who the protagonist should be (or if there should be one at all) or how much focus should be given to ANY character or ANY event. I'm not sure what went wrong because there's a lot of talent involved in this in both the cast and crew, but the final product here is a dull mess of a motion picture whose only redeeming qualities (a few entertaining moments and standout performances from Depp and Sarsgaard) are so outweighed by its flaws that it's really not even worth a glance.Even Johnny Depp Couldn't Save this Movie Maybe it's because I lived in Jersey for thirty years and got use to the dialects or reading about the mob in the newspaper over a cup of coffee at Dunkin Donuts. But to me Black Mass was about as exciting as watching a bad night of karaoke when you've promised yourself you weren't going to drink or smoke anymore. Truth be told, I didn't even recognize Johnny Depp - that's how great an actor he is, but sometimes even a great actor can't save a movie from oblivion. Of course, I realize critics love this type of movie for all the logical reasons they learned in film school, but really, if I hadn't been invited to see it with a friend I would have walked out halfway through. Like I said in the opening, maybe it's just me or maybe the king really isn't wearing any clothes ;-)This is a "plan B" movie, far from what the critics and the press are saying about it I really don't know where to start, commenting about this movie. Perhaps I've setup my expectations to high due such a huge marketing media promoting the debut of this movie. The only thing I know is that I left the movie theater with a sour taste in my mouth.  I am far from being a movie critic, but I have seen enough good movies from Mr.Depp to know that this one is not his "opera prima" like some movie critics have already said. The script is sometimes boring, and I wonder what Francis Coppola and a more recent director Martin Scorssese would think about this movie after seeing such a fiasco at trying to characterize the mafia day in the 70 in the American society. Again, I am sorry but I don't see Mr.Depp characterization being as good as the press claims.  If you have a plan B, pick it, this is not a plan A movieOne of Johnny Depp's Best/Most Grounded Performances BLACK MASS is a valuable reminder that Johnny Depp doesn't need a zany costume and wacky mannerisms to perform. I suppose the last time I saw him in a more grounded role was probably THE RUM DIARY from 2011, and that was none too memorable. His performance as Boston mobster James "Whitey" Bulger is his best in many years. BLACK MASS tells the story of how FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) returned to Boston and convinced his superiors that an alliance with south Boston criminal Bulger would be vital in stamping out Italian mob activities in the area. Bulger begins acting as an informant to the FBI, providing useful information to flush out his competition while building his own criminal empire. Meanwhile, Connolly and his co-conspirator John Morris (David Harbour) work within the FBI to hide evidence of Bulger's activities, allowing him to thrive and providing the them a cushier life than is normally afforded government agents. BLACK MASS chronicles James Bulger's rise to power, the violence and murder that defined his reign as one of America's most dangerous criminals, and his eventual downfall when the FBI began to crack down on their internal corruption, sending Bulger on the run. BLACK MASS is a movie that won't leave you feeling too well, as there's hardly an honorable character in the mix and just about everyone is a villain, but it's engrossing in it's depiction of government corruption left to run wild and the shady individuals it allows to thrive. When I first saw BLACK MASS, I found myself frustratingly distracted by two things: Depp's makeup as Bulger and Benedict Cumberbatch's Boston accent. Once you get accustomed to those, this movie is pretty cool. It's adapted from the book of the same name, written by the Boston Globe reporters who broke the story in 1997 about Bulger's association with the FBI. It's a dour portrait of one of America's most infamous gangsters, a man who spent more than a decade on the FBI's Most Wanted list. If Depp's performance is anything to go by, the man was not one to be messed with. With his thinning hair, piercing blue eyes, and predatory nature, Bulger struck fear into anyone unfortunate to have had dealings with him. He's a cold, calculating man with a free ticket for violence and murder to establish his empire thanks to the blind eye turned his way. Johnny Depp, who seems at first a weird choice for the role, knocks it out of the park as Bulger. He plays the man like a shark, calm and collected until he smells blood in the water. Then he snaps and you'd just better hope you're not on the receiving end. Depp's Bulger is the focal point of BLACK MASS so the movie really lives or dies based on his performance, and it's easy to forget the man under that hairpiece and contact lenses is the same man famous for eccentric performances like Jack Sparrow or the creepy Willy Wonka. Depp is supported with a fantastic cast including Edgerton, Harbour, Kevin Bacon, Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Sarsgaard, Jesse Plemons and more. The movie is loaded with serious talent, bringing this story to life. Most of them are nothing more than background dressing, be it Bacon's role as Connolly's FBI superior or Cumberbatch's role as Bulger's brother/Massachusetts senator Billy. Neither does more than serve their limited role in the overall story, but it's great that even the smaller roles were handled with care. The city of Boston is just as much a character in the scope of this movie. Bulger was first and foremost a "Southie", a man of Irish heritage born and raised in south Boston. The community played a major role in Bulger's life. People knew him and were loyal to him. The movie makes a point to show Bulger's love for his hometown in a moment when he crosses paths with a little old woman from his past and insists on helping her get her groceries home. BLACK MASS tries to pin a human side to the seemingly inhuman gangster with some background into the death of his young (adopted?) son but any humanity he might have seems to fade when the chains are off and Bulger is given the chance to rule Boston's underworld. BLACK MASS is definitely a "feel-bad" movie but it's a good one. It'll blow your mind what the man was able to get away with but at least the movie closes on a positive note with the reminder that Bulger was eventually brought to justice to serve the rest of his life in prison.Johnny Depp is back acting James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp) is a small time Irish mobster in Southie Boston. FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), from the neighborhood, recruits Whitey to be an informant through his political brother Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch). Connolly and his boss Agent Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon) are trying to bring down the Italian mob in Boston. The loyalty of Connolly is in doubt as McGuire demands more from Whitey who starts to become a powerful gangster. Johnny Depp regains his acting cred. The story is told in a straight forward manner. It's a bit too straight. Connolly is the missing emotional drama element. Edgerton is fine but his character could have been even more epic. In many ways, his character is the mystery and the possible main character study. It's his character that changes throughout the story. It's his character that provides a possible arc. The reveal of his manufacturing of Whitey's information is a dramatic highlight. The question of why is touched on but it could be a whole movie by itself. Connolly would make for a superior main character. That's not saying that the acting from both is anything but top rate.outstanding!!! just finished watching black mass and WOW JOHNNY DEPP up and does it again, absolutely brilliant he is. I read one review just now,  this is a true story so why would anyone want to throw in things just to make it more than it is. If you like Goodfellas, Casino, Donnie Brasco etc, this isn't either this is black mass. personally i friggin loved it.  THE ACTING IS SUPERB through and through. definitive Oscar material to Depp and the whole make up team.  But pleas don't do the whole comparing thing. true stories are true, fiction is fiction.Turgid The movie is about James "Whitey" Bulger, the notorious Boston mob leader. It ought to be better than it is. The style and subject matter are chiefly from Martin Scorsese, just as the musical score borrows heavily from John Powell's score for "The Bourne Identity." There are several of Scorsese's familiar overhead shots of table tops, amusing scenes of Bulger playing gin rummy with his mother, and so forth. I'll have to guess at why it doesn't entirely clear the bar. It's certainly not the subject matter, which has been a popular movie subject since the beginning of the talkies in the early 30s. Oh, we LOVE gangsters. The casting is flawed, for one thing. Johnny Depp looks rather like Bulger but he's so inexpressive that there's hardly any way of knowing what the character is feeling, especially since he lies so often. He wears the same expression whether he's kissing his son good-night or shooting a traitor in the back of the head. Dakota Johnson looks sweet beyond comparison but it remains to be seen whether she has chops. The figure who is almost as central to the story as Bulger himself is Joel Edgerton, and he's not very convincing as an FBI agent. It's unpleasant to watch his character and listen to him. The whole movie is unpleasant. The opening shot is a close up of a battered, ugly, snotty, pitted face -- poor Jesse Plemons. Since this is "based on a true story," we expect the narrative to be messy. That's life, right? But this story is sometimes hard to follow because the continuity is weak. Not by design, I don't think, as it was in Stanley Kubrick's work, but because the script was faulty. What the movie DOES deliver on is gore. People are battered to death, blood splashing all over the place. People are constantly being shot, sometimes for reasons that are obscure. And they're almost all head shots, except for somebody like Peter Sarsgaard who gets riddled with bullets and dies shrieking with pain, rolling around in a parking lot. (Cf., Joe Pesci beaten to death with baseball bats in Scorsese's "Casino.") The FBI is involved in all this, one way or another, but they're hardly sympathetic figures. The reliable Kevin Bacon emerges with his dignity intact as does Sarsgaard. It's curious to see Benedict Cumberbatch in an American movie. He's a fine actor, though his accent sounds generically urban rather than Bostonian. Nice location shooting, by the way. It's not a bad film, not insulting, but it is sluggish and a little dull, uninspired except for the murder scenes.The mostly true story of the rise and fall of South Boston gangster Whitey Bulger. I was able to watch this at home on DVD from my public library. My wife chose to NOT see it, she doesn't care for this type of movie. First the title, I was able to find this online, "Black Mass" is a phrase, which essentially represents "a perversion of the Catholic mass,'' is a metaphor for the FBI's corruption, with Bulger as the devil. "It plays in the idea of an unholy alliance.''  Johnny Depp received a Best Actor nomination for his role as Bulger, complete with prosthetic makeup which, according to those who knew Bulger in the 1970s and 1980s, was eerily reminiscent of Bulger himself. The look, along with Depp's acting, was genuinely menacing to some of the cast members, according to the 12-minute feature on the DVD extras. Is it a good movie? Well yes if you believe that it is primarily factual. As we see in the movie Bulger leaves Boston and travels the world under assumed names until captured some years later and he is now in prison for the rest of his life. He disputes the content of the source book, as do several other key characters. Depp requested, through his lawyer, a face-to-face with Bulger, but was denied, reportedly because Bulger was not happy with the story being presented. The movie has lots of bloody violence and foul language throughout, as might be expected of ruthless mobsters. I choose to believe most of it is factual and as such is a fascinating look inside organized crime, informants, and FBI connections.Entertaining with great performances! 6/10 Review: I quite enjoyed this film because I did find Johnny Depp's character, James "Whitey" Bulger, quite intriguing and there is a sense of intensity throughout the movie, but it wasn't in the same league as Goodfellas. Johnny Depp played the leading role quite well and his brother, Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) was a weird choice but he still put in a good performance but it did seem like Whitey bullied his way into the underworld, more than using an intelligent mind to get to the top. Don't get me wrong, he did fool the FBI by giving them old information, so they could get away with there brutal and vicious behaviour but they done a lot of there murders in broad daylight and none of Whitey's team were that loyal. After the death of Whitey's son, he seemed to go a bit of the rails and he was killing random people for any reason. His close friend, John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), who worked for the FBI, was literally letting Whitey get away with murder and I honestly can't believe that he never thought that he would get caught. What also amazed me, was that everyone became a "rat" towards the end and no one seemed to try and hold back any information. Anyway, the make-up department really did give there all, by totally transforming Johnny Depp into a 70's thug. Some of the scenes are very brutal so it's not a movie for the squeamish but there is a lot of political footage, which I found uninteresting. The fact that Whitey was on the run for 16 years whilst being on the FBI's Most Wanted list, is truly amazing and with so many people turning against him, he will be living the rest of his life behind bars as a lonely man. His close brother Billy was an inspiring senator who everyone looked up to but when the FBI found out that he had been in contact with his brother, he sadly lost everything that he had worked hard for. All of his fellow criminals also had to pay the price for Whitey's action, by getting hefty jail sentences, so the question remains, was it really worth it! I suppose the buzz of having loads of power and money can get to your head but when your living on the edge, especially when you don't know when Whitey is going to turn on you, I'm not surprised that they all took the easy way out by confessing to there crimes. Anyway, it's definitely a watchable movie which I found quite interesting but I have seen better films in this genre. Enjoyable! Round-Up: For Johnny Depp's preparation for this movie, he asked Whitey's lawyer if he could have access to the man himself but he didn't want any connection to the book, which is the basis of this film, so I'm just wondering, how much of it is true. The director, Scott Cooper, did have access to some of Whitey's fellow work mates, who actually showed up on set and the movie was made in Boston, we're a lot of the real events took place, so that will explain the realism that is felt through the film. Anyway, Scott Cooper has only directed 3 movies in his career, including this one, and I must admit, they have been pretty impressive. He first hit the scene in 2009 with the Academy award winning Crazy Heart and he also made Out of the Furnace which starred Christian Bale and Casey Affleck. After playing the leading role in Donnie Brasco and playing John Dillinger in Public Enemies, I'm not surprised that Scott picked Depp for the leading role and you can tell that he was fully committed to the movie but it still felt like there was something missing. It is put together well and the various characters were great but I was left feeling that it could have been better. Budget: $53million Worldwide Gross: $100million I recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/crime/drama movies starring Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgaard, Adam Scott, David Harbour, Corey Stoll, Juno Temple and Julianne Nicholson. 6/10Makes you love films again. I would love to sit the makers of all the god awful films I have endured in the last few years, the film I got up and stormed out to find myself in the rain in my garden in the rain and thinking I would rather stand in the cold rain than watch the rest of the film. This film has everything these films miss, beautiful photography, great acting, good pace, excellent script. This is a true story of one of South Boston's most wanted criminal, this is a version of events, some question whether it is entirely factual, it really does not matter, treat yourself enjoy this wonderful film, Johhny Depp is brilliant, he does not go overboard but the menace is bubbling away.No Insight About the Story &amp; Adds Nothing to the Gangster Genre This is a Matter of Fact, sometimes very Intense Bio-Pic of the Infamous Criminal, don't call me "Whitey" Bulger. Left to "Run Amok" in His Southie Neighborhood of Boston, because He allegedly is supplying "Information" about His Rival Italian Gang. Ever since "Whitey" was finally Caught after 12 Years on the Lam, there have been No Shortage of Stories, Documentaries, and Dramas about His "Collaboration" with the FBI and His Brutal Gang Activities on the Streets of His Home Town. Anyone Aware of the Story will find this Rendition a Repeat of the Already Familiar. The Movie does Nothing to make it seem Fresh or Wanting. Aside from Johnny Depp's calculating and Effective Performance, and a full Cast of A-List Stars and Familiar Faces who all Perform Adequately, there just isn't enough Insight here to make this a Must See. As a Real-Life Gangster Film it is OK, but Certainly Nothing to attract Attention and most Definitely has Nothing New to Add to the Genre. It goes for a Flat Look and Stylization is Nowhere to be seen. It even has some Dull and rather Routine Scenes that make for a somewhat Facile Film. Those Unfamiliar with the Facts and anyone who has not seen a lot of Gangster Movies might find it Dramatic with Spurts of Street Violence with Characters that stare with Blank Eyes and Black Souls, with Perverse Loyalty and Attachments that Fade Quickly when the "Chips Are Down".  The Film is a Nonstop Parade of Unlikable Characters on Both Sides of the Law and its a rather Depressing Dramatization of Despicable People. There are a couple of Futile Scenes Sprinkled in that tries to Humanize these Thugs and Cops, but the Good Cast is ultimately left with Shallow and Uninteresting Ugliness. Note...The Documentary..."Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger" (2014)...is an excellent Film.It is Johnny Depp go see it! I have to add 10 stars because the lead role was well played by a man of mysterious as the tides of the Caribean. This is based on the true story and like any true story it is boring and long winded, Whos life have you ever listen to that is more interesting? I never met a person that had a movie quality life, it is all Hollywood and they did a great job with this one. rent it and buy it if you're a gangster aficionado. The movie starts off with a good story line and starts to roll uphill into the American dream for anyone bold enough to grab on to it. You can say that the business gave him the strength and just like politics it kept getting bigger and bigger where there where loyalist helping him to become the one crime family that they can control. It is crazy that this man was never murdered in jail for working with the feds.Good Performances but Ho-Hum, and a bit disappointing (spoilers) I was expecting a bit more from director Scott Cooper's "Black Mass". It is repetitive in a poor way - featuring murder scene, dialog/exposition, repeat again and again. It hides under real events rather than illuminating them. Acting is satisfactory, but by the end of the movie it didn't matter. The movie was a mild bore. Moreover Johnny Depp's performance is decent, but overrated, and the screenplay is unoriginal - this is no "Goodfellas". There is little surprising, interesting, or fresh; and the movie just ends on an epilogue note. The production design, sets, and editing were pretty good but the violence was gratuitous and also repetitive - so altogther a little disappointing, but maybe worth one watch. 6/10not a handsome leading man Scott Cooper has me on the outside looking in. I can't seem to get close to the main character, Whitey Bulger. Upon reflection, the director presents a main character whose look is hard to accept. Most everyone else in the film looks normal, but the Bulger character is almost like... maybe Benjamin Button-maybe not that overstated. But after I slept on it I am convinced that this choice holds the film back. A different choice would have been to let Depp just play the part virtually looking like he does in real life. That's the other extreme anyway. As it stands I have trouble approaching this Bulger, so I remain at a distance, watching but never am I inside, immersed. The film as it is leaves a lot of potential untapped.Gets under your skin Over his impressively long career, Johnny Depp has adorned make-up and a variety of wigs, contact lenses and outlandish costumes to deliver a plethora of memorable (and not-so-memorable) characters, performed with a trademark flamboyance now simpatico with the actor. The success of these films, which are often seen through the Gothic lens of Tim Burton, makes it easy to forget that there is a good- looking actor capable of a fantastic 'normal' performance in there somewhere. Black Mass shows a bit of both sides. He has once again donned a rather distracting appearance - a set of pale blue eyes, a receding hairline and bulbous nose - to portray James "Whitey" Bulger, but there is also a terrific and unseen intensity to Depp here, convincingly scaring the s**t out of anyone he comes across. Clearly channelling Scorsese visually, director Scott Cooper of Crazy Heart (2009) and Out of the Furnace (2013) fame skips his main character's rise to criminal overlord in favour of showing us just how much of a b*****d Bulger was (and probably still is). His otherworldly appearance, with blotchy skin and a mouth full of wonky brown teeth, is not how the real man looked but instead serves to highlight his monstrous nature. Bulger's activities are recollected by his former gang members Stephen Flemmi (Rory Cochrane), Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons) and John Martorano (W. Earl Brown), who all have their own bone to pick with him by the end of their story. His willingness to murder and threaten whether it be for business, pleasure, or to simply stay out of jail led to Bulger becoming one of the most notorious criminals in Boston history. In the beginning, Bulger is approached by FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), a local boy, who offers him a free ticket to the top of the criminal underworld. It's not snitching, but a deal that benefits both sides as Connolly is served rival gang members on a plate, and Bulger gets to carry on with his illegal activities without the prying eyes of federal agents. Only Connolly seems to be enjoying peeking into the criminal high life a bit too much while Bulger gives him diddly squat. Bulger plays him like a fiddle, managing to silence a dinner table with murderous threats thinly disguised as jest in one stand-out scene. And Black Mass is at its best when the film moves into darker territory, cruelly teasing the inevitable brutality to come whenever a disposable minor character shuffles onto the scene. Narratively, it's all over the place and tends to neglect detail in favour of more conventional biopic storytelling. In the few scenes he has, Benedict Cumberbatch oozes a subtle sliminess as Whitey's Massachusetts State Senate President brother Billy. The vastly different paths these two brothers took could have made for engaging drama and given the film more balance, but strangely Cooper chooses to almost ignore the relationship completely to concentrate on Bulger's dealing with the FBI, so Cumberbatch is criminally under- served. However, as silly as he looks, Depp is genuinely unsettling and, like the film as a whole, gets under your skin. Black Mass sounds like it should be a horror, and as the creepy real-life security footage plays out over the credits, its hard to deny that in many way it is.No coherence..poorly told story with loose connections Directors too often focus on individual scenes trying to milk their actors nowadays. This often leads to movies with seemingly no cohesion. Whether it's a style or something they think resonates with a certain crowd is hard to say. What is easy to remark is that this is a movie that has many pieces without a string. You're left with a yearning for a 'mov'ie but presented with something akin to stills.  Sure it has one or two moments, but with such an excellent ensemble, you expect good things from the movie and it just fails.  It could have been a great crime drama..look at departed or Donnie Brasco. It never really gets going and is quite boringToo Much Like A 60-Minutes Story With A Big Budget After watching Black Mass one has a detached feeling. A feature length film about a real criminal who had a long reign of running a criminal enterprise should seek to invest the viewer into the events as well as the man, Black Mass seems more like a glimpse that never reels one in to the time, the crime, and, most importantly never exposes much about the central figures. You really do not know more than, say, what a 15-minute 60 Minutes expose would reveal. The frustration begins with the use of Johnny Depp's James "Whitey" Bulger character. Depp does an excellent job of creating the image of Bulger, but somewhere the writers seem to gloss over what his reign of crime in Boston was actually costing in depravity and murder. It was a truly bizarre reign with a psychopathic Bulger controlling everything the FBI was pinning on the Mafia. How did a government agency with the power to clean up both The Mafia and Bulger get so used? Whatever was going on was somehow made possible by one John Connolly who for unknown reasons, other than what we're told is Southie loyalty, constructed a false story of Bulger being a high-value informant. One can only deduce Connally was, in reality, also a member of The Winter Hill Gang who idolized Bulger and ruined his life to "impress" the man. Joel Edgerton, like Depp, delivers shades of brilliance as Connolly only to be let down by what the writers glossed over. I simply think as viewers we aren't allowed to know these men in any revelatory way. Jesse Plemons portrayal, with limited screen time, as Bulger's lackey Kevin Weeks is far more revealing. We actually feel who he is a rough street kid without anything other than his devotion to Bulger. The same can be said for W. Earl Brown's dumb murdering thug Martorano and David Harbour's FBI agent John Morris as the we know better what kind of men these were even without lengthy development. It makes the omission of what and who Bulger and Connolly were all the more frustrating. So, if you want to see Depp really bring Bulger to the full light of day you simply won't get that. One feels Depp had the goods, and was in the mindset, to do so, but the writers failed to use him properly. This was just a recreation of an extremely topical overview with A-list talent instead. For those with an avid interest it may still, however, be worth a watch, for others not so much.Amazing. It was amazing. I believe it had many memorable scenes including scenes without dialogue. The sheer cinematography and way it's presented makes it a memorable experience filled with unforgettable performances. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, with my eyes wide open and my jaw dropped. It felt like I was watching something god-like. It was like I was taken to another world. This movie made me appreciate cinema again and awoke my love for the art. Like I was a kid again quoting movies in daily conversation and making homemade epics on my sister's digital camera. It sparked that kind of love again. Maybe it's 'cause I was high, but I loved it.It's Been Done Before And Much Better In A Fictional Backdrop A FBI man gets his hands on a notorious , untouchable crime boss in Boston . He makes a deal with the crime boss - if he turns state evidence against his underlings and rivals he'll be granted immunity from prosecution . Better still the crime boss can carry on with his life of crime and very soon it seems the FBI agent is working for the crime boss  Hold on haven't we seen this plot before ? Yes we have a few years ago when Martin Scorsese made THE DEPARTED a film heavily influenced by the real life activities of Whitey Bulger and his posse of violent thugs The Winter Hill Gang . BLACK MASS tells the true story of Bulger and his gang but quite often fiction is better than truth , either that or this story hasn't been told well in a cinematic way . Director Scott Cooper isn't Martin Scorsese and the way the on screen story is drawn up is rather uninvolving  Johnny Depp has won some critical acclaim as Bulger but let's be honest here and say that Johnny Depp has built up a reputation playing quirky characters in films that aren't usually pitched to mainstream audiences . Here he's cast against type in a relatively commercial studio picture . As it stands Depp might pick up an Oscar nomination but the prize will probably go to that other talented pretty boy Leonardo DiCaprio for THE REVENANTGood as i expected it to be... Black Mass was good as i thought it was going to be Johnny Depp gives an amazing performance and i think the whole cast did a good job but he is the only one that truly shines. I think the reason why the reviews for this film from some people were only a 7 or a 6 is because they expected something between the Departed and Goodfellas and other films like that. The reason why some movies turn into Classics is because they are directed perfectly and because they are getting made just one time i definitely put Black Mass into my list with the best Gangster/Crime films of all time if you were disappointed so far with everything Depp is doing prepare for his come back because he is Back.Great Flick: About as true as it gets, which makes it boring at times... I grew up around this life, first in Queens and later when I moved to Southie to reconnect with the guys that I served with in the Marines. This is about as true as it gets. It misses the dramatic thrill of 'The Departed." It does not have the compelling power struggle of "The Godfather" movies. It is sort of a poor-man's Goodfellas in that the criminals are typical Irish gangsters of their era. They do not wear suits and get all dolled up. They kill, steal, and scheme - in jeans and bad jackets - that is what they do. In this regard, if you are looking for a movie that will end with some extraordinary dramatic flourish, you will be disappointed. The Godfather or the Sopranos are not the real life of these guys or most mobsters - Irish, Italian, or otherwise. The movie sucks you into the day-to-day existence of a guy who many questioned as to whether or not he was more psychopath than sociopath, and it makes you decide which was he. The one issue I have is that it allows other guys to walk away cleanly. Steve Flemmi is especially given a pass, when everyone knows he was a mass murderer and rapist of women. In the movie they make Flemmi out to be a sympathetic figure (probably because he was hired as a consultant). But in the end, you get a real picture of Whitey. He never really had to kill a lot of folks to get ahead because of the Irish Gang wars of the 1960s and 70s left him as the last man standing. Since the Italian mafia was the Federal focus of the time, he gets the deal he wants from the FBI and the local PD - especially in an Irish Boston that hated anyone with a vowel on the wrong side of his name. He sort of plods his way into power and once he is there, he holds it through pure and justifiable fear. In the end, you see what really happens - no drama... Whitey just committed crimes as easily as he breathed. It was natural for him. That is what makes this movie awesome. Johnny Depp really captures the essence of a guy that just kills people - sometimes for no real purpose. If you like the history of Organized Crime, you will love this movie. If you are looking for a two hour shoot 'em out, you will not. If you like your gangsters in suits and ties, you will hate it. If you like your mobsters in their real element, you will love it. I loved it.Good film but Johnny Depp's make up artist should be fired If you are into gangster movies like 'GoodFellas' or 'Casino' then you'll love this film. However this film is dedicated to telling the true story of the Irish-American mafia - not so much the Italians. Johnny's acting is superb. The story line connecting Bulgers life events, connections to the IRA and all his extortion and money laundering rackets has been clearly depicted throughout the film. The story is easy to follow and the violence scenes are very entertaining. Most of the actors were faultless throughout the film and can't be criticised.  Only issue I had was the obsession by the make-up artist to make Johnny look so much like Bulger with the receding hairline, that they made him look unnatural. Also why was he so pale? Also why did some of the villains have such dirty greasy faces? Bulger was made to look more like The Bogeyman than a natural Boston city villain. You couldn't look at him straight in the face and take him seriously. If Johnny's acting and the story-line wasn't so good, it had the potential to ruin the whole film. Still I saw past the ridiculous make-up and really enjoyed the film. I learnt something new about history of crime in Boston too.Something was missing.... I can't argue with the fact that Black Mass achieved commercial success. It also managed to transform you into the time and place of the setting and wrap you around the prevailing mood. It was good direction in my opinion. The director achieved what he could achieve with the tools he had. My criticism comes in two broad veins: (1) casting/appearance and (2) script. Jonny Depp is an excellent actor but the prosthetics used on his face made him look like Jonny Depp but not like Jonny Depp at the same time. And I couldn't help but get distracted by it perpetually. Those blue contact lenses were the worst offender. I was waiting for the point where this piercing "blueness" was weaved into the story and the character of Whitey somehow - and whilst subtly this was achieved - it wasn't enough to take away from the distraction. In addition why on earth was Benedict Cumberbatch in this film? He looked woefully out of place. He didn't look like his family in anyway and his role appeared to be to just remind everyone Whitey had a brother who was a politician. Alternatively it was just a name to add to the credits and posters. An unknown would have been perfect for this. The "pulling power" of stars like Cumberbatch has its place in cinema (rightly or wrongly) but this was a film about Whitey and the focus should have been on his story. These two issues served to stir you back into reality every now and again and the story (which I'll come to) lost its grasp on you. The story. I mean it is what it is right? Whitey was a gangster, loved by most of his community, made a pact with the FBI, fell out of favour with the FBI, went on the run, got caught. There's not much variation to work with; but the film was crying out for a big scene or a middle or an end. There were none. In fact I was so surprised that the end of the film arrived that I double checked that people were leaving. It was almost as if production went sh*t - lets end here. There was nothing about his life on the run; nothing about the fates of the major characters (other than the text on screen); the film demanded that. We got no "fall from grace" and hardship. Instead we got high life, trouble with the law, the end. That said, Jonny Depp's performance (prosthetics aside) was fantastic though I wouldn't rank this alongside The Departed, Goodfellas, Godfather etc...Perfect 'biopic'? Or teeming with sub-genre pastiches and a protracted plot line? ‚Äì I'll let you decide. The classy yet ultra violent gangster biopic, which has become something of a cult classic of late, is fortunate enough to make yet another appearance with the release of Scott Cooper's Black Mass. As an aficionado of the sub-genre, I eagerly anticipated a familiar assemblage of voice-overs, a dynamic non-linear narrative and a reproachable yet oddly admirable focaliser who, come the denouement, is stripped of his political clout and sent to prison to answer for his crimes. Suffice to say I was not disappointed by what I saw. Despite getting a little lost among its midriff, as does so often happen when filming an episodic multi-decade flick, Black Mass holds up as both a confident and dynamic feature with an interesting political backdrop in Bulger's IRA relations. Following his 2013 thriller; Out of the Furnace, Cooper brings us yet another all-star cast in which Johnny Depp's sterling performance steals the show. Depp's stylish yet chilling rendition of James Bulger marks his return to the big screen after what has arguably been a series of clunkers, the likes of which include Mortdecai and Transcendence. Moreover, Depp's take on Boston's unlawful kingpin 'Whitey' Bulger heralds his reappearance in the biopic style and in a role of some familiarity; playing the charismatic John Dillinger in Public Enemy and Joseph D. Pistone or 'Donnie' (his alias) in Donnie Brasco. For my part, Black Mass seems to be a picture inspired by the Neo-Noirs of the early 1980's. Whether or not I would classify Black Mass as a Neo-Noir, or even a Neo Neo-Noir I am ambivalent, however Scott Cooper's own taste for the stylish Hollywood crime dramas of the time, such as John Huston's Neo-Noir Fat City, have certainly rubbed off on his own film making ideology. The conflicted antihero (Cooper), the striking use of light and shadow, and the low-key lighting are all elements playing homage to the style. Yet Cooper's steady cinematography make it difficult to deem the film a definite Neo-Noir, as some of the distinctive visual elements attributed to the style rely upon unusual camera placement and movement. Rather it makes the film seem a bit more like a documentary; much to the distaste of some viewers. It can be said that Cooper presents us a sense of verisimilitude worthy of a 'biopic', yet wrapped in a Neo-Noir like shell, reflective of his own work as a director and an appreciator of film. Although arguably it is too early in his filmmaking career to tell, Scott Cooper seems to be becoming an auteur, whose work and influences reflect real life themes and events. Both Black Mass and Crazy heart, his 2009 musical drama in which he produced, wrote and directed, are testament to this dogma. The sense of gravitas ascribed to Black Mass in presenting a more biographic interpretation of South Boston's unholy alliance, is oddly unique and charming. Black Mass exposes us to the cracks that could so easily infiltrate Federal Law Enforcement agencies in the United States during the late 1900's. Personally, I have not seen a film with a better take on the dark side of American community values since Sidney Lumet's Serpico, in which all but one cop in the New York Police Department succumb to the temptations of the job and are twisted by the system's corruption. I remark the charm of Cooper's work because it has become something of a platitude recently to retrofit the 'gangster biopic' with excessive hyperrealism and the natural propensities of its directors. Whilst this can be a good thing, providing an entertaining experience for the viewer, it can sometimes take the 'bio' out of the 'biopic'. Cooper's Black Mass stays true to the sub-genre's codes and in some ways is an example of a perfect 'biopic', with a neat and intriguing blend of classic gangster movie drama and an intimate Bulger biographical experience. Nevertheless, Cooper's depiction of South Boston's crime syndicate is not completely beyond reproach, and for some moviegoers you can be sure that the slow-moving theatrical cut (which is roughly 45 minutes shorter than Cooper's director's cut) will be subject to audience appraisal, critiqued for being a little too realistic a portrait of Bulger's criminal empire. Several other reviews have been quick to denounce Cooper's Black Mass as not only protracted, but largely an imitation of Martin Scorsese's own oeuvre, and I wouldn't totally disagree with this assertion. Typical genre archetypes and a predictable plot line all make the film seem rather unoriginal, and Black Mass's John Connolly, who seems to be merely a more callow pastiche of The Departed's Colin Sullivan, is testament to Cooper's imitation. Overall, Scott Cooper's Black Mass offers us a stylishly dark package under the umbrella of an intriguing picaresque gangster biopic, in which the collaborative effort between leading cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi's and musical producer Tom Holkenborg stand out profusely. Masanobu Takayanagi's moody photography and Tom Holkenborg's tense musical choreography act in congruity, injecting even more insipid and sullen imagery into the disturbing milieu that is South Boston. But even if that doesn't quite do it for you, how can you turn down Cooper's all-star cast! The likes of which I have not seen for quite some time; Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Adam Scott, Joel Edgerton, Dakota Johnson, Peter Sarsgaard¬Ö it seems an endless list to which the movie belonged to Johnny Depp. It is a role that he has had some experience dealing with in the past and it is within this confident framework that Depp does his deepest work in a very long time. Yet whilst Cooper's rendition of James 'Whitey' Bulger and John Connolly's fall from power will certainly win the vote of those looking for a complete 'biographical crime thriller', alas it's run time of 122 minutes, comprising of what some may call sporadic scene jumping, an episodic narrative structure and an amalgam of crime genre pastiches, is certain to question some viewers loyalties.Not bad.. But not Great This movie had a lot of hype in the first weeks of its release. After reading some reviews here saying that it was great and that Johnny Depp would win an Oscar/getting an Oscar nomination at least, I decided to watch the movie and realized 2 things: The movie is not great, and Depp will not have a nomination. Yes it is true that his acting was good. In fact, it was the best of Johnny Depp's acting for a long time. But I don't see any reason why the Academy should nominate him for best leading actor, considering that the movie didn't force him to be great. The script was not hard at all. It was well written though, and the cinematography was OK. The rest of the cast was good as well, since they were almost all great actors. I would say this movie is fun to watch, but in my opinion it should have more violence and explicit torture, since this was a movie about a Gang. Overall I will rate this a 7/10 Doesn't deserve more than that.Illustrious cast, phenomenal display by Johnny Depp but still I lost interest. Musing the fact that the 45-year-old director Scott Brooks has only 3 motion pictures to his name, BLACK MASS being the 3rd one, I am lost for words in the effort (please note: I state "the effort") that is involved in the biography of Whitey Bulger. Scott Brooks displayed an extensive creative capacity when he teamed up with Christian Bale in 2013 for OUT OF THE FURNACE. Endeavoring to reach further he perhaps may have crafted his best work up to date in BLACK MASS. This biography that unfolds a smidge of opaque American history is a near masterpiece of story telling if the soundtrack to the picture took a more powerful tone. When tales of turf wars are told and when the word mafia comes into play in any context, and if your experience to cinema stretches further than DC &amp; Marvel, then you are now toying with the name Corleone (Which isn't so ‚Äì characters fail to grow around Depp as the screenplay stubbornly clings onto him). Set in violent times BLACK MASS is a gruesome memento of the vehemence and goriness of turf squabbles starting in the early 70s. Johnny Depp is no Marlon Brando. However this is arguably one of the finest bit of acting Johnny Depp has done since his Caribbean ventures. Depp who is unequivocally one of the most adaptable actors of today fits the role of Whitey Bulger like a glove. I can only think of Leonardo Dicaprio, Tim Roth, Ray Liotta &amp; Oscar Isaac who could have even attempted this role apart from Depp. The Irish American convicted criminal and murderer (not at the time the movie is based) is brother to Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) a senator and friend to John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). Connolly who is an FBI agent brings in Whitey as a top echelon informant to the FBI. Whitey on the other hand goes along with this only in the interest of business. Trading secrets to gain turf over the Italian Mafia of Boston and being the top dog is his only interest.  Somewhere in this saturnine screenplay BLACK MASS loses momentum. Characters fall off weakening the plot and the movie as a whole. Kevin Bacons presence is authoritative and concentrated but is felt ill used just as Benedict Cumberbatch keeps popping in and out of the picture (What a waste of characters). Cinematography is poor and has room beyond it ever-even attempts. Shots of Boston, grim insights to what goes on after sunset are key elements that are overlooked. The audiences demand this. We know Whitey does, we wish we see more. Credit is to be given to Depp for he is the glue that keeps BLACK MASS intact. Went in hoping this is a contender for the big show in February 2016. It wont be! Johnny Depp may get a nod for his acting but isn't cut out for the win.  Illustrious cast, phenomenal display by Johnny Depp but still I lost interest. TITLE: BLACK MASS DIRECTED BY: SCOTT BROOKS STARRING: JOHNNY DEPP, BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH, JOEL EDGERTON, PETER SARSGAARD AND KEVIN BACON RATED: R RATING: 07/10It's easy to connect the dots between the Bosox, Patriots, and the . . . . . . Cradle of Corruption, a.k.a., Boston, MA, after viewing BLACK MASS. Known as Satan's Playground since its suburban Salem witch &amp; warlock days of the 1600s, BLACK MASS documents how James "Whitey" Bulger is one of the Devil's top Earthly minions, exporting his Evil Deeds to places as far-flung as Tulsa, Miami, and Ireland. In the 1900s, America's original "Title Town" sports capital was Detroit, MI. But now, as the Tigers and Lions languish, Bostonians Lord it over the rest of us with three World Series wins and umpteen Deflategators' triumphs in this End Times Century. Anyone who watched those eight-hour games between the Bosox and the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series could see plainly that "the fix was in." The bribed umpires gave the Bosox an average of four outs per inning, while finding some flimsy excuse to nullify most of the Yankee hits and runs. It STILL took an eternity for the lesser team, famously cursed by the Bambino, to "win." This is foretold 89 minutes, 20 seconds into BLACK MASS when Bulger's pet FBI-agent-turned-convicted-murderer John Connolly tries to bribe the incorruptible non-Bostonian federal prosecutor with Bosox tickets to a game in which the infamous Curt Schilling is pitching. "Boston Strong" sounds like one of Voldemort's mottoes from Harry Potter, when viewed in the context of BLACK MASS. Thanks to this movie, we have proof positive that Bulger is STILL corrupting America's sports scene from his prison cell with his Parseltongue messages to henchmen such as MLB umps, Schilling, NFL refs, and Tom Brady.I loved this movie! If you want a movie with insanely excellent acting skills, I would highly suggest watching Black Mass. I was consistently intrigued the entire film, and I felt very thrilled with all the exciting events. This story is based from true events that happened in the 1970's. I highly suggest watching this film because Johnny Depp does extremely well playing as James "Whitey" Bulger. He gives you a dark, creepy, and alluring effect on this character. When you watch it, you just want to know more about James "Whitey" Bulger. You feel so much emotion and thrill when watching this movie. I was constantly on the edge of my seat while I watched it in the theater. It was worth every penny spent, and it was an amazing night. I give it a 10/10!Are you pointing a finger at me? James "Whitey" Bulger (Johnny Depp) and John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) played cops and robbers on the playground and grew up and played it as adults. Whitey became an informer for FBI agent Connolly in exchange for protection, an alliance which he exploited. Based on a true story, the film's action and drama was a cut below its fictional counterparts. While Depp gives us a great performance, the film moved in a slow gear. We learned that jai alai is crooked, which is common knowledge to just about everyone. The characters in the film were very stiff for South Boston. And while Depp and the film will be nominated for something, I found it to be over rated and no better than a TV docu-drama. Watch "The Town" instead. Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.This is Depp's film from start to finish Had a less talented actor taken the lead in 'Black Mess', it wouldn't have been half the film it is. Johnny Depp completely carries this film, elevating what is some very average material and a generic script to something that is at least engaging and occasionally entertaining. His portrayal of notorious gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger is brilliant, and is the sole reason that 'Black Mass' is worth watching. Depp aside, this film doesn't have much going for it. As someone who watches a lot of crime/dramas, there's nothing about the storyline or script of 'Black Mass' that makes it stand out. It's dominated by scenes of blood and violence and often gets carried away with itself, but beyond the high level production and Depp's excellent acting, 'Black Mess' is just a standard gangster film.Depp Should Have Been Nominated Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Black Mass Depp gives a tour de force performance that reminds you why he was so much fun to watch in the first place. He shows us different sides of Bulger. We see the tender father, the loving son, the loyal friend and brother. But of course we see the cold, violent, psychopathic gangster. Depp's portrayal is by far the best thing he has done for years. Truthfully I expected an Oscar nomination, but it never came.  All the support cast is excellent; especially Joel Edgerton and Benedict Cumberbatch. Also look out for Juno Temple in a scene stealing sequence that begins outside a police station and ends in a deserted house. That's stayed with me, long after the movie ended. Peter Sarsgaardalso has some memorable scenes and I always like to see Kevin Bacon in a movie.  As good as the performances are, I don't love the movie. It's good to watch, but its not got much rewatchability. I don't like gangster/mobster movies in general anyway!! But I can still enjoy a great one. There are no heroes in this one, certainly no-one to root for (No Elliot Ness in Untouchables) except maybe incoming prosecutor Fred Wyshak (Corey Stoll), who begins the clean up at the FBI. The story is fascinating, although I wish it were done better.  Black Mass grossed $62 million at the domestic box office to end the year to 49th highest grossing movie of 2015. Which is pretty much on par with a movie starring Depp in his pre Captain Jack Sparrow days.Good but could've been great I remember liking this a lot when I first saw it, but on watching it a second time, there are a couple of problems. Depp's great here, there's no denying that, in fact the majority of the cast is great here, the main problem is focus. The film really has no plot, it just jumps from moment to moment, without any real connection. It's obviously about Bulger being an informant, but I feel like this could've been handled better than this. Scott Cooper has talent here though, he has a passion for what he does, but he's a bit overzealous with this being only his third film. It takes cues from other mob movies well, there's nothing here that feels like a blatant knock-off of "Goodfellas" or "Casino", and the story here could be interesting with better connectivity. In the hands of Scorsese, this would've been a classic, but Scorsese already did this, he did "The Departed". I know that comparison has been made a million times before, but it's just a better, more engaging movie than this. The performances are great, the premise is great, it just lacks focus. It hits all the bases, just not hard enough to really leave an impact. This might've worked better as a miniseries actually, not condensed into a 2 hour movie. I like Scott Cooper though, I think he has serious potential, similar to "Hostiles", a few minor changes and this would've been a lot better.Wigs won't cut it I know there's a fair school of through that says Johnny Depp's star has waned over recent years, but I was surprised that I'd never heard of 'Black Mass' until it was on sale on DVD. It sounded pretty good - a true life tale of how a gangster turned Government informer, plus it had a stellar cast including Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon and that creepy guy out of 'Breaking Bad' who looks a bit like Matt Damon. However, when I started watching it, I soon realised why it never really set the Box Office alight. It's dull. That's it. This is going to be a pretty short review. There's really not that much I can say about it. It's just boring. I suppose I've watched a lot of these gritty true-life gangster/snitch films in my time, therefore I couldn't see anything new here. However, I really do think that anyone fresh to the genre would find this a little slow and hard going. It may have a decent cast, but that almost becomes a problem. The film bounces around from actor to actor and from present to past and feels completely disjointed, like each scene doesn't really relate to the one that's gone before. Then, because every scene doesn't feel like it should follow the one before, the whole film comes across like one big series of mini stories where the actors are never allowed to show their considerable talents because none of them are ever allowed the time to do so. Whatever the public mood is towards Johnny Depp right now, he's always been one of my favourite actors and I'm certain he has plenty of good roles ahead of him. Just like I know he loves to immerse himself into whatever part he's playing and is more than happy to do whatever it takes to 'look the part.' As with 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' he's almost unrecognisable as the main character, sporting a balding hair piece and more than a few added wrinkles. However, it takes more than a good set of prosthetics to make a movie and, unfortunately, his passion for his craft doesn't save the film. It's not terrible, but for the cast that's been assembled for this production you'd be expecting something along the lines of 'Goodfellas.' Sadly, the only two words that come to mind here are 'boring' and 'forgettable' (sorry, Johnny). Low-level Godfather wannabe Honestly, I decided to see this movie only because of Johnny Depp and what I got is ... Johnny Depp and close to nothing else. Movie has terrible reviews but because of my experience with Depp's movies I refused to believe. Anyway, I most often love movies that are widely bashed on internet. This time, unfortunately, that was not a case. The film is based on the true story of the famous Boston mobster who spent decades at the FBI's Most Wanted List. Classic cliche crime drama about the mafia the likes of which we've seen many times in the past, and which does not bring anything new to this outworn genre. Not a trace of originality. Observed individually, this movie is pretty much nicely done, but in the context of the genre it is shallow and dull. Acting is good and it's practically everything that this movie has to offer. 6/10before we start.. Black Mass There is enough darkness in the lead character to give you goosebumps as you cringe yourself on the seat and luckily Johnny justifies it as he empowers each and every actor and character in this throwback of 70-80's old gangsta drama.Good Crime Drama The true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf. A pretty good film concerning Mafia families - The Godfather, Serpico, or even Donnie Brasco would make a great feature to go with Black Mass. 8/10A Bland Look at the Underground Boston Mob Scene, Black Mass Fails to Make Use of a Powerhouse Performance from Johnny Depp. I had gotten my hopes up for Black Mass, perhaps too high, when I heard Johnny Depp would be playing the lead role as infamous Boston gangster Whitey Bulger. Combined with director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) it was reasonable to think that Black Mass could be a triumphant return to Donnie Brasco form for Johnny Depp, and a strong gangster picture in its own right. Upon seeing the film, I was disappointed. Depp's Whitey Bulger lives up to the hype, but the movie around his performance never got me hooked. Black Mass recalls a period of time in the mid 1970s when Irish Mob Boss Whitey Bulger began working with his brother, Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) and FBI informant John Connely (Joel Edgerton), in an effort to take down the rival Mob families of Boston. Sure, it is an interesting true story, and Whitey Bulger is an interesting real life character, but the movie doesn't do enough to warrant a full-fledged dramatic film. Black Mass plays like a documentary. It follows certain characters, and explains the inner workings of the Irish Mob and the FBI. But this isn't a documentary, it's a crime drama. In a documentary, the interest comes from seeing the actual historical evidence of the story. In a film, you have to do more, and I never felt that Black Mass had anything of its own to say about Whitey Bulger, the Mob, or the FBI. The drama in Black Mass is incidental. All I saw was a film that tells me what happened, but not what it meant for anyone involved. The reason Black Mass doesn't work is not because of the performances. Individually, there is some great acting on display. Edgerton and Cumberbatch are convincing as meaty Bostonians, and Kevin Bacon gives a performance reminiscent of his work in Mystic River. Depp, however, is the main attraction, and his Whitey Bulger is the first truly Oscar-worthy performance from him in years. His cold, blue eyes can stare at the screen and tell you more about his character than any amount of writing can. And that's a good thing, because Bulger is not much of a character on the page. According to the script, he's a bad, bad, guy. Depp does all the heavy lifting. He fleshes out Bulger as much as humanly possible, illustrating his fierce connection to his son, and his hair trigger temper, but it's still not enough to save the film. Black Mass is not a bad film, but it is a misguided one. There are good performances all around, and hints of strong filmmaking, but the movie never managed to grab me. Simply telling Whitey Bulger's story is not enough. With only an admirable Johnny Depp performance to differentiate it from the countless crime dramas that have come and gone in Hollywood, Black Mass is destined to be forgotten. 43/100Perhaps Johnny Depp's strongest performance James "Whitey" Bulger ran South Boston's crime scene with an iron fist in the 1970s and 1980s, but for a good part of his reign of terror he harbored quite a secret ‚Äì he was actually an informant for the FBI. In particular, he was an informant for Agent John Connolly ‚Äì although the usefulness of Bulger's intel was often in dispute ‚Äì all the while continuing his violent rampage over the city against anyone who would stand in his way. The ruthless Bulger is played in Black Mass by Johnny Depp, an actor not really among the first who come to mind when the character of a crime lord is brought up. Depp has long been known for looking the part in each of his disparate roles and avoiding typecasting. But in Black Mass, even though he doesn't look like an Irish mobster ‚Äì he completely embodies one. It's really his finest work, and that's saying something. The movie is told in flashback, as a member of Bulger's inner circle recounts the whole sordid deal to another FBI agent, including the involvement of Connolly (Joel Edgerton) as well as Bulger's brother, state senator Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch). The brutality of Bulger's day-to-day existence isn't tempered; men and women are killed or maimed or harassed for seemingly benign reasons. There seemed to be no middle ground for Bulger. He liked you, you lived. He didn't, you didn't. The movie covers his feud against his Italian rivals in Boston, the Angiulo family, as well as his foray into the high-stakes world of betting on jai-alai in Miami. And how did Bulger get away with so much? Mostly through the protection of Connolly, who used Bulger's (scant) information to further his own career. Crooks protecting crooks. The rabbit hole is deep indeed. But man, is Depp ever great. I stopped thinking of him as Johnny Depp soon after the movie began. It's funny ‚Äì to look at Bulger in this movie, you probably wouldn't take him for a mob guy. He's wiry, he's balding, he wears glasses. Nothing tough leaps out at you. But the ferocity of Depp's exceptional performance puts that notion to rest. Cumberbatch, as his brother and fellow Boston native, is also very good and with a surprisingly believable accent. Kevin Bacon shows up as an FBI guy; I think this was his third go-around as a Boston-based law-enforcement officer.Well worth watching First off, although he is no longer the golden boy, John Depp's performance is captivating. He imbues a reality and depth of character which is faultless and reminds the viewer that he is more than a foppish pirate or a Tim Burton stooge but an actor of great range. The actual historicity is no doubt very much in question but this is still a good, entertaining movie. I agree with some other reviewers that this could easily have become a masterpiece with just a little bit of tweaking. Scorsese instantly springs to mind although I doubt that he would have cast Depp. Overall a very good movie with well fleshed out characters, well acted by a quality cast. Give it a view."Black Mass"- A fascinating true story of crime and corruption turned into a drab, mediocre gangster-flick... To be honest... I've actually never been a particularly big fan of crime and mafia-related film and media. I can see their value. And I can understand their appeal. It's fun to sort-of put yourself in the shoes of men and women who do terrible things and sort-of vicariously live through stories depicting the criminal underbelly of major cities. And it's fascinating to see how these stories can play out and how these people either thrive or ultimately fall. But I find myself quite picky when it comes to these sorts of films and typically only enjoying the better entries. Because frankly, for every "Godfather"... for every "Casino"... there's about a million and a half lesser or even overtly bad films or shows or stories dealing with this subject matter. So I try to look for the best of the genre on the odd day I find myself interested in watching one of these sorts of films. "Black Mass" is a strange and fascinating beast. Based on the enthralling and troubling real-life story of Boston gangster Whitey Bulger, and sporting a top-notch cast of wildly talented performers, this should have been an easy and surefire hit. And yet, director Scott Cooper and the screen writing duo of Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth deliver a film that never quite comes together. Only mildly entertaining and informing the audience with some shallow surface level thrills and admittedly fantastic performances... while ultimately feeling far too dry and clinical to really leave a mark. The ingredients are there, but the final product feels hollow and without any real substance. Watching this film is like trying to chew on air- there's just nothing there. Johnny Depp leads a star-studded cast, as the story follows Bulger's rise and fall in the Boston underworld over the course of a number of years, covering some of the major events of his life- from the tragic death of his son, through his troubling connections with the FBI as an exploitative informant, to several of the murders he was tied in connection to. And to give credit where it is due, Depp is a phenomena in his portrayal of Bulger, and the cast at large is quite good. Depp has always been an incredible persona in the world of entertainment, but as of late his performances have lacked variety and mainly fallen into the realm of "quirky goofballs." Here, we see his sheer talent at work, as he lets the role take him over completely. Supporting performances by the likes of Joel Edgerton, Kevin Bacon and Benedict Cumberbatch similarly light up the screen (though Cumberbatch hasn't quite nailed his American accent yet here), and it's just a joy to behold everyone on screen. This most certainly is an actor's film. And in terms of simple aesthetics, director Cooper does do a pretty stellar job in terms of his visual storytelling. The film is slick, gritty and definitely feels very true to life in terms of direction and flow, and Cooper's keen eye for composition and detail lends a lot to the proceedings. And this is wonderfully accented by cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi's superbly grounded lighting and some good, moody score by composer Tom Holkenborg. It's a well- crafted movie at very least in terms of production. But the issue here is the story and the portrayal of characters. And that's where it starts to fall apart and lose faith and interest from the viewer. While my knowledge of Bulger's life and dealings isn't quite vast, I do know a bit about him, and I know that his story could make for one hell of a film. But "Black Mass" doesn't really give us much outside of sheer, blatant details and facts. It's a very calculated film that doesn't really even attempt to delve in the heads of Bulger or his associates much at all, save for a few key scenes early on. It just presents facts over and over. Cold, hard facts. This happened. Then this happened. Then this happened. And it's monotonous for much of its screen time as a result. This could have been a very dark and provocative character study into the mind of a career criminal... instead, it feels like the writers are going down a studio mandated check-list of things they had to include. It takes the soulful performances of Depp and the others and strips away the humanity by not allowing us to care about them or at very least get invested in what's happening. Even with people like Bulger, there needs to be some degree of humanity or reason or exploration to the film for us to care. This is just a roughly-arranged timeline of "stuff happening." Hackneyed and trite in terms of structure and delivery. And it robs the film of virtually all potential... coming across more as a drab, dry and dreary presentation on Bulger than a compelling film about him. And that's why I just can't forgive the film, despite its remarkable performances and some admittedly solid direction. It's just such a chore of a film, lacking any entertainment or interest. And that's a shame. Depp deserves better. Heck, even Bulger deserves better in a way. And "Black Mass" just fails to meet its sky-high potential. I'm giving it a very mediocre 5 out of 10, and would only recommend it to the biggest of crime-story junkies and fans. All else really need not apply.Incredible performance from Mr. Johnny Depp I liked this biographical crime drama thriller from the director of Out Of The Furnace (2013), Scott Cooper, and starring Johnny Depp as the infamous Irish American Gangster, James "Whitey" Bulger. Depp gave an incredible performance with his scary looks that you don't want to mess with. I have heard some people say it's boring. However, it is a drama, and it's supposed to be slow. Regardless, I don't care what people say. I really love to see him in crime drama films more than other genres. Johnny Depp himself said that this is his favorite out of all the films he has done.Pretentiously disastrous For some reason I do not remember, I ended up watching this movie in the cinema. As the plot progressed, it became more and more pretentious, something like a failed attempt to copy the work of the great Marty Scorsese. Johnny Depp is an actor with abilities, manages to build a truly sinister character. Joel Edgerton effectively achieves an exasperating character for his idiocy and his pathetic pretense of being a gangster. The story is told in the typical flashback format from the point of view of a former gangster belonging to the Whitey Bulger (Depp) gang. The formula is repeated, we see his rise, his position in the neighborhood, his ally FBI agent John Connolly (Edgerton) who protects him, business with dirty politicians, loose ends, and of course all this converges in the predictable fall of these characters. Nothing new. Hollywood sometimes gets bored, and it comes up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã producing films with little innovative content, which repeat themselves as can be seen also in "American Hustle" (2013), in desperate attempts to emulate the masterful narrative of great films such as "Goodfellas" (1990), "Casino" (1995), or "Scarface" (1983).Johnny Depp does a great job in a bad movie I simply could not stay awake during this film. I'd check out for ten minutes at a time, then I just might be up for another ten minutes before I'd check out again. I feel that Johnny Depp was the best I have seen him in many years. The other actors in the movie are among my favorites most of the time, but not here. I can not deal with forced Boston accents. Those accents made it almost impossible for me to pay attention to just about anyone else in this movie. The writing created a story that was not compelling. Bottom line: The four stars in my rating are all owned by Johnny Depp.Overall decent attempt minus the details Exquisitely rendered period piece with stellar acting. The problem lies in its ad-hoc dramatization of the facts. The book upon which this film is based includes many details that are absent from the movie, as is typical of adaptations; yet here, it's a detriment. Consider for one Whitey Bulger grabbing a prepubescent boy from the neck and forcing him to give the reigning mob boss a blowjob... Is Johnny Depp with the cloud-steel blue contacts "dancing" without knowing the whole story? I'd guess not. In fact, i think that the boy- sex-scene wound up on the cutting room floor. In fact, I thonk that many vital scenes were cut to make the film of- appropriate-length and also legallly-acceptabe in terms of violence and sex that's acceptable by the ratings association. In the vein of films like "Goodfellas," this mob movie is subpar and solid. Yet it's content could've been extraordinary if indeed the scriptwriter had looked beyond the the mob clich√© to include its inspiration to the fullest.Decent Gangster Flick I personally am not aware that much of the real life Whitey Bugler, so can't really vouch for the authenticity or how true it is to the actual story. As a movie buff, I liked the movie, though it had a strong hangover of Goodfellas, Departed and Donnie Brasco. The movie though not in the league of these gangster classics, is still pretty much a good effort. One of the prime reasons is Johnny Depp, in the main role. Personally, am a big fan of Depp, but of late most of his performances have not really required him to do much, except to wear masks, or wigs and act funny. After quite some time, good to see him in a role that does not require him to clown around( notwithstanding the fake looking prosthetics). As a vicious, pyscopathic gangster he is brilliant, radiating menace, with his presence, a flick of the eye, or his measured way of speaking. Apart from the fact that Bulger seems to care for his son, there is not much that is redeeming about him. He is selfish and opportunistic, he plays along with his friend John Conolly( Joel Edgerton) a Fed agent, promising to help him out, but in reality uses him for his own selfish ends. He is ruthless, and pyscopathic to a level, where he gets rid of people, at the slighest suspicion. Matter of fact, he is the guy who does not even trust his own shadow. The movie at one level runs as a morality play too, on the dangers of setting a thief to catch a thief. Conolly tries to use Whitey to get to the Mafia, by using him as an informant. However Whitey turns the tables on him, by providing him basically with junk information, and uses it as a cover to get his own with the rival Anguilo gang. In a sense, Conolly causes his own downfall, by getting too cozy with Bugler, maybe it could have been due to his childhood friendship with him. At one level, it could also have been a traditional Irish-Italian rivalry in 70's Boston. Was Conolly soft on Bugler, due to the Irish factor, as well as the community feeling? And what exactly was the relationship between the Irish mob and the IRA? This is where I feel, Black Mass falters somewhat, the performances are good, the scenes are well written, but director Scott Cooper, just tries to pack in everything, without really delving deep. The movie looks more like a montage of elements from earlier gangster movies, dinner table talks where hints are dropped, the brutal in your face violence, the liberal usage of the F-word, the protagonist going into a downward spiral and pulling others along. And the scenes are pretty good too, one particularly good one, where Bugler has a dinner talk with Conolly and his associate Morris, where he almost threatens Morris into fear and then does not. Or the scenes between Whitey and his brother Billy( Benedict Cumberbatch) a senator. But the rivalry between Bugler and the Anguilo brothers is treated in a pretty sketchy manner. This is an area where so much could have been explored, especially the Irish vs Italian angle, but director Cooper just gives it a very cursory glance. Again the link between Bugler and the IRA is not explored in depth, we really do not know what motivates him to help them out. And due to this, it just remains a middlingly good movie, instead of a classic. The performances are pretty good, apart from Depp, one more great turn is by Joel Edgerton, as the FBI agent who makes a pact with the Devil himself. Benedict Cumberbatch is however wasted in a role that really does not do much justice to his talent.Boss Cast, By the Ton. Joel Edgerton as usual stepped in front of the camera, and did damage. He is an impressive actor, and is always wonderful to watch. Cumberbatch is always looking to stretch himself somehow, challenge himself as a true artist, and again, thumbs up. An Englishman who pulled off an Irish American accent pretty well, from what I could hear. Johnny Depp was absolutely amazing to watch. I'm not really drawn to any of his movies, or the type of roles he plays, so seeing him in something this different, and executing it so well, was a joy to witness. The rest of the cast, especially Jesse Plemons, were also pretty good. However, as good of a performances as every one of the actors achieved, Black Mass feels like a squandered classic. It lacked a certain extra, or necessary thrill, and much of the movie feels a bit too, forgettable. Black Mass is by no means a bad movie at all, it just, wasn't as good as it was perhaps meant to be. What carried it however, is something that should be a major contributor in any film, and that is the cast. The cast was just, noteworthy. I would seriously love to give Black Mass a 7/10, but, honestly, it falls a little short because, things are missing in it, and ultimately the film feels like something we've really seen many times before. So, 6.7/10, that I'll reluctantly round up to 7/10.A "Must-See" For All Gangster Movie Fans In this movie, a series of testimonies by a group of criminals tells the story of how the FBI and a mobster in 1970s' Boston entered into an extraordinary alliance to bring down the city's Italian mafia. Both sides co-operated with the aim of eliminating their common enemy but their collusion also resulted in the small-time mobster being given all the latitude he needed to develop into a criminal kingpin. Jimmy "Whitey" Bulger (Johnny Depp), the leader of South Boston's Winter Hill Gang, was involved in racketeering, extortion, controlling vending machines etc. but was also increasingly troubled by the Italian mafia who were steadily muscling in on his territory. When his childhood friend and FBI agent, John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) was assigned to clean up the city's North End, he immediately targeted the Italian mafia and persuaded his boss, Special Agent Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon), to let him exploit his friendship with Bulger to gather the intelligence they needed to bring an end to the mafia's operations. McGuire reluctantly agreed and a deal was subsequently struck between Connolly and Bulger. As a reward for his co-operation, the deal gave the gangster an assurance that he wouldn't be arrested. Bulger made good use of the protection he was given to carry on his criminal activities uninterrupted and after supplying Connolly with some useful information about the Italians, the FBI agent was able to bring them to justice. This enhanced Connolly's status within the FBI and removed Bulger's only criminal rivals. Connolly's loyalty to his old friend who, as a child, had protected him from bullies, then led to them socialising together and Connolly becoming ever more corrupt as he ignored or discredited any evidence that he was given against Bulger. Things then changed for the FBI man when a new "by-the-book" prosecutor was appointed and Connolly suddenly found that, from that time on, he would have to play strictly by the rules. Director Scott Cooper does a great job of condensing all the important elements of this true story into a hard-hitting end-product that convincingly recreates the era in which it's set. The dialogue is also economical and sounds very authentic, especially in the FBI interviews with Bulger's closest associates. The action features a great deal of brutality, profanity and corruption and a tremendous number of executions, with many carried out by Bulger himself. He's a terrifying psychopath whose volatility and paranoia provoke him into killing even when his victims don't necessarily present any great danger to him and so it's interesting to see the various passages of the film in which his more human side is depicted. In these scenes, he's shown as a kind father and a loving son who's helpful to old ladies. It's striking just how strong Connolly's bonds are with the characters that he grew up in the same neighbourhood as him and it's this loyalty that paved the way for an arrangement which gave Bulger's gang the freedom to carry out their criminal activities for so long without any adverse consequences. It's also interesting that Bulger's brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) was a state senator during the period when the gangster's arrangement with Connolly was in force. The quality of the cast in this movie is exceptional with everyone providing superb performances and the unrecognisable Johnny Depp absolutely immense in his role as Bulger. "Black Mass" did well commercially and is definitely a "must-see" for all gangster movie fans.Black Mass Review Johnny Depp movies are hit or miss. This one is a line up the middle for a base hit. Nothing was really spectacular about the movie, but then again, there wasn't much that hurt the movie too much either. Stick around and see what I really thing. Synopsis: Based on a true story of James "Whitey" Bulger, an Irish Mob godfather and FBI informant who had a "secret trading" deal with his brother, William "Billy" Bulger, a state senator and a Boston public figure, and John Connolly, an FBI agent. They planned to take down the Italian mob and mafia in Boston, which went awry and things turned massively violent. When the credence for each other began fading out, drug dealing, murders, and extortion started to rise, and forced the FBI's Boston office to confirm that Whitey Bulger was one of the most notorious criminals in US history and also one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List criminals. Starring: Johnny Depp Joel Edgerton Director: Scott Cooper First off, let's get the one thing out of the way that hurt the movie the most. Yes, this is a movie about the entirety of Whitey "working" with the FBI. Yes, everyone knows everything that Whitey said was completely false or was fabricated from older reports that lasted from the seventies into the nineties. At least let us know when you change time eras though. They did a couple of times, but for the most part they didn't let us know. I had to look at the clothing, cars, and various other objects to try to figure out when in time the movie was happening. Don't make people guess as to what is going on unless it is a strong mystery. If it is a true story, let people know when things are happening. The good things of the movie, other than the story which I won't go into, are the actors. Every single person was the right person for the job. The only thing I didn't like was that the age difference between Johnny playing Whitey and Dakota Johnson playing his was completely wrong. I know he used to be married to a woman that is the same age as Dakota, but still. There are better actresses for that type of thing. And I know it's nitpicking, but so what. It's how I feel. Keeping with the actors, Joel Edgerton is a chameleon when it comes to acting. He can do it all it seems. Has this guy ever made a bad movie? I don't think so. He is just that amazing. I never heard of Scott Cooper before I saw this movie. When I looked him up, it seemed I have seen a few movies of his, but nothing that stood out. Same goes for this movie. It is just there. Final Thoughts: If you have seen other crime movies that take place in Boston you have them all. Even though this is a true story, it seems that all the crime movies based in Boston take from the Whitey Bulger story. I'm thinking that is why I was not impressed with this movie. Still watchable though. Rating: 7 out of 10Black Mass a film or a documentary film Black Mass 2015 directed by Scott Cooper should not be called a movie but a documentary film not on the life of James Whitey Bulger but on the hideous and gruesome murders committed as a true criminal as Stevie would say about Bulger in the film.  Briefly, the spectator is drawn in all the horrendous killings Bulger committed or had other people do for him. Not much is said when it comes to his growing up in South Boston with the Winter Hill gang or his stay in Alcatraz and how everything led to his perverted life as what could be called serial killing. There are two scenes worth the watching and it is that, first of all, the dinner scene where he will slowly manipulate Morris by showing some form of humanity where friends gather around the table, forgetting for a moment the evil they bathe in when Bulger to Morris says ''You and I gotta have a little sit-down here, only to talk especially about the recipe of making a good marinade steak. As a spectator, I believed the dinner scene would be some form of escape from the drudgery of their lives as thugs, to bring in some relief of what it is to escape for a moment the life of crime, however , the evilness of who Bulger is, is at its utmost perfection. No humanity exists in the underworld. The second is how Bulger's murder's Stevie's stepdaughter in front of Stevie himself and not acting to protect her. How can a person stand to see someone who is part of a family even if by alliance like being a stepdaughter not react? Probably, when Stevie begins his confession to the FBI and when asked how he would describe his boss. The camera is focused on Stevie's face and on a closeup shot he replies ''A real criminal''. I assume his inaction towards the killing of his step daughter is one of admiration towards his boss or the fact that he is so involved in murders that now, if he would act against his boss he would act against himself thus leading to his death if discovered. No one knows. An excellent film, yet, a solid heart is needed to see a film such as this one where almost 2 hours of murders are shown that goes beyond what one can imagine what crime life is all about.Truth Stranger Than Fiction There are certain genres of movies I like such that if they are done halfway good I will like the movie: Westerns, Biopics and Gangster movies. I can hardly think of a gangster movie I didn't like (with the exception of Godfather 3... ~shudder~). Black Mass, besides being a true story, really reminded me of The Departed. You had Boston as the setting, gangsters, informants and a man inside law enforcement assisting a known gangster.  The acting all around was great. Johnny Depp is super as the ruthless mob boss Jimmy Bulger. Joel Edgerton (whom I've never heard of) was exceptional as the ambitious yet loyal FBI man John Connoly. It is a classic gangster tale much like many others except this one is real, it occurs in Boston and it had the interesting dynamic of FBI sanctioning. Again, it is much like The Departed but I still saw it as its own entity.Authentic Story of a Life of Crime "The Friends of Eddie Coyle" and "The Departed" are probably both better movies about crime in Boston than "Black Mass." Johnny Depp's brilliant performance as Whitey Bulger, by itself, raises the level of this movie to equal them. This movie captures the grittiness of many Boston neighborhoods in much the same way "Mystic River" did. The story is a cautionary tale about power, in this case as wielded by the FBI, and counts as one of many black marks against an agency that rewards ambition more than integrity. The treatment of Billy Bulger, Whitey's younger brother, who rose to become President of the Massachusetts Senate and President of the University of Massachusetts, is nuanced but perhaps overly kind. I lived in Boston during much of this time, and in Southern California when Whitey was apprehended, so I was aware of much of this story. What I really didn't know was the high proportion of his associates who ultimately turned state's evidence against him.Crapfellas What you have heard about Depp's performance is true, he is AMAZING in this movie. Probably his best role since the 90's. However, this movie doesn't have a interesting supporting cast or a well structured narrative to make this good.  The main problem is how serious this movie takes itself. There are no jokes or funny situations during the 2 hour run time. That's fine, a serious movie is not a bad movie, but the reason Goodfellas is a masterpiece is because it has interesting characters. The crime genre needs likable characters to make you interested in what's going on. Edgerton is not a good actor, Cumberbatch is barely in the movie and everybody else is so forgettable that I can't remember anybody's name. And the jump in time are so sudden that you never realize when something it's supposed to be happening between 1975-1985. It's ¬®Black mass¬® a bad movie?, yeah, its uninteresting, filled with boring characters and lacks the sexiness and excitement of the best mafia based stories, and if the source material doesn't have it, then don't adapt it. 6.1/10 decentGood Gangster Film Black Mass (2015)  *** (out of 4)  Violent telling of Boston criminal James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp) who started as just a small crook but quickly rose to be one of the biggest crime lords out there. A lot of this was due to his childhood friend John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), a FBI agent, who began working with the criminal in exchange for information. BLACK MASS really wasn't as great as I was hoping it would be but there's no question that it's a solid film that managed to features some very good performances. I think the film falls short of being great for a number of reasons but one of the biggest is the fact that we've seen this type of gangster film countless times before and there's really nothing here that separates this film from various others out there. I will say that the best thing about the film was the performance from Depp who really sinks his teeth into this role. Depp had been criticized for some of his film choices over the past few years but this is certainly him jumping back into the game and showing what he can do. I thought he was extremely good here and especially with that coldness he brought the character. He's surrounding by some nice support from Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgaard, Rory Cochrane and Dakota Johnson. The gangster genre has delivered some of the greatest movies ever made and it's created some rather by-the-number films that were quickly forgotten. I wouldn't say this film is going to be forgotten but it's certainly not going to reach the levels of GOODFELLAS, THE GODFATHER or WHITE HEAT. With that said, there's a nice little story here, some great performances and some graphic violence that makes it worth watching.A deep, dark¬Ö Black Mass Black Mass is dark. Interesting name really. I quite like the title. I know it is based on a book, but still ‚Äì really catching and for me just the name invokes mystery and deep thinking. The movie is based on the infamous Boston gangster Jimmy "Whitey" Bulger of the notorious Winter Hill Gang. Most of the film takes place between the 70-90s. The reason to see the film: Johnny Depp. Reasons not to see the film: not a super-duper structured narrative some things just happen (like life). And it is quite dark (also like life). But if you would rather have a Nolan-esque/rainbows film, this is not it. MILD SPOILERS: Black Mass is a pulsating look into the life of a cold-blooded gangster. Most of the film, Whitey seems to be of the same demeanor, but worsening at the death of his son and the death of his mother. At the end of the film, Whitey's closest associate is asked by the FBI in seemingly current year about their relationship, and he remarks, "It was strictly criminal." What an intriguing way to describe a human relationship. I guess that is the mobster way of saying it was strictly business.  Johnny Depp was truly incredible in this film. Overall, I like Depp. I think he is an incredible versatile actor (despite personally rebelling from watching any more Pirates of the Caribbean Films after the second film maybe third). I read somewhere that it took over 20 hours to apply the makeup to make Depp look the ghoulish part of Whitey. In a recent interview, Depp got some flack for "humanizing" Whitey too much while he was trying to prepare for the role. Depp stated that Whitey, had a cold heart, but a caring heart. Some of the victim's surviving family members of the real life mobster were quite incensed. But, should anyone have to humanize anyone else. I'm sure even the world's worst gangsters, dictators, and serial killers had fears, loves, dreams, and they wet the bed when they were little. People are human (full stop). Even gangsters. What lead to the creation of such a heinous murderer, which was Whitey Bulger? Who knows. I'm reminded of one of my favorite quotes (which I used in my second feature film), "If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?" ‚Äï Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956Could get few Academy nominations... Johnny Depp... that man can play anyone - anytime - anywhere. Best actor nominee could be a strong possibility. Make-up artists have done their job primely also. Without that - the movie have this amazing story which is featured in an excellent way and thing I liked the most is the fact that in some scenes you have to think really hard - why did that just happen? Why did he do that? Sometimes you figure it out on your own and sometimes the movie tells you the details later. Always nice to watch a movie inspired by interesting, true story and when its so well made - you cant dislike this film. I guess I can call it my crime-mafia type movie favorite and I would strongly suggest You to watch it.Horrible Movie Horrible Screenplay and a horrible Cast this a Protest Review: as a movie Fiend first and as a Bostonian second Horrible Movie Horrible Screenplay and a horrible Cast..Johnny Depp was good as usual Kevin Bacon was alright but the rest of the cast is basically talent less... who is casting these days in HollyWeird??? not worth the 10 bucks or more importantly the wasted time. they should've had a cast like the Departed (2006) and a better plot not a bunch of low tier wanna be and non presentable British or OZ talent less cast well funded and well represented...it's a shame what's happening to the film industry in HollyWeird. it really gets weirder everyday i Rest my Case.disappointed I won't focus on the plot line here. I'm just here to tell you that this movie is highly offensive. They use homophobic phrases to insult each other. I don't think it's okay to make a movie where they say the f-word for gay men so often. It made me really sick. Not even Johnny Depp and Benedict Cumberbatch can make that remotely okay. Plus there were barley 10 sentences in the whole movie, where they didn't use the f-word multiple times.  Don't waste your time with it. I only managed to watch one hour of the movie before i had enough of getting insulted.  The actors performances were without any doubt great. And this will be the first movie with Johnny Depp that I'm not going to finish watching.
A pointless reboot which fails to improve on the original film in almost every manner possible Based on a scientific project that Reed Richards (Miles Teller) has been developing (which can transfer matter from one dimension to another) the Fantastic Four use themselves as Guinea Pigs in order to transfer themselves to another dimension (in the belief that there is something in this other worldly dimension that will benefit their own planet). However, something goes wrong for our foursome during the transportation process and they end up with drastic physical transformations (some which are much more noticeable than others). Worse still, they tried and failed to save Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and leave him behind believing him to be dead. Later on, a team go back to the other dimension and discover that Victor is still alive and bring him back to Earth in order to assess his condition. But Victor has no intention of staying on Earth and is determined to create a new world in this other dimension and will stop at nothing to achieve his objective. Victor has also suffered a physical transformation, but he has become much stronger and more powerful than his former friends and the Fantastic Four find that they must work together to try to stop him from carrying out his evil plans. The film opens up with some promise whereby we're given an insight into how our illustrious foursome ended up becoming the formidable team that we saw in the earlier films. Despite a fairly promising beginning though this reboot completely fails to bring about a lot of the magic that we witnessed in the 2005 version of this film. A big problem for me lay with the tone of the film; firstly it takes itself WAY too seriously and as a result it made the film quite boring to watch. When watching this it felt like I was watching a science documentary (with all its wordy geeky exposition) rather than what should be a fun comic book type movie. This brings me on to my next point 'What fun'? In the 2005 film (and the 2007 film as well) there was much more in the way of camaraderie between the cast making the film much more fun to watch. As a villain Von Doom isn't particularly well-developed here and I felt his motivations for world-domination were a little sketchy here - I criticised Von Doom's motivations in the original film, but compared to his motivations here they now seem more plausible in retrospect. I appreciate that this is a reboot and therefore the filmmaker's are trying to put their own stamp on things (presumably that explains why Johnny Storm is black in this film and also explains why their powers have been attained in a different manner to the original film). The problem with this reboot is that they've failed to do anything to improve on the original film; the story isn't as interesting, the characters are much weaker and are poorly developed, there is no real exploration of their super powers (this was a big thing in the previous films and made sense as they were a big life-changing aspect for the foursome), but here they just kind of have the super powers and then that's it - off to destroy Victor Von Doom. The only real super power that is explored is that of The Thing and even that super power is exploited in a rather lame way. The cast are another big problem with this film as they totally failed to engage with me (as well as each other); Miles Teller is really bland as Reed Richards (even more bland than Ioan Gruffudd was in the original films) which is surprising as he put in a very good performance in Whiplash 2 years ago. Kate Mara is very pretty, but she's terrible in this film (again probably worse than Alba was in the original films). Michael B Jordan tries his best as Johnny Storm, but he lacks the charisma that Evans brought to the role in the original films and as a result suffers badly in comparison. The Thing for me is probably the best character in the film, but he lacks the touching back story that we lay witness to in the original film and again suffers from not being developed sufficiently enough to make me really care about him here. The ending is also poor and lacks any kind of intensity and tension and has the Fantastic Four doing 'the obvious' to wrap the film up. All in all it's a very disappointing film where the serious tone is perhaps a bigger enemy to the film than Doctor Doom. It's big and bloated, but it's also boring, and lacking in both fun and imagination. I'd recommend giving it a wide berth.Anything But Fantastic Fantastic Four (or as many call it Fant4stic) is a comic book movie starring Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell, Directed by Josh Trank, was produced by Twenty-First Century Fox, and has the run-time of 100mins (1hr40mins). This is the 4th movie (and 3rd theatrical one) in the Fantastic Four Franchise. Now despite the hate i actually liked the last 2 movies in the franchise (Fantastic Four 2005 and Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer, please don't kill me). Now this Movie has been out for almost a year now but has still been getting much hate. To prove my point I would just like to say the movie has a 9% on Rotten Tomatoes which is tied for the worst rated superhero movie of all time. Let me just say I am NOT a professional critic, I just go to movies to have a good time(as shown with my liking of the old Fantastic Four movies) not necessarily to look for major flaws. However this movie makes that goal rather insufferable. Anyways here it is.  A lot of people give a pass to the acting simply because these actors have done good work in other movies. Personally I find this to be a terrible excuse. All of these actors such as Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller just seem like they have no soul throughout the entire movie. It's almost as if the whole time these actors had been forced into making this movie. Also the chemistry between them is just awful. Now let's talk about the pacing. Simply put it I have no idea what they were thinking. Why would you make a Fantastic Four movie and have them do absolutely nothing the whole time except for that horrendous fight at the end. Now let me just say Superhero movies without much action can be done well (Batman, X-Men: First Class, etc.) but if your going to do that you have to having interesting conversations and a good origin story which this movie does not have in any way. Speaking of origin stories, am I the only one who almost hated the first half as much as the second half. I mean I know a lot of people who say that the first half is pretty good and all I have to say is how. It's just a drawn out, overly dark useless story that EVERYBODY knows. Then there's the tone, which let my question why did they think that make a dark and gritty reboot of Fantastic Four would be a good idea. Again let me just say, a darker story of a previously existing light heart movie isn't necessarily bad. But it has to have more reason then some executive saying "Hey The Dark Knight was popular let's make this just like that." Then there's the part I was most regretting talking (or writing) about the Action and Effects. Let's get out of the way that Dr.Doom and CGI Miles Teller Face is awful. What I wanted to talk about was the action sequences (or just the 1 action sequence). To be honest it's the most clich√©, predictable fight ever. Basically what happens is that Dr.Doom makes this ray thing that shoots into earth from the planet he's in and The Fantastic Four have to stop him. So they go into the other planet and try to fight off Dr.Doom separately and fail so they decide to team up and defeat him. What I hate about this fight (aside from it's predictable nature) is that the whole scene is shot in extreme darkness plus it's all out of frame so you can barely tell what's going on. Last, I would like to quickly mention the forgettable score, the incredible amount of plot holes such as Dr.Storm going to a science fair for some reason, Dr.Doom magically making a cape, and Dr.Doom looking at people and killing them but not doing that for the Fantastic Four. Also just to say it is incredibly obvious Fox wanted to make some sort of MCU with this movie and set up an entire expanded universe around this movie when it cannot hold it's own weight as a good movie to do something like that. Conclusion Now as you could probably tell I do not like this movie, it has awful pacing, terrible effects,a rehashed story,and laughably bad action. While many have pointed out that Fox took over the project and made it a generic superhero movie. I agree with that but I still don't think the part that wasn't taken over was even passable. It was just Josh Trank redoing the exact same plot as the 2005 version but slower. But the worst part is that the whole movie is just a set up for more Fantastic Four movies with a set up scene every 5mins. This movie has been called by many the worst superhero movie ever and I will personally agree with that. At least Batman and Robin had an overly joking theme and never took itself seriously unlike Fant4stic which thinks it is going to be the Next Iron Man which could never happen because Iron Man actually made a good movie before setting things up. Overall i think the movie has too many problems to count such as bad pacing, no structure, and awful effects to even be close to recommending. Rating 1/10 UnwatchableThe not so fantastic 4 Imagine the worst superhero movie you've ever seen. Then forget it because this is by far the worst. When I heard they were doing a remake I thought " this could definitely work". You see the old movies from 05 and 07 was in my opinion somewhat dull and half decent. But all the flaws from there suddenly seemed to pale when I saw the remake. 30 minutes in I found myself staring at a bird outside the window, and that was more interesting than the actual movie. Then 15 minutes or something later something finally happened. Our heroes teleports to this alternate dimension and they got there powers and etc etc. The INCREDIBLY SLOW pace is a major problem with this movie. Then there's the casting. I've seen some things that these actors have don previously, before this. Kate Mara in House of Cards for example. And however good they were there it was zero chemistry here. Then of course there is Hollywood back at it again with the political correctness. I don't consider myself a huge comic-book fan, but every one who has ever heard of Fantastic 4 knows that Johnny and Sue Storm are brother and sister and therefore the flame is not black. There is nothing wrong with a director who wants to do his own interpitation of a comic-book series, but changing something as fundamental as this is never a good idea. Compared to this, the old movies seem good.Offensively bad I don't think you can make a movie like this unless you really, truly dislike the content - and harbor a great deal of enmity towards anyone who might like it. The effort necessary to get everything wrong, to miss every beat, to offend every memory that someone might have that would inspire them to go risk *another* attempt at this franchise; that has to come from a place of real disgust, I think.  What is amazing is how regularly that kind of pointed loathing seems to be given the reigns of properties that an audience really cares about.  Aside from the deep spiritual mistreatment - which is difficult, given how weird and wobbly the Fantastic Four are, to begin with - the pacing is poisonous, with the bulk of the film dedicated to what feels like an attempt at an involved origin story, but where the characters aren't really given anything to do, or to care about. In an attempt to avoid being explicit with motivations, I think, the characters instead limp around under the shadow of intentions - maybe Johnny is upset with his dad? Maybe Ben is looking for purpose? It's possible Richards spent his time in exile trying to help his friends? It's hard to say - better filmmaking could have answered these questions subtly. It didn't happen here. This is a joyless, uninteresting movie, with a cast that looked like they were waiting for something else to start, and I don't understand how they could spend all that money on a movie that looks this bad - designs, to sets, special effects; it's all incredibly dated and generic. One of the worst movies I've ever watched.Fantastic Flop Over the last decade, we have seen a number of superhero movies get a much needed reboot. After the atrocious Batman &amp; Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man.  Eight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice? Reed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years. When they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth. The one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start. When a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong. I had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy. The story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur. Then there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot. Fantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.Reboot Rubbish: The Fantastic Four So when I saw that they're "rebooting" Fantastic Four, I thought, "this could actually be really good. This has the chance to start things over and be something great." The trailers showed potential - they featured a new premise with some great new concepts. Also, take note that I'm not a superhero/comic book fan. I am a filmmaker, though.  Josh Trank is the director of this film. He also directed the film Chronicle, and I think that's a great movie, with several characteristics that are actually similar to this film.  I think the first major clue for me that this movie was doomed was, surprisingly, its tagline. "Change is coming". As a filmmaker, I know that a big concept movies want to have nowadays is "everything changes" - the idea that everything is started over or some big event is going to happen. One of The Amazing Spider-Man 2's taglines was "everything changes". Transformers 4 had the tagline of "the rules have changed" and "everything will change". This film's taglines are "change is coming", and "when you change the world, prepare to defend it". Movie taglines dealing with "change" are typically weak and overused methods of making movies seem like they're creating a "clean slate", or for lack of a better word, a reboot. If your movie tagline deals with change - at least make the film somewhat memorable. These three movies weren't memorable.  Another major clue for me that this movie was doomed was its running time of 100 minutes. Why? Because when you have a film like this - a reboot, where it has to introduce various new characters, set them up and a new premise/universe, the movie isn't going to be an hour and a half long. It's going to be two hours. Those extra twenty- thirty minutes can make a difference. For the record, the first two Fantastic Four movies had around the same running time. The original film was only six minutes longer. But that movie wasn't the best one, either.  I reminded myself of X-Men. X-Men was a great movie. It had a similar running time, but not the same task, as it wasn't a reboot. Yet as the first installment in a franchise, it did a fantastic job at setting things up. There isn't much that's fantastic about Fantastic Four.  Now to tell you what's wrong with this movie. First off, the pacing. The running time really is a problem. This film is rushed beyond belief and its plot is nonsensical. The characters' introductions are decent enough, particularly the Fantastic Four, but their roles throughout the rest of the film are disconcerted. It gets very boring when things are meant to be exciting. Exposition can be tiring, but after the exposition ended and the action was supposed to pick up - it didn't. Second, the plot. As I said above, the film's plot seemed interesting. It had potential and it looked like it could go somewhere, especially considering how superhero movies nowadays have managed to flesh out their stories and make them very enjoyable. There are even hints at awesome things to come at certain points. But the film's in shambles. You hope and feel it will go somewhere, but in its hour and a half running time, it feels so empty. One of the reasons for that is the third thing, the writing. The writing isn't good - the film's climactic conflict feels backed up into the end of the movie, because there wasn't enough time to set it up. The writing caused the pacing to be terrible - transitions between scenes weren't good and some scenes either went on for too long or were far too short. This movie shouldn't have been afraid to be longer (or the studio should've let it be that way) - it could have done that and been so much better. I also don't know why the Torch was played by a black actor. Again, I'm not a comic-book fan, and I'm certainly not racist, but I know enough to know that the Torch is white. I don't understand why they couldn't keep him that way. The acting of the Fantastic Four as a whole was "okay". But they just didn't feel like a team - there was no bond between them, and that's what should certainly be established in a movie like this. That's a big thing that killed this film, was the lack of teamwork. Seeing them together in the movie just felt so bland because there was no real interaction between them. There are so many big, obvious things wrong with this movie. Speaking of "things", The Thing is entirely CGI. No make-up, costume or anything - just a giant, naked rock monster. Yes, he's naked, too. Not even any shorts. Huh.  Reboots, remakes, prequels and sequels are pouring in nowadays, and many of them are constantly bombing. Fantastic Four is, unfortunately, one of them. But I'm still very surprised over just how bad it turned out. This film is currently a box office catastrophe.. Very few superhero movies within the last decade have a rating as low as this one does. It currently has a 3.9 rating on here, an incredibly low 9% on Rotten Tomatoes, and perhaps the lowest Metascore I've seen for a modern superhero movie - 27/100. Putting the critics aside, which is what should typically be done - this movie is a boring, weak, irrational attempt to reboot the Fantastic Four series.  By the way, a sequel is set to come out in June 2017. Good thing they announced that before the film came out ... a few months ago, of course. If you know what happened to The Amazing Spider-Man series, you may know what could very well happen here. Ultimately, while I wasn't pleased with the film, I do hope you enjoy it more than I did.Awful Sorry but this movie misses the mark big time. Compared to the 2005 Movie which was perfect, this one is just really bad. The story is OK but not executed well. The characters are not as portrayed in Marvel. Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm, why? Political correctness gone mad. Johnny Storm was not a black man. Kate Mara compared to Jessica Alba? Well there is no comparison really. And Ben Grimm is really just some overdone cgi, nothing compared to Michael Chiklis brilliant portrayal in the earlier movies. The biggest question about this movie for me is why? Why was it made when the 2005 version got it so right?fantastic four = fantastic bore Terrible movie as previous reviewer writes the pacing is all wrong the characters are bleh you don't feel any attachment to them with them creating no chemistry.The middle section of the movie is drawn out while the climax feels rushed like the director went gosh where running out of time quick rap it up. After the recent awesome avenger movies and the Thors this felt like some hacked together 1990s offering.The story has so many gaps in it with supposedly super smart scientist doing super stupid things and Miles Teller playing Mr Fantastic is just a terrible choice he has no screen presence as a leader. Wait for DVD or what ever and let it go quietly in to the past .This movie is a waste of time I began watching this movie with great anticipation, however, it really failed me within twenty minutes of it. I still continued to watch it and thought that the movie would get kicked off now but the now never came. The worst thing is that the invisible girl got her powers without going to space and that is so stupid because all my life I have been brought up seeing the girl in space and getting power, not outside of it. More than an hour into movie and there is no action. The villain appears in the last thirty minutes, the fight lasts of 10 minutes and the movie is over. Really a waste of time and money.Had potential, but a total dud This movie had potential to be bigger than the rather 'bleak' 2005 version. I wasn't overly impressed with the younger cast but thought maybe they would take a different aspect on the film. I was also keen on how Dr. Doom would be portrayed and how he would influence the film as a villain.  I couldn't be more wrong.  -There was limited character back-story on the Fan 4 -There was no middle just a five minute climax at the end that was hardly gripping -The cringe-worthy quotes towards the end of the film were just punishing to watch -Dr. Doom looks like a Droid and goes completely insane over a minor issue and the movie doesn't quite explain why -Dr. Doom is also meant to be one of the most O.P characters in the comics but yet he seems to drop down to the levels of the Fan 4 in the final battle which previously you saw him destroy anything in his path previously. -Whats the go with Tim Nelson being in this movie seriously can they stop regurgitating actors from previously failed ' marvel ' movies and maybe have a fresh start for some characters, especially for someone with a mediocre role as he had -Not really a huge issue but very disappointingly no after credits scenes which are signature to marvel based moves ( even though it is owned by FOX )  The only reason I have given it a 3 is the visual effects, only for one character though. The Thing looked insane compared to the 2005 version, only problem was due to the short length of the movie he got limited time and whipped out some really punishing quotes towards the end of the movie. Also I did like Franklin Storm in this film, he was a breathe of fresh air...but again wasn't perfected pulling out some pretty cheesy lines. So overall it was a total dud, no background characterisation on the characters, if there was it was limited and to go along with the short running time, it was hard to watch. Dialogue was just really, really average and I spent a lot of time watching the movie with my hands on my head in agony.A deplorable attempt at cashing in on something that didn't have a chance in the first place. Fantastic Four started catching my eye in the casting stage. Seemingly not giving a damn about the source material, it was refreshing to see those kind of balls especially from Marvel. While I welcome Michael B. Jordan as The Human Torch, I wish I could say the same thing about the rest of the film. Fantastic Four is merely a reboot that loses its steam after the first act. Coming in at just over an hour and a half, the film is a rushed piece of reject summer movie drab. The characters are paper thin and about 10 years too young for their respective roles. The visual effects are far from stunning, especially The Thing, whose transformation into the ghastly beast is something closer to a PS2 game than an actual film with a $100 million price tag. Miles Teller proves here that his performance in Whiplash is truly a fluke. As Mr. Fantastic, he struggles to sound like he knows what he is talking about. Perhaps a little more rehearsal time and a little less focus on that cheap looking silver streak in his hair could have benefited him. Kate Mara as Susan Storm is about as idiotic as it can get. Mara is a great actress, there's no other way about it but Kate Mara as Susan Storm is terrible and borderline embarrassing. The biggest shock here in this film is where all the controversy started...Michael B. Jordan as The Human Torch. Jordan's ability to be a badass likable gear head is insanely good. He's the best part of this film by far. If there is anyone that could single handedly carry this film on their back, it is him. The film overall is too dark for Fantastic Four and too shallow for Marvel which leaves it drifting somewhere between ridiculous and not necessary...and at times, both. If there's any movie to see this summer, I can assure you, Fantastic Four is NOT it.An empty plot and nonexistent character development make this reboot of Marvel's iconic superhero quartet a pointless exercise in ignominy Just because you can do it doesn't mean that you should ‚Äì and this wholly unnecessary and woefully terrible reboot of Marvel's most famous superteam is proof of that axiom. Say what you may about Tim Story's earlier cinematic adaptations, but as generic and middling as they were, they were at the very least entertaining. Unfortunately, the same cannot even be said of Josh Trank's back-to- basics origin story, which plays like a humourless retread of his debut film 'Chronicle' but on a bigger budget ‚Äì and lest there be any doubt, it is far, far from fantastic. Not that it doesn't demonstrate such promise; the first act which establishes the friendship between the visionary Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and his tough-guy longtime best pal Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) as well as the team dynamics between Reed and the other members of his research team ‚Äì the equally brilliant Sue (Kate Mara), her hot- headed younger brother Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), and malcontent genius Victor Von Doom (Toby Kibbell) ‚Äì capably lay the foundation for what could have been a character-driven drama based on their clashing personalities. Indeed, after the boys sans Sue decide on a whim following a night of intoxication to put their teleporting machine to the test, how they respond to their newfound super-powers individually and as a team should be an organic evolution from how they were before. Alas, Trank, who co-wrote the screenplay with 'X-Men' veteran Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, doesn't quite know where to go from there. Rather than setting them on a course that would follow the perennial 'X-Men' theme of inclusiveness versus insularity against the rest of society, our teenage super-heroes are pretty much seen only in an isolated military facility where they are trained and from which they are deployed on covert operations overseas. While Johnny relishes the opportunity to be different, powerful and useful for once in his life, Sue and Ben are not quite so sanguine and participate insofar as there remains a possibility that the Government's research on them would yield some way of reversing their abnormalities. In the meantime, Reed has vanished off the grid, while Victor is presumed dead on the planet they had landed up on in the other dimension. One senses a conscious decision on the part of Trank to eschew the usual superheroics seen in the recent profusion of Marvel and to a lesser extent DC comic book adaptations, but the middle act drags precisely because Trank never quite finds a compelling substitute. Johnny's potential conflict with Sue and Ben over the Government's exploitation of their super-powers never amounts to anything more than a playground squabble. The estrangement between Johnny and his father (Reg E. Cathey), whose Baxter Institute had overseen the ill- fated project, is under-cooked. And last but not least, Reed's guilt over his teammates' fates as well as his strained friendship with Ben seem to vanish as quickly as he is apprehended and brought back to the facility to aid them in version 2.0 of the same project. Trank's intention of emphasising the tension within the quartet is evident and admirable, but is ultimately undone by a script that doesn't develop it in any substantive manner. Worse still, it leaves an audience looking for visual spectacle severely wanting, that not even a very busy third act manages to salvage. Doom makes an unsurprising return here as their common enemy, driven by a fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet Earth becomes a rallying call for the team to unite despite their differences. It is one of the dullest and most unexciting finales we've seen in a Marvel movie, not least for the fact that it doesn't know how to collectively bring together their superpowers except in a tag-team fashion to distract their opponent.  It is also on the whole one of the ugliest comic book movies we've ever seen. The planet from which the quartet gain their powers is a barren rocky wasteland that has no character or distinction whatsoever, shrouded perpetually with thick grey clouds and given the even more nondescript name of 'Zero'. The energy that gives them their abilities appears as some slimy green goo that belongs entirely in a C-grade Syfy TV movie, while their powers ‚Äì whether Reed's rubber limbs or Sue's telekinesis or Johnny's pyrotechnics or Ben's rock-covered body ‚Äì look equally cheesy. It is no wonder too that the eventual showdown, which takes place almost entirely on the planet surface of 'Zero', doesn't play out any much better against such a bland setting, coming off even worse than any of the action scenes in its predecessors. And certainly, this reboot is in no way better than Tim Story's earlier adaptations, no matter of its ambition of being a darker and more character-driven superhero piece. 'Chronicle' may have been a perfect calling card for Trank, but 'Fantastic Four' shows a young, inexperienced director completely out of his depth, absolutely justifying the advance bad buzz it had spent months battling. It is utterly embarrassing that a film about Marvel's most enduring creations is no better than a live-action 'Power Rangers' movie, but that's exactly the ignominy that this misconceived and badly executed excuse of a superhero movie has wrought. As is typical with such origin stories, this one ends with the quartet 'stumbling' on their title as they admire their new home in Central City and reflecting on how far they have come. Ben aka the Thing describes their journey as "fantastic"; we're not entirely sure anyone of their audience shares the same sentiment.Worse than it's predecessors I'm honestly not surprised one bit that I didn't enjoy this movie.The trailer was awful,and it was obvious the movie was only made for Fox to keep the rights to this piece of garbage. The main problem with this movie is that it tries so hard to be dark and gritty.The movie isn't gritty at all.Dark?Yes at some points,but not in a good way. Another problem with this abomination is it's pace.Oh my god,the pace of this movie is incredibly slow.I'm in disbelief I didn't fall asleep.Honestly,the films pace is so slow,it's hard to know what's going on at times due to how bored you are. Next is the acting.While I though young Miles Teller did decent,the other actors were awful.I honestly feel everyone,especially Kate Mara,was miscast.It seems to me as if every actor was bored,but hey so was the audience! Another problem is the villain.I don't have much to say about Doom,besides the fact that he was forced into the film for the sake of having a villain.He wasn't threatening for even a second;He was just a joke,like the film itself. Lastly,the film is a set up for films to come.It's obvious it is,so Fox can keep the rights.From rumors out there,it's trying to set up sequels,which is true,and it's trying to set itself up with the X-Men Franchise,which I hope not. Overall,the film was an atrocity,just like it's predecessors,and the only good thing was probably the CGI.Then again,it wasn't even that amazing.The CGI wasn't as good,as say,'The Amazing Spider-Man 2'or 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. My rating is a 2/10,and it'd be a 1/10 if the CGI was a tad bit worse.Too dark for its own good I went into this movie with hope and optimism and not put off by the negative light shone towards it. An hour and 40 minutes later, I left feeling empty and unsatisfied. Comic book films are supposed to make you feel inspired, but not this one.  So what is wrong with it? One word ‚Äì chemistry. In any superhero team/ensemble there should be great character interactions and a feeling that these guys can effectively make a team, never mind a ''fantastic'' team. The best team movies all have characters playing off each other as in the Avengers and X-Men. ¬†However, there is zero chemistry between any of the F4. We see an attempt at some early romance between Reed and Sue which doesn't go anywhere. Johnny Storm is billed as a genius but troubled kid however we never see why he has a high IQ, he is just shifted in to make up the numbers. We never see him form any sustainable bond with any of the others. Ben Grimm also appears as an outsider, brought in with little sense to the project to fill the final slot. The chemistry between the original F4 (2005) was MUCH better whereas here they feel like 4 individuals.  ¬† The climatic battle takes place in the most boring environment that you can imagine. It is over within 10 minutes, with not much ingenuity to overcome a half decent attempt at Dr Doom, who at first seems very intimidating. This film will be quickly forgotten and the question isn't whether a sequel will be made or whether it will cross over with X-Men, but is the original Fantastic 4 film a better watch than this depressing, dull comic book movie. Final score 5.5/10So easy to Review I would like to start by saying no. Just no. Oh my gods No! Josh Trank, I assume your name is short for 'Tranquilizer', yes? I cannot think of a single thing that can save this film. Kate Mara, you are gorgeous and a wonderful actress and I admire your work and, most importantly, I hope this willfully awful thing has not destroyed your career. So: Script = No. Direction = No. Characters = No (which is odd, because the Fantastic Four are great characters, and yet you have managed to get a 'no' with them. Remarkable!). Miles Teller = No. Josh Trank = No. Even for cereal commercials, no. Recast the original Fantastic 4 movie and reboot THAT. What you have done is bad. I'm stunned. This was worse than Batman &amp; Superman vs Storytelling, and you can read my review on that travesty on IMDb to learn just how badly you have done!A strong cast and an effective first two acts brought down by a rushed, half-hearted ending. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie at all. I was a huge skeptic when the first trailer came out thinking it would be another FF movie chock full of cheesy one-liners and cartoony humor. In that respect, I was way off. Josh Trank's Fantastic Four is grounded in relative realism, showing what would likely happen if people did in fact crack inter-dimensional travel and brought back superpowers. It has a darker tone than the other movies and is a wildly different experience because of it. The characters are more relatable, their situations are more believable, and for a good part of the movie, it actually feels like you're watching the true Fantastic Four origin story unfold. I can't blame Trank for the discrepancies I have with the movie because he is not at fault. Apparently the producers demanded reshoots which rear their ugly head about 20 minutes from the end. It turns from this relatively dark, stylish superhero drama to an overblown one-liner infested CGI-fest. Mind you, I was still pulling for the heroes the entire time, but the moments following, preceding and including the final confrontation are so forcefully rushed and haphazardly put together it completely disconnects you from what the first hour of the movie set-up. The climax is generic and lackluster, and the believable shaky chemistry the characters shared in the beginning of the movie becomes incredibly forced and awkward. The shift is so drastic it's as if they Frankenstein'd two separate movies together, making for one extremely disjointed watching experience. Miles Teller and the rest of the cast have the benefit of being immensely likable. They worked well together and had palpable chemistry for a good chunk of the movie. Even Doom was fine. Once I got past the fact that it wasn't the comic book's adaptation of "Doctor Doom" and took him at face value as a sci-fi villain, I thought he worked wonders and actually posed a genuine threat to humanity. The CGI as a whole is great - a few moments will leave you scratching your head as in "was that really necessary?" but for the most part, the alternate dimension looks fantastic and the few fight scenes there are (literally only two or three) are executed well. Again, these are simply hints of what the movie could've been. It's obvious Trank had a vision with this world, and it's a damn shame that we won't be able to see it in full effect. What we're left with is a promising set-up and a complete mess of a third act with potential bleeding out right up until the final frames. Fantastic Four is more realistic and immersive than the other two adaptations, but unfortunately not as fun as either. What we're left with is an exercise in "what could have been" and another superhero movie with promising aspects that simply did not click.I liked it, but I can see why others didn't Fantastic Four is not your average superhero movie by today's standards. It's dark, low-key, and unexpected. I almost passed on watching this, since everyone seemed to have hated it. I'm glad I gave it a shot anyway. I'd like to borrow a quote from another reviewer here that expresses quite accurately why this movie didn't do well (even though the review was intended to be negative): "Fantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all." That about sums it up. Superhero audiences were expecting something similar to recent superhero offerings, and they didn't get it. For myself, being generally not terribly impressed with most recent superhero movies, I had a somewhat different reaction. There have been a couple standouts, like Batman Begins and Iron Man, but on the whole most seem like forgettable, disposable eye candy.  If taken as a standalone flick, independent of any expectation, this is a decent movie. It's for the most part well-paced, well-acted, the effects are convincing without being overdone, and it's even well-written, for the most part.  What it is not, is "big". And people were expecting big, of course. Rather than its characters shown becoming celebrities with the world watching, the press eating them up, and displaying spectacles for the public that destroy city property, these kids spin a rather "small" tale that occurs primarily in secret. I give this a seven out of ten, but threw in an extra star to offset (just a little bit) the unfair slap this movie got due to viewer tastes being, I feel, ruined by bloated Hollywood treatment of recent superhero adaptations.Now This Is Some High Quality Crap!!!! It is almost impossible to imagine that in 2015, as movie audiences experience the golden age of superhero movies that there can still be crap like this. Somehow, someway Fant4stic reaches into the depths of awful superhero movies, and takes the crown for being one of the worst superhero movies of all time. Lets start with the lack of story or even a simple plot. For starters, we really aren't even introduced to some resemblance of a plot until an hour into the movie, and even then the plot essentially boils down to Doom sucking a hole out of the earth to somehow build his own planet, which is completely bare. Considering that synopsis, I think it is almost safe to say that this movie doesn't even have a plot (or one that at least makes sense). OK so the movie doesn't have a "genuine" plot, that been the case with some other superhero movies. It should at least have some cool action scenes or provide some worthwhile visuals. Nope! I honestly can only recall maybe five minutes of some actual "action"' and even that was happening, it was absolute crap. There were multiple opportunities throughout the film to showcase their powers, especially in the scene with Reed Richards and Ben Grimm, but instead, all we are left with is crappy one-liners. Even in the last 10 minutes when we get the big battle, it ends up being a boring, uneventful, clich√©, and yes crappy letdown. So we've got no story, no action, no villain (I won't even waste my time with Dr. Dumb), how about some witty dialogue or a couple of humorous scenes. Wrong again. In its attempt to be the Dark Knight of FOX superhero movies, Fant4stic is stripped of all the humor and campiness that at least made the earlier Fantastic Four movies watchable. Instead, we get a dark and surprisingly depressing film that doesn't evoke any sense of emotion from the viewer except for boredom. The jokes are laughable (except there not) and just about all the interaction between characters feels forced and inauthentic. OK. So by now you get the idea. Fant4stic is an absolute crap-shoot of a movie. A movie void of a plot, action, and OK dialogue doesn't even deserve to be called by its name, hence the Fant4stic's. It makes the earlier Fantastic Four movies look like The Avengers, and in the end, serves as an embarrassment to anyone associated with the film. And if you were wondering, yes, it is even worse than Batman &amp; Robin. :0Fantastic Four(2015) Review Fantastic Four(2015) Starring: Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell, Toby Kebbell, Tim Blake Nelson, Reg E. Cathey, Chet Hanks, and Tim Heidecker Directed By: Josh Trank Review CHANGE IS COMING. When I was a little boy around the time when I saw Spider- Man the movie from 2002 I also watched the 90s cartoon of Spider-Man on Jetex. Along with two other Marvel properties The Incredible Hulk cartoon and Fantastic Four. I was a big fan of that show I haven't seen it in a long time. But when they made the 2005 movie and I saw the trailer on the official website of the movie I got excited, saw the movie and I loved it as a kid and I still do. The sequel however the only good thing I could say for it at the time was Laurence Fishburne. I mean I know it was kind of hard to make a fantastic four movie with Galactus but ugh I just couldn't fathom what they did to him. Comic book movies are booming these days and it's a damn shame that this is the most recent entire to Marvel's first family. I like the 2005 movie but it's doesn't feel as Fantastic as the cartoon did. I have three perfect Spider-Man movies, I have five perfect Batman movie, I have four perfect Superman movies, I have three perfect X- Men movies, I have at least one perfect Hulk movie. But not one for Marvel's first family. What the hell?! Four young outsiders teleport to a dangerous universe, which alters their physical form in shocking ways. Their lives irrevocably upended, the team must learn to harness their daunting new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy. They use their origins from the Ultimate line of comics and you know something Kate Mara was actually going to read the comics to learn about her character but a FOX executive said "No don't worry where going to use only the origin from the ultimate line, not any of the character aspect" yeah actors who want to be in comic book movies if a studio executive says that to you get out of the project because they're not like Kevin Feige where they are a walking encyclopedia on Marvel or a person who gives a crap about the movie, if they don't care why should you. In this movie their is a scene where Reed Richards one of the smartest minds in the Marvel universe who while may take an obsession in his work abandons Ben, Sue, and Johnny in the facility where they are being kept. Reed would never do that especially to Sue or Ben! Victor Von Doom one of Marvels most feared and powerful villains looks like absolute crap! His character is absolutely horrible as well he's an emo punk who's a stalker for Sue. But the thing that really grinds about this movie is the one thing that they had in the Tim Story movies they completely ignored in this film, do you want to know what makes the Fantastic Four standout in the Marvel universe aside from their villains, forget their villains for a minute, the most important thing they forgot about the fantastic four is............. THEY ARE A FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SCREW THIS MOVIE,IT IS THE WORST COMIC BOOK MOVIE AND ADAPTION I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!!!!'Fantastic Four': The Movie Where Nothing Happens! 'Fantastic Four' has always been a fun comic book. Ever since the early 60s, these four heroes have entertained us in each crime fighting, earth saving, and alien destroying issue. With Reed Richards, Johnny and Sue Storm, and Ben Grimm, there was nothing that these four couldn't handle. One of my favorite story arcs was from the mid-2000's where Ultimate Fantastic Four had to deal with zombies. It was an excellent storyline, one that I wish will be told on the big screen at some point. Speaking of the big screen, the Fantastic Four have never seen a good adaptation. There was a movie in 1994 made by Roger Corman (king of the B-Movies), which was never released. It was only made to secure rights for a friend, and is stuff of pure cinema legend and sought out by cult film fanatics. If you've seen any YouTube clips of it, you know it's terrible. Let's fast forward to 2005, where the guy who made the 'Barbershop' movies was given the opportunity to make a 'Fantastic Four' movie. If you can recall it, you'd remember it was awful and that Jessica Alba was really the only memorable thing from the movies, or at least the most talked about. 'Fantastic Four' is one of those Marvel properties that has yet to be turned over to Marvel itself, and is still owned by 20th Century Fox, which is unfortunate, because that studio still has no clue what it's doing with this franchise. That brings us up to date with 2015's 'Fantastic Four', which is a movie where nothing happens for 100 minutes. The studio hired Josh Trank to direct the film. Trank's only other credit was the "found footage" superhero film 'Chronicle' which had its good moments, but supposedly Trank is very difficult to work with, which is why he was booted off the upcoming 'Star Wars' film. Whatever good 'Chronicle' had going for it is non-existent here with 'Fantastic Four' and seems like it's one long set up for something yet to come. Over 95% of the film takes place inside a science lab where we see Reed Richards (Miles Teller) , Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) building a teleportation device and typing fast on a computer rather than using any powers or participating in an action sequence of any kind. Then there is Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), who of course is Dr. Doom and is evil for really no real reason. Maybe he's angry because his name is Victor Von Doom. It's never really explained. For a movie that is really 100 minute of an origin story that is supposed to run deep with character development, we really learned nothing about any of the characters at all other than that Sue loves to listen to her iPod, Reed can type fast on a computer, Johnny likes to race 90's rice rockets, and that Grimm may or may not enjoy his new rock body. That is literally the character's story arcs. Sure they come together and travel thru their teleportation device to another dimension after one of the monkeys from 'Dawn of the Plant of the Apes' does, but that's about it. It's not until the final 45 seconds of the film where we see some fraction of a team forming. I get that this is the start of something new and a big origin set up for future films, but there has to be something at stake here and some sort of conflict. Unfortunately, there isn't, other than at the end of the movie, there is a small crater in a rural area.The only good moment of the film was seeing Dr. Doom show his sadistic and violent powers, but it was over way too quick and was met with some bad directing. Then there is a the issue of the script, which is just terrible. I've seen better dialogue the 'Sharknado' films than I did here with 'Fantastic Four'. Most of the movie is just someone shouting what's happening on screen and what they should do to fix it. It was cringe worthy, complete with Ben Grimm yelling his actions as he's executing it in full on Thing mode. This is a shame too, because there are some very talented actors here who aren't given anything good to work with. My advice is to wait a few more years until Fox gives up the rights to Marvel so that we get a real origin story to this great superhero team. AVOID THIS MOVIE!If you like the comics or good story telling don't watch this movie One thing I loved about the comic is the relationship they have with each other. Especially the back and forth between the Thing and Human Torch but there is no team interaction in this film whatsoever. On top of that Sue Storm isn't even with the group when they get their powers! In a time when technology is getting better and it's getting harder to tell when something is computer generated or not how does a blockbuster such as this get away with bad CG. Fant4stic could have addressed all of the previous complaints and would have still emerged as a pretty bad movie; above everything else, the biggest problem with the film is its story. Not just that it's poorly conceived and not fleshed out at all, but that it's told in such a lazy, haphazard way. There's the usual protracted pre-transformation set-up that's been mandatory since Batman Begins, which runs for the first half of the movie and falls flat thanks to the poorly written characters. Then bright lights happen, powers are given, heroes are captured and¬Ö we jump forward a year inexplicably. OK, so things are going to look at how they've changed in that time, right? Nope. All of a sudden the third act motivation ‚Äì heralded by the return of Doom ‚Äì appears out of nowhere and we're into a rushed final sequence where the heroes' first attempt to stop the destruction of Earth actually works. THE END. That's it. That is the most measured way to present Fant4stic's narrative. I'd say it was written for an audience with a severely short attention span, constantly mixing up the status quo just to make things appear vaguely interesting, but the short run time suggests key development points were actually edited out, leading to such incredibly choppy pacing. Again ‚Äì an explanation, not an excuse. Fant4stic is barely a movie. It's a bunch of vaguely connected moments cobbled together to 100 minutes so it can qualify for a cinematic release; the idea there's a coherent narrative with a flowing story between its vaguely defined beginning and end is so contentious it's insulting.Give the rights back to Marvel Fox, give the rights back to Marvel, and lets pretend this movie just never happened.  Bad script   Bad acting   Bad characterization    Bad Doctor Doom   Bad action   Bad effects   Badly boring   Bad Fox Studios  This movie sucked so bad that I didn't even bother finishing it. Give me a break Fox, you can do better and we deserve it, because this makes two failed attempts now, and a third would just make the F4's chances of ever getting a good movie even worse. Give the rights back to Marvel.  Yours sincerely  A person with a brain and eyesUnfaithful to the original comic book. The movie industry is making mistake after mistake. It started with the first Spiderman movie. Parker gets unmasked apparently just to selfishly show the actor's face. So they sacrifice the secret that only the audience or reader was supposed to know. His true identity! Then they really went off the deep end in Fantastic Four 2015. Trank was apparently PROUD he didn't follow the original comic book. For the next FF, I think it would be good if they made the entire cast black. They could also have Sue and Johnny have an incestuous relationship while making Reed and Ben gay. I'm sure that would pack 'em in! I seriously doubt I'll bother to go see another superhero movie. And I grew up with those comics. I used to get a kick out of them. But they've taken political correctness to the Nth degree and I'm not going to pay another dime to see any again.  This review probably won't pass the political correctness test, but that's OK. Then the industry doesn't find out about their mistakes until they go belly up. They deserve to be out of business for cranking out this kind of trash.Quite pitiful I read somewhere that this version of FANTASTIC FOUR - coming hot on the heels of the two instalments from the 2000s - was only made so that 20th Century Fox could keep the rights to the franchise. Whatever the reason for its existence, this turns out to be a real dud of a movie, a movie by turns dull and deeply embarrassing. A fresh new cast of actors take up the main roles, and three of them are very good, but not so here. Kate Mara has so little to do that she seems bored by it all, while Jamie Bell has even less screen time. Toby Kebbell is a fine actor (just watch DEAD MAN'S SHOES if you don't believe me) but wasted as another stock bad guy. This long-winded origin story goes on and on and on with boring experiments in a laboratory for nearly all of the running time, until the last half an hour which packs in the over the top CGI effects and explosions. It's mindless, childish, and the complete opposite of what Marvel are managing to do with their Avengers franchise at the moment.Oh dear. You can't make up for a poor plot with special effects. I saw this on TV and after 40 minutes I was thinking "this is slow to get going", after an hour I thought it would surely improve soon, after 90 minutes I realized I'd just wasted 90 minutes of my life but I still kept watching... Rubbish plot, poor dialogue, so-so acting. Best avoided.Wait, that's it? This movie may have confused me more than any movie ever has before. It's not awful, in the beginning. The introductions are informative but not overdone. Comedy is existent and has a good tone. It's not full of puns and crap like "language!" that you get in the MCU. Yet then the pace is about to pick up and...it doesn't. But wait, later in the movie the pace is setting itself up for liftoff and...the movie is over. It feels like the audience spends the entire movie waiting for the movie to start. This is disappointing because it had a lot of promise starting out and never lived up to it.A nice film but not amazing The film is a reboot with a completely different but interesting storyline. The problem with this film is that there is little action in fact the film is based more on the completion of the project of the protagonists than the fight. Another problem is the duration of only 20 minutes of the bad in fact the scene of the "Final Battle" lasts very little and many important characters have made them become secondary as "The Thing".WOW!!!!!! This was the most exciting I have watched this year. After the movie I felt both happy and sad.When I came home I relised what a shitty movie this was. I later wanted my money back but they instead threatened me to force me to watch Fantastic four :rise of the silver surfer. So I did what they forced me to and now I feel really bad. Dont watch this movie it sucks. I loved everything about this movie. All from the special effects to the structure of the movie. The best part of the movie was the final fight. I hope that this will get a sequel. I also loved the villain, DR. Doom is fantastic. It's Fant4stic. But it sucks.Definitely the worst non-MCU Marvel film made, possibly one of the worst ever I won't even get into the backstage fighting and lead actor issues.. that's been reported to death. This "film" suffers from the need to hurry and make a film to retain the license and a lack of care of the quality by Fox. The only redeeming quality is some of the visuals but sadly the story, tone, pacing, acting (aside from Michael B Jordan who always gives his all even when the movie is terrible) kill any chance of this film being taken seriously. The massive and obvious reshoots as well as the story that appears to have been written from a brief browse of Marvel's First Family's Wiki and you have a recipe for disaster. Sadly Josh Trank will be blamed when editing, studio, rights holders, and speed are much more responsible for making this movie into the mess it is.Fantastic Four was okay but did not deliver the way we wanted it to. When I was watching Fantastic Four I was so excited but until when it came to the first half of the movie I was a bit bored because I already know what happens. So I just wanted to get to the part of the Fantastic Four crew using their powers, fight enemies with it, and get to Doctor Doom. But anyways the movie was not what I was expecting it was just a whole movie of them talking and nothing else. The only good things about the movie was the Casting Choices, Special Effects, Doctor Doom, the fight scene, Human Torch and that's pretty much it. But for the bad things about the movie was that it felt extremely slow and the story was just a repeated origin story of the Fantastic Four. So overall I give this movie a 6 because I don't know what to think about the movie besides of me being so confused about it.Give it back to Marvel; we don't need a fifth attempt The fantastic four are, an interesting group of superheroes, and it's just a shame that they could never get the Guardians of the Galaxy treatment like they should have; the 2005 film being the closest thing we'll ever get. I know that Fox has to adapt a film from the fantastic four (like the X- Men) ever 10 years or so to keep the rights to the characters, and the end result we have for this movie just proves the desperation. I've also heard a lot of controversy and problems that director Josh Trank had with the studio and vice versa. So anyway, the story. As a kid, Reed Richards discovers a way to create interdimensional travel, and after many years, succeeds. Discovering his potential, Dr. Franklin Storm offers him a scholarship, putting him together with his daughter Susan Storm and fellow young scientist Victor von Doom, to harness this new discovery. We meet Dr. Storm's son Johnny Storm, as well as Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm. One night, these young scientists embark on a mission of their own. But after something goes horribly wrong, they discover they have been given superhuman abilities. It's up to them to master their new abilities, and defeat a final threat that's a blast from the past. That's about it; the story is clunky as all hell. Dialogue is fine, actings OK, definitely not their A game. I do like Miles Teller as Reed Richards, but honestly I thought Ioan Gruffudd in the 2005 film fit the character perfectly. Kate Mara is fine as Sue Storm, and I liked Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, but even then I don't think any of the FF movies had the definitive portrayal. I actually liked Michael B. Jordan. As the portrayals go he does showcase the kinda immature, bratty, hot headed personality Johnny is meant to have, and can have his more serious moments. The CGI is fine and I liked that we had an actual CGI Thing this time around. Looks great. The visuals are interesting to look at and the music wasn't distracting or painful to listen to. That being said this movie was just a mess. The story dragged on and by this point. Treat it how you'd treat a future Batman movie, or a Spider-Man movies; ditch the origin story, we know how they become the Fantastic Four. And if you do have to put one in, don't put us through it over half way through the film. The villain is bye the numbers, spewing the same worthless garbage we were given Batman v Superman from Lex, and he's a throwaway villain; the worst part being he's meant to be DR. DOOM! Four times, they've used him in these adaptations and they've failed. Everything about the look of the film is just bland. I guess Trank was going for the Christopher Nolan "dark and edgy" tone but does he have to make it look depressing too? As for Josh Trank and the studio, I'll address the studio first. I don't know what was going through their heads, cause it just feels like they made this to either just keep the rights, or make a quick buck, or both. And if that was the case, why not just hire some low key director instead of Trank? Last time I checked, Chronicle wasn't successful because he was getting beaten to a pulp with mandates and studio interference; it was successful because he was able to have creative control. No one thought the first Iron Man would be a success, but because they gave Favreau creative control, it turned into one. I could tell almost near the end this was crapped out into theaters simply to keep the rights; they knew they messed up. If Fox can't just trust creative directors with their properties, then don't hire them in the first place; just get Brett Ratner instead. I don't know exactly what Fox is even doing with the Fantastic Four rights these days. If they're keeping them simply to make a quick buck every ten years then whatever, I'd expect nothing less. But if they have the intention on making an interesting film, with "heart, and passion, and breathtaking" moments, they've screwed the pooch far to many times now. I'm giving Fant4Stic a 4 out of 10. I just hope the next Fantastic Four movie has the words MCU plastered on top. And yes, I've heard about the new idea for the FF, about them as kids or something. Not a fan and it comes off as desperate to me.Not as bad as I thought it would be OK, it's not perfect at all, it has some really poor editing, some clunky dialogue and plot holes that gape wide open. However, the characters were fun, I enjoyed the use of youth over the "rich scientist" line from the earlier movies. It was really a DIY low tech fantastic four with true angst and almost dare I say it, believable to the performances. Dr Doom was poorly executed but was in line with the relative powers of the 4. So it stepped a long way from the spandex clad comic characters but to be honest that isn't a bad thing at all for me. Some great moments, I loved the Thing who really looked alive and rocky rather than orange and rubbery. The ending wasn't as explosive as other super hero movies but again, is that a bad thing ? does it always have to be a massive climax? So on the whole it worked as a fun 90 minutes, it wasn't the disaster many claim it to be as a movie anywayIt is not as bad as every one says it is Okay, when this movie released in the cinema at Star City me and my dad went to see this movie together and we both loved it. It had good special effects and acting. However, Jamie Bell was good as Ben Grimm but was a miscast as The Thing whereas Micheal B Jordan was a miscast as both Johnny Storm and the human torch. But at least Sue Storm was more cute and hotter in this movie than the previous incarnation. But really bugs me is in this version Ben Grimm, Reed Richards, Johnny Storm and Victor Van Doom went into space and got effected with Victor left behind. But Sue got affected when the spaceship landed and created a shock wave and she fainted despite the fact she never went with them.  But it was a very awesome movie but not the same as the previous incarnation and don't let these bad reviews that are written by comic book nerds, fanboys and fangirls stop you from watching this film.Why did they reboot this? I know at this point it is like flogging a dead horse but this movie is all kinds of terrible. I really did not want to watch this film in the cinema so waited for it to be available on Netflix and thank god I didn't waste ¬£8 on a movie ticket. I only wasted 1 hour and 39 minutes of my life which is much more expendable. Anyway let's get down to the meat and potatoes of this film then. The film starts off really poorly with the worst scene in this film. The school career day scene that makes no sense!! Reed Richards stands at the front of the class and says that he wants to be the first person to invent teleportation. For some reason this really angers his teacher who starts berating him in front of his class (who all look to be different ages and sitting in the exact same position at their desks for some reason). This is something a teacher would never do in a class room and this scene sets the movie up for more fails.  The plot is very BORING with nothing exciting happening for 2/3 of the film! In a superhero movie you want the powers to be gained in the first 1/4 not have to sit through 50 minutes of filler until we get to something. The film feels it has to explain everything before we get to the action of the film which is at the far back end of the movie. The plot pacing is all over the place with scenes being rushed forward at inconvenient times to make way for some of the worst character development I have ever seen. The characters in this film have no development what so ever. No one learns anything, the four of them do not even become a proper team that work together and they have no real back and forth with each other. Ben Grimm is thrown into the mix when he is essentially written out of the plot half way through.  Sue storm is played by a terrible actress. Kate Mara's performance is flat and she only uses two facial expressions in the entire film (one of them whilst in her force bubble thing). What's more in this film sue storm is adopted and we are told that she is originally from Kosovo or some place? I mention this point because it has sweet FA to do with her characters story arc, her emotional blueprint or anything else. It was just a useless bit of info that we did not need to be explained. Miles Teller was great in whiplash but here he is not helped by a flat, BORING script which gives him nothing to work with and not much character background to feed off. As I said before there is not one single joke between the characters and everyone is so serious (WHY SO SERIOUS??). Even the human torch, who is supposed to be the comic relief, is flat and always seems to be angry at life for some reason. Honestly after watching this movie I sat back thinking that I should cancel my Netflix subscription, the film was that frustrating. The music, cinematography and all other technical things I look for were all lost as I was just distracted by how boring and nonsensical the plot was. I guess if the sound and colour were really bad it would have registered with me but the sound and colour are just like elevator music it just is so unimportant that you don't notice it.  Poor writing is what kills this movie for me. Nothing about this films plot is interesting or exciting but at least it doesn't fail on a technical aspect like suicide Squad. This is easily the worst Marvel movie of the 2010's so if I were you I'd give it a miss and watch Avengers instead.Not the F4 I know and love I feel sorry for the actors in this movie because they do their jobs well. It's just a shame the story line and characterisation has strayed so very far from the original comics. I much prefer the earlier movies which are much closer to the original comics and characters. I'm glad that plans for sequels seem to have been quashed! The worst part of the movie, for me, is when daddy Baxter propounds the possibility that the science that Reed and his friends are uncovering could be an answer to humanity's ills. The illusion that science will somehow fix all our woes (climate change the worst amongst them) is dangerous because it moves our focus away from the reality that we need to fix climate change by stopping using fossil fuels. This point may seem far from this movie, but actually Baxter's "science as saviour" lecture is central to the problem we face in NOT facing problems like climate change.No its not great, but doesn't deserve such a low rating. Let's start off by saying that because of it's low rating I have put off watching this until now. As it has just become available to stream on Netflix I thought that I would brave the inevitable disappointment. But I actually didn't think that it is as bad as the lead reviewers are stating in long winded waffles that any normal person only has limited patience to read. Lets cease with the ramblings of your own inflated self importance and try being concise! (A request I am going to no so ironically break)  NO clearly this does not match up to many of the other Marvel films that have been produced in the last ten or so years. I'm not going to hail it as so. BUT... I could see elements of they were trying to do and applaud the effort and refrain from condemning it as 4.4 rating. If M Night Shyamalan can continually make ever so increasingly abysmal offerings that all started with The awfully transparent The Sixth Sense. I fail to see the logic of this rating. I would stay this is far far better than the VAST majority of his films. In a world where Avatar, the worlds dullest amalgamation of tired and overtly mind numbing and stupidly stereotypical monstrosities apparently warrants multiple sequels. I fail to comprehend placing this title below a 5.Disappointing I was really looking forwards to watching this new Fantastic Four movie. I did not like the first movies mainly because of the bad casting. But now I can compare with this new one to realize they have taken this franchise up a notch in the bad movies scale. The casting for this movie is atrocious. Casting one of the smallest actors, Jamie Bell (and do not get me wrong, he is a fine actor but not for this role for Christ sake!) for one of the biggest characters in film history, the Thing... What is wrong with these people? And the Human Torch is now a black dude? It is not a racial thing but... Come on! You cannot change like this the main features of the story. The Doctor Doom character looks f*cking ridiculous, his face looks like a bald dorky puppet with funny eyes, not scary at all. Disappointing.Disappointing action movie From 1994, we had a rather cheesy and lackluster superhero movie. In 2005 and 2007, we had more intense yet better films. The first made in 2005 was kinda campy but the sequel was awesome. But in 2015, we have gotten a terrible one. It is even worse than the 1994 one and worse than the marvel movies that were lame. It is dark,boring,dull and totally wrong. This has bad acting, superhero action that is only in 9.9/10 of the movie, scenes that are like scenes in a horror movie, and a horrible Doctor Doom. This is easily has to be one of the worst superhero movies and one of the worst movies in 2015.They could have done so much with this movie As someone who tries giving movies the benefit of the doubt, this movie was, hard to do that with. When I saw the reboot was changing up the Storms backstories, I was interested in seeing the film. I think the casting of Michael B was a good choice and a nice change from Chris Evans Johnny we saw in the first movies and thought his acting was the best of the cast. Unfortunately, the other cast seemed very emotionless in most of their scenes to me. And nobody had any chemistry together. The whole Ben and Reed story they were trying to do could have been great if the actors had more chemistry and it didn't feel so, again, emotionless. One thing I will say I appreciate they tried doing is showing the struggle they had after just transforming and being locked up; but even then they rushed those scenes along with the rest of the movie.  The rushed fight against Victor made no sense because they did a terrible job building his relationship with the others unlike the previous installment.  I was lost by the story half of the time and I don't think that went away by the end either. It was rushed and all over the place, it makes me sad because they could have done so much with this movie, maybe with a better script and some of the cast replaced it could have been better than first movies (that I personality enjoyed).Not Deserving of the Hate I didn't expect much and wasn't overly excited to see this, but I thought the trailers made it look cool and I go for the dark, brooding style over the more colorful, hyper style of something like Avengers. Another caveat is that I'm not a comic book purist by any means. If you can stick to the source material and make it good, awesome. But I also fully believe that not everything good in comic form (or any written material) makes a good transfer to film, and even if it's good, some change can make it better. So they made the human torch dude black, or altered this or that event in the storyline. Big f'ing deal, you gd children. It's a comic book - chill. Take all that into consideration I guess when I tell you I'm absolutely stunned at the level of vitriol heaped upon this film. It wasn't great, sure. But I truly have never seen a movie more undeserving of it horrid reputation. Yes, the ending was rushed and you could tell that, yet again, a bunch of studio suits and hacks thought they could put together a film better than real filmmakers. I do believe that Trank's original vision would likely have been great, from what I've heard and from what made it on screen. Even with the studio butchery though, it was more than passably entertaining. Actors were all fine, effects were up to snuff - even the Thing. Story-wise it was the first in a presumed series, so yeah, you expect a lot of set-up - giving back stories, bringing the team together, etc. It's really too bad that there won't be a second. I think what you have here mostly is a case Asperger/Autistic/Borderline Personality Disorder obsessives that have freaked out because it didn't adhere to the source material to the letter, so they complain and then make up all kinds of other invalid reasons to hate it on top of that. I don't care enough to be bogged down by that kind of bs, so I enjoyed it.Absolute dreck This movie was painfully bad. The plot, the dialogue, the distorted origin stories: there was virtually nothing good about it. Extremely disappointing. I had hoped for at least a few redeeming bits. The CGI of the alien planet was kind of cool and there was a good but extremely brief scene of the group being sucked up into the air by the dimensional rift- but for 120 million dollars, that was the best they could do? what a waste of time and money!Awful. Just awful. Pretty much nothing about this movie was redeeming. The plot was completely unfathomable, the characters totally flat, acting was pathetic. And it destroyed anything good from the original storyline. Reed was in hiding for a year, and the other 3 became human weapons, enthusiastically?? Fox has never gotten the Fantastic Four, or Dr. Doom, right.Good but could have been better. I don't like most comic book movies and really like very few of them. I think most of them deviate far too much from the source material, but, its been apparent that's never going to change. So I am writing this review with that in mind. It was good, but, could have been easily been better. The effects were great, acting was good, but, Dr. Doom's backstory was a bit of a stretch and the movie ending was an ever bigger one. It would seem that the movie was either redone with a different ending or drastically shortened resulting in a hasty denouement.The pits I was simply amazed that with all the mass success of Marvel films in general that we actually got a film this awful. This is one of the most reviewed films by Internet critics ever created. I think at least eight people have taken a shot at this, even though some of them weren't technically episodes of their show. You knew the Nostalgia Critic would get to it eventually. So why is this film so horrible? It actually repeats a lot of mistakes the other ones did! It has Doctor Doom being jealous with Reed over Sue and the effects are still bad, especially with Reed's arms. The pacing in this film is among the worst I have ever seen in my life. We are so used to live-action superhero movies being two hours long, you know it would fail with this length. I think it's this length simply because 100 (minutes) is a very nice even number. Oh, this is the fourth Fantastic Four movie and still no good ones! It isn't until halfway through the entire movie that the characters get their superpowers. Even after that, it isn't until four fifths in the movie that we actually see the characters all together! I'm serious!  The constant use of darkness is so obnoxious. Why is the Thing naked? In fact, why do they not even use their superhero names until the very end? Even then, only half of them use their names. This film is so soulless with no humor at all as at least the other movies had some light hearted moments. The worst line is probably when Doom says, "There is no Victor. There is only Doom". Uh...Victor and Doom are the same person. Everything is horribly rushed in such a boring film. Well, this is the last film for Superhero Month and it's sad we ended on such a bad note. Hopefully, Anime Month will be better! *Wow This is already 4 movie about a fairly well-known team. The first came out in the early 90's turned out to be a cheap passing film which even on big screens was not allowed. Then, in the middle of the zero ones, another film was released, which was a rebut. Later released a sequel. In those days, I liked them. Having looked them over again, I realized that these are average, rather funny pictures. It's 2015 now. We were shown pretty steep trailers, gloomy, in the spirit of science fiction, looked good. And then the movie came out. Immediately, a barrage of negativity poured into him. Both from critics and from the audience. The film suffered a devastating failure, collecting a little more than its budget. At first I thought that this was again a through the grapevine, critics as always smell and so on. And I myself watched the movie. And all this criticism proved to be justified. The film is very weak. In all. Literally everything in him is bad. Now I will try to explain why this movie I think is bad. Usually the plot in such films is not in the first place. Usually blockbusters compensate with this action, humor, interesting characters. But there is nothing in this film. The effects themselves are very messy. Everything is done very cheaply. It would seem that the budget of 160 million dollars? Remember how a Thing tossed a tank, comments unnecessarily. The action in the film is almost nonexistent. He is in the finals, but he is poorly delivered and very short. The music is scarce. Sometimes it happens that a good soundtrack can make a movie floor. Well, at least give an epic and an atmosphere. Similar films I think should not be given, and so it is clear. Immediately the music is not remembered at all. The plot as I wrote is not particularly fashionable to criticize in such films, but still he is very trivial and smells of idiocy. I heard that the film was cut, changed, heard about the scandal. But we have what we have, there will not be a director's version. We have a very boring movie, with a stupid story line and a bad script. The tape is very boring. The actors played medium. The characters themselves do not develop at all. The script is so wretched that they decided to send the guys to another world because of drinking. The guys were just drunk. All. Here at last our heroes get beyond the ability. How do you think, what will happen next? A year later, a fantasy on the run, the rest help the military. That is, we do not show how the characters acquire the ability, how they live with it. It was just scored. The very nature of the characters are also strange. They do not develop at all. In this film there are a lot of dialogues, they are absolutely senseless. I do not want to say that this is the worst worst film in the world, but it's frankly very bad. And as a blockbuster, and as a regular film at times. But I still liked something. I liked the first 20 minutes of the film, this part is quite interesting. And then unfortunately went the pun that I wrote above.Boring and missing the point For the first half of the movie nothing really happens, then the four get their powers and Doom gets lost in the other dimension, then still nothing happens, then Doom casually kills everybody on the base, then there's the final showdown, and the movie ends. Rather boring, and I say that it really misses the point of a superhero movie.Liked it but It was cool and all, I have always loved super heroes since I was a little kid in the 70s reading most the comic books. I've been waiting decades for them to finally get around to making some of the movies they have today like the Avengers and soon Justice League, I of course wanted to see those on the big screen when I was little. But now that we're finally getting all these super hero movies I'm not complaining. I would've rather they made Fantastic Four part 3 instead of this one but I know how it goes most the time in Hollywood. Anyway I finally got around to watching this one a few days ago and I thought it was okay but it was a big let down. Basically another origin story and I did enjoy most of it until the big fight at the end. Very disappointed they have the big fight on the foreign planet and it really wasn't even that big of a fight. I think if the ending was done a little bit better I would've liked it even more. Regardless it was just kind of bland / plain. It really was nothing to get excited over and nothing to get upset over. It made me think of one of those kids you knew back in school who were there daily, they didn't talk much, you kind of saw them around but you really didn't know them.Not too bad - entertaining and realistic I was watching it at the fitness and thought I had already seen it (I saw the 2005 one) and was unsure if it is really a movie about Fantastic Four or another movie. I was waiting (for a long while) to see when they would get their powers and there were some mismatch from what I know about Fantastic Four in earlier movies. I remembered Reed being older and it didn't click to me immediately that Johnny is going to be different and Sue is not American? I thought the dialogue was a bit too simple. But past all that, I couldn't stop watching the movie (and stopped my workout instead). The simple scenes like Johnny and Reed's failed fist bump or Reed ignoring Victor's accusations of love in the office, show Reed's character. How the characters were feeling when the transformation took place were quite real. It wasn't something they would immediately embrace but need to go through some training. It was a fun and realistic movie. Though i didn't get to watch in the end, I definitely think it deserves more stars and would watch the sequel.One of the most boring, vapid and soulless super-hero films in a long time. 'Fantastic Four (2015)' is genuinely one of the most boring superhero films I've seen in a long time. This vapid and soulless studio affair feels like the product of several suited silhouettes and is indicative of everything wrong with both the genre and the studio system as a whole, as it totally encapsulates the phrase 'running out of steam' and was gutted of its entire middle portion. It seriously seems as though no-one involved could muster up more than a sigh's worth of enthusiasm, truly appearing as though the entire feature was only made so that Fox could keep hold of the rights to the franchise. The picture bizarrely has very little of the four actually doing anything fantastic until the underwhelming finale. The tone is so dour that even the quote unquote 'fun stuff' is bland and, frankly, a chore to watch, something that could also be said of the entire piece. 4/10Why would you watch this movie? This movie is really dumb. Its painful to watch and makes no sense. This thing is an abomination and shouldn't exist.I did give it time There was nothing Fantastic about this movie, not a second or a scene in which you can say "wow, now that was cool". I understand in the world of superhero movies disbelief is seriously suspended, but to spend over half the movie with the most boring backstory imaginable (not clever, not funny , kid gets slapped around, teacher is an ass, at least have some justice prevails moments). The very second Miles Teller's pathetically weak face appears there is no doubt that the rest of this movie is going to continue to suck cause there is no way that face is going to save it. Oooh, how interesting , looking at books in the library and awards in the hallway. I think the test monkey was more into his role than any of the rest of them, and with the back story given who would care about them anyway? Source material is there for a reason and the wheel need not be reinvented to attract some imaginary movie going genre. Tell a good story with characters people care about, add some humor that isn't stupid or just plain wrong (waterboarding in 4th dimension?) Bad military guys or are those corporate suits we're supposed to not like, who the hell knows or cares. Here kids, just sit up to these chairs and test this high tech equipment, no safety or supervision required....yay, it worked first time, fist bump, uh grab (actually mildly funny moment) Does Sue like Reed now? Who knows, who cares? Oh, and let's not forget to throw in a "it's clobberin' time " just for nostalgia's sake. Time for Fox to get out of the Marvel business and in 10 years or so perhaps revisit this and do it right (like DC and WonderWoman, it can be done with the right script, director and cast)There are many adjectives to describe Fantastic Four- unfortunately "fantastic" isn't one of them Despite being somebody who enjoys superhero films as much as the next person, this 'Fantastic Four' reboot has to be down there with one of the worst. The 2005 film and its sequel, both directed by Tim Story, were not great films (the former was somewhat mediocre, though the sequel was an improvement) but even with their faults they were much better than the reboot. Although it is often considered one of the worst superhero/comic book films ever made, this reviewer has yet to properly see the 1990s incarnation, but it does have to be irredeemably bad to be worse than this. Oddly enough, 'Fantastic Four' is not completely irredeemable. Michael B. Jordan is a cool, commanding and likable Johnny/Torch, and the only one in the cast who tries and succeeds to do something with the way the characters are written. It is ironic that the best thing about the film was the thing that was attracting the most negative publicity before release due to his race. Some of the film does look quite good, with slick photography, darkly atmospheric lighting and audacious production design. Not all of it comes off though. The editing is both sloppy and choppy, not only looking cheap but in particular severely affecting the storytelling. The special effects are at best perfunctory and some of them look pretty bad actually, much prefer the look of The Thing in the Tim Story-directed films here The Thing looks too much like a rock monster. Josh Trank clearly wasn't the right director for this, directing with little flair or involvement with the story. Then again he doesn't deserve all of the blame as most of the film's failures falls at the door of producer/studio interference. The music has some haunting parts but at best generic and not much stands out. 'Fantastic Four' has only one good performance, the rest are poor. Miles Teller and especially Kate Mara make Ioan Gruffodd and Jessica Alba look like Oscar-winners, Teller looks far too wooden and out of his depth as a leader and Mara is incredibly mechanical. Jamie Bell does try to stay true to Ben/The Thing's character, but the character is written far too one-dimensionally so Bell despite some glimpses as a whole fails to inject much tragedy or depth to him. The chemistry between them is almost non-existent and they just don't feel like a team. Toby Kebbell is an insipid and very non-threatening Victor Von Doom, here a villain practically shoe-horned into the story and basically a villain for the sake of being a villain with no obvious motivation or personality to speak of. In all fairness they do have a very clunky and by-the-numbers script, with some cheesy lines and too many stupid moments, to work with that has some neat ideas but barely does anything with them. There is too little action, and what there is of it is hugely underwhelming, very uninterestingly choreographed and no fun or tension, everything just feels indifferent. The biggest let down here in 'Fantastic Four' is the story which is a mess. Scenes that go on for too long, due to poorly written exposition that is barely elaborated upon (the father-son relationship could have injected some much needed heart to the film but goes nowhere), drag endlessly, and when something does happen if not by much the film rushes through it with some incompleteness here and there. The too short running time is to blame, the film should have been twenty minutes to half-an-hour longer. Particularly suffering is the far too busy third act and a very rushed (in length and to a lesser extent pace) and dramatically limp final battle, which doesn't really feel like much of a battle. All in all, fantastic is the last word to describe a very disappointing reboot. 2/10 Bethany CoxNot A True Marvel Movie No Stan Lee cameo and no extra scene in the trailer! Not to mention the movies just plain sucked. When was the last time a Marvel movie really sucked this much? The acting was horrible. The dialogue was even worse. The plot was just a re-hash of any other superhero movie (Thor: Dark World comes to mind). I mean they put no thought into the plot or the casting. They should have stuck with the original origin story and updated it for the times, like Iron Man. At least that was done somewhat right. Thank goodness I didn't pay to see this movie. Thank you Cineplex for all the Scene points! Hopefully there won't be a sequel!Positive Review The movie took a different direction than most marvel movies by being darker and weirder. There was a disconnect through the cast but it was understandable as most of them had a troubling past in the movie and this was the first time they were forced to work together. A lot of the comments for this movie are negative but they are comparing the story to old school fantastic four when the movie, from the beginning, clearly highlights that this movie takes place in a very modern place. Many of the negative criticism is about the movie not being funny enough i liked the new direction they took, it was freaky at times to watch the F4 being exploited. The movie wasn't catered to the critics or angry fanboy who were already furious that the movie was going to be based on the UF4 and that they were changing Johnny ethnicity. Ultimately only the audience can decide whether they liked the movie instead of relying on others to decide for them.There is no plot and nothing is remotely believable I wasn't expecting much. In fact, I was looking forward to a terrible movie. As someone who grew up on Mystery Science Theater I was looking forward to a total garbage movie, and boy did this deliver. The first thing that bothered me about this movie was that although it tossed around a lot of science terms thrown around, there wasn't even anything remotely believable about the science. It was like they didn't consult any actual scientists, but just wrote the scenes using a bunch of jargon in an attempt to sound cool. Then there is the choice to make the Fantastic Four high school kids. Who made that decision? There is no reason for them to be 18/19 years old. But the biggest problem is that the movie lacks a plot. It literally does not have a much of a story at all. All that happens is they get their powers, barely anything else. They have a brief clash with Doom, but that's it. There is no build up, there is not tension.  This movie is truly terrible.Two reasons this movie failed The movie started off well but declined so terribly midway and ended abruptly. I have two major negative points: *SPOILERS AHEAD* 1. There was only one big fight scene. Usually when heroes first attain their super abilities there is a 'practice' fight scene when the hero(es) exercise their powers and discovers strengths, weaknesses, limits, etc. and also struggle to function properly as a team. After the battle the team should bond and/or come to terms with their powers better. Then there should be a second fight scene when the heroes exhibit new confidence and strength as a whole. None of this happened in the movie. In fact there was very little bonding and character development fullstop. Yes there was a bit of struggle but any strife between characters was forgotten entirely by the end without much resolution. 2. Susan Storm's wig. Her hair seemed to change colour every scene and varied throughout the film from blond dyed hair to a wig. I have a huge problem with this not only because I found her wig(s) distracting but the fact that it was necessary for her character to have blond hair at all made me angry. The male characters in the film don't seem dependent on any physical features - black hair, red hair, tall, short, black, white - none of it seems to matter. But it is inconceivable to recreate a Susan Storm sans blond hair. It seems to me that producers think the audience simply won't be able to recognise her unless they paint her exactly as she was originally created... like as if female characters are never to be listened to or understood. They're just there to be looked at.Joke of a movie When i first heard of Fantastic 4 i was blown away. I thought this might be finally a movie that is actually watchable of the 2015s, but oh boy oh boy i was so wrong. Don't get me wrong, first fantastic 4 was a bless. It was really good, but this one is just a fantastic garbage x4 . There was no chemical between the characters. Oh wait, i'm wrong, there was a little chemistry, between the rock and the gum (if i call them by name it would be an insult to the original movie). The action took to long to build up, by the time something actually happens i was so bored and i was already almost an hour into the movie? I mean come on, let's be serious, which movie takes 70% of it's time just to introduce 2 characters and nothing else? Especially when i think it's an action movie, oh it was so boring and bad. The cgi wasn't that great, the stone guy was really bad, too much detailing, the young inventor was too young obviously and why the father had to die right at the end? Just why... it wasn't his fault after all but yea, let's kill it to add a bit of drama to a puppet movie. After all i say i thought that the stones should have been more involved in the movie, but no, it appears at the beginning and at the end... Well after all this horror movie (in a bad way) i will go and re-watch the older fantastic four, where Dr reed really looks like a scientist and not some looser teenager and where the fight between Ben and Johnny is really, not just 10 second like in this one.Worst superhero movie of the decade so far Even though this movie has been getting heat since before it came out, I was still planning to watch it for myself and form my own opinion. This morning before going to the theater, I saw the director Josh Trank was already blaming the studio for the crappy reviews the movie got. This is happening the very first day the movie is out. Even so, I decided to watch it anyways. The only thing similar to the comics is the name, and that there are 4 individuals that have powers. Reeds and Sue have no chemistry, and there's no sign of romance at all. Johnny and Ben only talk to each other the last minute of the movie, and it's the human torch who "cracks" a joke at the thing, that sounds mean spirited and not funny at all. Reed leaves his friends for a year, and becomes fugitive, and when they find him all is forgotten (by the military and the research founders) in less than a minute. Doom is presented to be almost omnipotent, and is taken down by four kids that have no fighting experience (except the thing) in 3 minutes. This movie makes no sense, the plot is flat and unoriginal, the cast is too young, and it feels more like the story of Reed Richards than that of the team. Sue's hair is something that should not distract me, but it did. You can tell which scenes were a re-shoot just by looking at her wig. Johnny is portrayed as a bad boy with daddy issues, not funny and almost mean spirited. Ben Grimm is the smallest of the four, even Sue. Reed is an introvert that can't lead his own life, let alone a team. I really wanted to like this movie, since I've read lots of comics in my time, and I always welcome a movie adaptation of the genre, but this movie tries really hard to be disliked, and it's the only thing that it's good at.Worst Marvel movie I've ever seen Let's be honest. This movie was by far the largest disappointment this year. The only thing that links the Fantastic 4 with reality, is that it gets a 4 out of 10 score. With clemency. Fox really screwed up with a franchise that had all the credentials to be really good. Everybody knows the Fantastic 4 and everybody wanted to see a reboot because the previous movie also sucked. This decade is a time that super hero films have a very large fan group and every movie is anticipated with enthusiasm. The latest installment of Fantastic 4 did everything wrong. Starting with the duration, 100' is way too short for a reboot. They probably had a very low budget, considering the fact that many of the trailer scenes were deleted from the final outcome. The heroes are presented with the minimum background given, they tell us almost nothing about their personality and they are immediately put together as a team at a very expensive government project without anyone knowing anything about them. The Doom villain is one of the most powerful bad guys in the Marvel Universe and they defeat him in a 5 minute battle. That being said and with those thoughts in mind, I left the theater very disappointed and suggested others not to bother watching the movie because its probably one of the worst they would have ever seen. Do not watch this film if you are a hero fan!If only the movie were as good as the shorts for it. I would like to find out how I get my money back and the 2 hours of my life that have disappeared. I've given many movies scores on IMDb from 9/10 to 2/10, but have never written a review before. My fellow IMDb readers, please save your money and your time. The best analogy I can give you to describe this movie is that you go to a steak restaurant and all you get to eat is boiled white rice. Did it fill the time you while you were there? Sure, it did, but it lacked any flavour, any taste and any enjoyment you thought you were going to get.  Go to your local streaming provider and re watch the originals, you'll be glad you did that instead of this!Promising Start is a means to an insulting end to Marvel hits After the last FF4, you would hope they could at least improve on this, especially with a good cast and Matthew Vaughan on board (after saving X-men), hopes were high. For the opening hour or so, all was looking good, the story was developing, a little bit of a wobble after they gained their powers, but the story picked up again and looked like it had a strong foundation to continue with.......then it crashed into a crescendo of diabolical storyline, acting and action, that was an insult to the viewers and cinema as a whole. It started so well, but felt like they for the last twenty minutes, they decided to test the theory that if you put infinite monkeys in a cage with typewriters, they would recreate Shakespeare......Instead they employed 20 monkeys, who proceeded to soil themselves, throw it at each other, but produced a plot ending, that would have embarrassed a straight to VHS 1980 B-movieFantastic Four (2015): The Ultimate Failure My Review of Fantastic Four (2015) Spoilers  I finished Fantastic Four (2015) online on Saturday and I don't know where to start with this movie or even know what the hell did I just watch when I saw. I'm just going to be frank on this with anyone that is reading this review. This movie is completely boring and terrible at the highest level possible. Its more boring then Ang Lee's Hulk movie back in 2003 and even that movie had a bit more action and better acting in then this movie does that FOX has released to the public. The whole time that you watch this movie it will keep wondering when will the action start and it doesn't start until 1 hours and 20 mins into the movie where a fight scene happens. It is the only one major fight scene in this poor excuse of a movie where it involves the Fantastic Four and Doom fighting each other which is just awful. The fight does not add anything in this movie at all. Though-out the whole movie nothing amazing happens. Most of the time characters just working around talking to each other and doing nothing interesting at all. The people acting in this movie just come across as if they're drugged and just bored with being in the movie. It makes Kristen Steward's acting in the Twilight movies look more life-like which is funny because she barely shows any form acting or emotion in any of her movies but that is a different story. The SFX are nothing special or awe inspiring like other successful comic book movies out there so don't go thinking that your mind will be blown away because it won't. The story is nothing special which makes it even more boring and dull to watch. The actors neither act or even look like the characters from the Fantastic Four. They have zero chemistry and don't even act like a family like they're suppose in the comic books. Dr. Doom is neither menacing or come across as a real threat as he is suppose to like in the comic books. Plus, he looks nothing Dr. Doom, he just look likes a green glowing crash dummy instead of Dr. Doom from the comic books. Worse, this movie also tries so hard to be like Nolan's Batman movie only for it to just fall flat on its face trying to do so. It tries to put in the dark, gloomy and realistic elements of Nolan's Batman movies but at the process of taking away the fun elements from the Fantastic Four comic books. What is worse is that the actors involved in the movie were told to not even read the comic books to become familiar with the role. Why is that? In the modern era of comic book movie, almost every movie actor has been told to read the comic books to understand the characters. Why did Fox and the director did the opposite and tell their cast to not read the comic books? It makes no sense at all. This whole movie was just a Fantastic Four In Name Only Movie. Nothing more and nothing less. I agree with the majority of fans, critics and movie-goers out there. FOX studios only made this movie to keep the Fantastic Four movie rights from Marvel Studios and now is blowing up in their faces big time! The movie on Rotten Tomates has a lower rating then Batman and Robin (1997) and that is suppose to be the worse comic book movie ever to be made. Funny thing is as terrible as Batman and Robin was I found it to be a more entertaining then this movie. At least I could laugh at how stupid Batman and Robin was but this movie just wants to put me to sleep. I had to push myself to finish watching this movie. This new Fantastic Four movie is in a league of its own when it comes to be a terrible comic book movie or just a movie in general. It will not be long before it becomes the worst comic book movie of all time. I honestly hope that the movie rights goes back to Marvel Studios because FOX cannot be trust with the franchise. They multiple chances to get it right and they have failed each time because they purposely wanted to ruin the franchise. FOX and Josh Trank (Director of Fantastic Four 2015) have only themselves to blame for this movie that is flopping badly for all the right reasons.  In conclusion, don't waste your money on this movie. Either see it for free or wait for it to be released at the 99 cent store. Don't torture yourself trying to spend money on it unless you want to cure yourself from insomnia but that is another story. This movie is just dull, boring and just totally lifeless movie. It offers nothing to the Fantastic Four franchise and it doesn't do it any justice at all. It is the ultimate failure as a comic book movie and it won't be long before people consider this movie as easily one of the many worse movies ever made. 1 out of 5 starsWhy was this movie released? While the last batch of the Fantastic Four was lack luster, this one was just plain awful. Plot - Rehash of every other F4 film. The Fantastic Four get powers (this time through a dimensional portal) and fight Doom. Doom is actually missing for most of the movie, and the climax isn't satisfying. In fact, Doom seems to be all-powerful at the beginning of the climax in HIS dimension... then The Thing punches him and he seems to lose any ability to defend himself. Really? I can't even figure out how all of these characters even got together. All of them are supposedly intelligent (except maybe Grimm) but nothing they do on screen makes any of them appear to be a genius. Sorry, it seems like all they did was engineer it and there's no real explanation to how they do it. Fine, that makes you smart... but they don't USE it in any intelligent way, just travel through it. Characters - The ONLY character that had any development and you might care about is Father Storm. 1. Reed - Supposedly intelligent but all of the intelligence is off-screen, simply working on the teleporter. Nothing that he does in interacting with the other characters or reacting to events convinces me that he's a genius. 2. Sue Storm - The fact that she's adopted doesn't really mean much or help the plot in anyway except to allow them to have a white female with a black father/son. 3. Johnny Storm - Not as much the smart ass/daredevil as previous incarnations. The first time we meet him, he's redlining and then crashing his car. Without some other basis to believe he's actually GOOD at racing, not a good start. Then throughout the movie, he doesn't do much in terms of action. 4. Grimm/Thing - Appears at the beginning to help Reed, but there's absolutely NO development of what he does, other than bring spare parts for Reed to use on his teleporter v1.0. And his brother uses the 'Clobberin time' line for almost no reason. He's also missing for about half of the movie, and the 'tension' they try to create between Reed and Grimm/Thing is just not believable. He headbutts Reed once (after Reed had just avoided a punch)... and then all seems to be forgiven. Really? This might be more due to the 1.5 hr runtime, maybe they planned to make the tension more interesting in an earlier release. We'll probably never know. After all of the good superhero movies we've had recently, this just makes no sense. Who green-lighted this garbage? They need to be fired. Thankfully it was only 1.5 hrs of my life I'll never get back and not the 2.5 hrs I wasted on Tomorrowland.Watch it on fast forward, get the visuals, skip the plot. The acting was fine, costumes good, but the story plot was laborious and horribly drawn out.. not to mention, just plain boring. Not worth writing more about it, it was truly a painful watch. It's best to multi-task while watching this movie.. IF you really have to watch it. Damn 10 line limit. Anyway, the characterisation was quite annoying. The corporates are so clich√©d in their typical greed and stupidity. I like Marvel stories, but this was a reboot that was avoidable. It was reeking of plot holes BTW.. /spoiler Taking the chimp out of the pod, without any quarantine, but going all suited up otherwise. Sigh. The overall jealously of Doom over Sue and Reed. Come on.I'm glad it was a flop. In my opinion,Sony needs to give MARVEL the movie rights back, stop making crappy films the fans hate. As for as the Fantastic Four Franchise, let Netflix have a run at this franchise because poor writing has killed this movie for the big screen. I don't think the world would except another reboot even if Marvel Studios was doing it. I would love to see what Netflix could do with this with a 10 hour season. As it becomes clear this movie is going to be one gigantic flop, lets hope the actors of this movie know it's not their fault and that it was doomed from the beginning. Finally SONY, learn a lesson here, we the fans are who you must please,if you are going to take the stories and characters we loved growing up and make them suck the end result will be undeniable.Not-so Fantastic 4 I wasn't expecting much from this film but due to being a big comic book fan and being a student in the film industry, I felt I had to see it myself and make my own opinion on it. I have never been a big fan of the Fantastic 4 but I have always loved Dr Doom. I personally feel that Dr Doom was too dark a character to be associated with Fantastic 4. This film was very dark compared to the previous instalments and I don't think it was the right approach to make. I feel that Dr Doom is such a dark character in the comics that the team and he don't really benefit each other in the cinematic world. Visual effects were average. Many people have complained about the appearance of The Thing but I personally quite like his new appearance even though it is completely CGI. However, Reed Richard's flexible and extendable arms look terrible. I thought that area would have improved after the same effects from the previous films were terrible as well.  I questioned the cast when I first discovered they were in it. I think Miles Teller is a brilliant actor but I don't think he was right for the role at all. I thought Kate Mara was a good choice and I would have probably cast her in that role if I made it myself. Michael Jordan was not right for Johnny Storm and as much as I like Jamie Bell, I kept thinking of Billy Elliott every time The Thing was on screen. Toby Kebbell was brilliant as Viktor Von Doom. He got his personality right in my eyes and was entertaining to watch. But as Dr Doom I felt he was just too boring. He didn't have the same attitude as he does as Viktor.  Overall, I think the story would have been brilliant had it been made to be publicised as a comic. However, film wise, it wasn't so. I did not like the fact Reed abandoned the team. In my views, Reed would never leave his friends for his own benefit. The famous 'Final Fight' in marvel is usually a big and memorable thing in superhero films. I felt the fight was too quick and not so memorable at all and it was too easy for the team to defeat Dr Doom. And then they copy the Age of Ultron ending quote. Just as Reed says "FANTASTIC-". I personally find this horrible to watch. I didn't like it at all in the Avengers and it was not good in this film. Overall I wouldn't say don't watch it, however you shouldn't expect much from it. If you want an honest and fair opinion of it just simply watch it yourself.Marvel-less I'll start off by saying that I'm a fan of both Marvel movies and comic books. When I first heard that there was going to be a reboot of The Fantastic 4 franchise I was happy to see how they could develop these Characters. Then I started reading the critical reviews and started to wonder what had gone wrong. There are lots of movies that get slated in top reviews and I love them, but was this going to be one of those movies? I'm afraid not. There is so much material they could have used to create an amazing movie, but they did so little with the writing and that's odd when you look at the fact that they credit a group of people as the writers? all they created was a movie that will need to be rebooted again by someone who can actually write a story. I'm sure the script for this movie would have gotten a failing grade from any English teacher worth their salt. I'll make this easy for people who are not sure. The movie takes 90 minutes to get to the credits. They must have been drooling about all the sequels they would be able to do in the future and forgot to actually write a plot, character development or even something as simple as cheeky banter? So, if you can watch it for free on TV you might be willing to waste that 90 minutes, but you'll hate yourself for doing it. don't say I didn't warn you.Awful This is my first review here. I had to write this because this is literally first time in my life that I wanted to leave out from cinema. I don't understand how Marvel allowed this movie to go out, after all those good movies lately. Story is bad, acting is like in teenage series, plot, is there plot in this movie at all? Why teenage actors? Half of movie is some kids rubbish, nothing is happening for hour and a half, nothing. And when something finally happens, you wish it didn't. Last two F4 movies are way better than this one, and I hope this will not have a sequel. You never feel anything except boredom while watching this. Not even effects are anything special. I hope director and producer will stop making movies after this one, they can go on Sy-Fy channel and make stuff like this, not for cinema.Come on, Fox. That's getting awkward. One of the most famous questions about Marvel Comics is answered in this movie: Is The Thing's "thing" made of rock? The answer is pretty anticlimactic, though. It's very fitting, also, regarding what has been done to the characters, both heroes and villain. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those expecting, even hoping, that this movie would suck. I had high hopes that it would work this time. Honestly, it goes decently until the third act. It seems like they made some last minute changes to appease the fans but it was too late. Doom isn't a blogger, nor is called Domashev. But that barely matters, since that character is less Doom than even the previous two movies. Pre- villain Victor Von Doom himself is a pretty nice guy, you can end up even sympathizing with him, but when Dr. Doom is revealed, is almost as if a switch is flipped where the director crumbles under the pressure and decides to rush things out of pettiness, delivering such a half-assed third act that ruins a movie that was OK until then, even with all the flaws. Right to the hot topic: Making Johnny and Sue stepbrothers DID ruined their relationship. It was so badly handed, that the two are barely registered as co-workers. It seems as if they decided that a black guy being overprotective over a white girl would sound too creepy. Another trait that was dumped from comics was Ben and Johnny constant bickering. Half the movie passes until Ben gets to interact with his future team members, and when we finally see Johnny annoying Ben, the movie is ending and feels forced, like something added at the last minute. Several scenes hint to something that'll be important or that'll happen afterwards, but they never pay off. It seems like they left a lot at the cutting room floor, specially because a lot of finished scenes from the trailers never even show up. I believe this time Fox finished ruining FF's chances at being a franchise the public will care about.Don't Judge because of the Reviews because its good. I hate how every one thinks this is bad because its not this film is far from perfect but its still great it has amazing chemistry from the cast and having such stars means they are really watchable, the origin wasn't boring and found it more interesting then the campiness' of 2005 version, so actually watch it and make judgements yourself, I would love to see a sequel to this film because it needs to find its balance and with a more suited director and less FOX interference it could be great. And may I say that all websites are giving 3/5 which isn't bad and on DS they are hating on it but give it 3/5 and they say its awful but they also praised the hell out of MI5 but only gave that 3/5 so it cool to hate this perfectly good film.Better than fantastic people said this would be terrible movie but the thrills and great link between the four characters it turned out to be the best comic book movie iv'e seen all year,This has stunning visuals great action and good humor my personal favorite was johnny storm even doe he was a different skin color.If your not a big fantastic four or don't really know about them then this is the perfect superhero movie for you to watch my final rating is 10/10 it is a must see i and i am definitely buying it on DVD.I don't know why its got a 5/10 on IMDb and i think the director did amazing work on this film.If you not busy on the weekends then go watch it.Old ideas in todays world get with the times The biggest problem I keep running into with movie's "inspired" by comics are change. I get that people can be and are naturally resistant to change. Many of today's comics were created in a time where racism and difference meant something bad. Agree with that comment or not. Today's movies centered on old comic books ideas and uniting them with what we "want" today. I see nothing wrong with this. 90% of comments on this movie say something about the human torch being black. Well I say shame on you. I am proud to be fan of comics in a time where we are attempting to break boundaries with old ideas into a new age and if you can't grasp that¬Ö.then again. Shame on you.Fantastic Film (Mind The Pun) I honestly don't understand how people didn't like this. I guess if you was expecting avengers or some other recent Marvel film then you was disappointed. I love how the film wasn't all fighting like most hero films now, and the fact that you get to see each persons background and some childhood insights is amazing. I was put off this film when it first come out because of all the low ratings, and have only just took the plunge to watch it tonight, but I'm so glad i did. This is probably one of my favourite films. If you want avengers, go and see avengers. Don't just right a bad review because you was expecting something else. The trailer didn't make out the film was something different. I hope Marvel etc don't feel disheartened by all the bad reviews and decide not to make a sequel because this film s amazing.Much Better than Expected 10/10 My honest rate would be 7.5/10 but I'm putting 10/10 to get the ridiculous ratings up for this movie. I thought the movie was great. I am a fan of the comics since the 80s during the John Byrne era. The movie captured the family theme perfectly and felt just like the comic. The only thing missing was some comical rivalry scenes between Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm. I like the setup very much. Ben Grim's tagline "It's clobberin' time" get's its own origin story. The racial inclusion of a black Johnny Storm was seamless. I would love to see the FF hang with the Inhumans on screen but the studios have no respect for American art. Also we would really need Quicksilver to be alive for the whole Quicksilver/Medusa arc. The bad reviews are undeserved. I suspect there was some sort of campaign to kill this movie's potential before it left the barn to push the studio to give up it's rights. Selling the rights would make up for the losses on this expensive film. We'll never know. I'm looking forward to FF2 regardless. Please bring us Galactus and make him tall and purple and not a frickin' cloud, please! Bye.Much better than other previous Fantastic Four movies I don't know why this movie is so badly reviewed. OK, it's not The Shawshank Redemption but it's in my view much better than previous Fantastic Four movies. The background of why they turns like heroes is better explained than before.  It's more serious again than previous one. I will not go outside after viewing this movie taking a walk and thinking about the philosophy of my life but man, it's a real good science fiction movie no? It's a remake that like Batman, Superman and Spider Man that tells me that we always can make better. I recommend it to anyone who like good no brain science fiction movie.Just say no to herd-think What's all the Fuss about ? The way people were critical of this movie I expected it to be hideous, a waste of time and a hot mess! As I watched it, I thought it was interesting and the characters were well drawn, except for Ben Grimm I think should have been someone with the "Flatbush/Yancy Street" attitude, also, physically bigger and a college athlete type (like the comic book). The story veered from the comics as a lot of the superhero movies do, but this version was fascinating and well done. And Victor Von Doom, don't know what all the criticism was but this version was very powerful and scary, and had powers not found in the comic storyline, but with an open mind, you could definitely see a lot here to appreciate. By the end of the movie, I was like "WTF", this is as good as any of the other superhero movies. This was a very good movie. Check this movie out for yourself and don't listen to the campaign of naysayers, make up your own mind on this movie. This is a movie I've been waiting months to see. I'm a big Marvel Comics and movie fan. This is one well crafted, superhero and super fun. I gave it 10 stars all day! If you're a real fan, you'll love it...If you're out for blood... I had a free movie ticket to use last night, and while I was not going to use it on Pixels or Vacation, my other options were to see Ant- man again, or see Fantastic 4. I've been perusing the boards on IMDb and I've seen nothing but malice; but it was free. I went into the theater expecting to see something as bad as X-men 3 or Ghost Rider, or god forbid, something worse than the first 2 F4 movies. When I left the theater, I left angry. I wasn't angry at the movie, and I wasn't angry at Hollywood. I was angry at you.  And I get it! Everyone has a chip on their shoulder because Hollywood is pumping out either EPIC blockbusters, nonsensical indie movies, or absolute pig swill. Pixels was a last straw; the beginning of the new era where everyone isn't just a critic, but a legitimate movie reviewer. Pixels was torn to shreds, and there is still blood in the water. F4 was sadly wading in the pool when it all went down, and has been blasted for no GOOD reason. I believe this film is the sad casualty of the mob mentality of the average Joe. You didn't understand what the movie was shooting for, and therefore couldn't see it for what it was. This movie is NOT: The Avengers. Or really any super hero film that has come out in the last two decades. The CGI effects are 90% amazing. There were a few shots of the Thing and Reed that were a little less than perfect, but I'll allow that blame to fall on executive rushing. This movie is NOT: A huge budget action flick. It's not self aware like Deadpool, it's not drummed up with anticipation like Avengers, it's not a Shakespearean trip to Asgard. This movie IS: A new idea for hero flicks. It finely walks the line between the realism of The Dark Knight, and the Sci-fi nature of the source material. I thought it walked the line very well. There are sci-fi horror-esque scenes that help you feel the real fear in the 4. There are balls out action scenes where the thing is tearing apart a small army (This scene shouldn't have been reduced to a TV viewing screen, probably a Trank scene that Fox cut for no good reason). The over all tone is Super 8 meets the X-men. Did you want a huge movie? Sorry there bub, this isn't for you. Did you want to be catered with easy to swallow cheesiness and shallow dialogue? Probably not your cup of tea either. If you wanted a movie that acts as a great launchpad for future explorations into space, our messed up military, REAL science fiction, and more than just a popcorn flick, this is for you. If you wanted a movie that didn't HAVE to be huge to be fun, didn't HAVE to be ultra real to be believable, and actually has the ability to save some of the hugeness to bank later, this is the one for you. The characters are REAL. The villain isn't over the top and laughable. Reed learns his place and has DIMENSION. You actually feel sorry for the Thing instead of wishing you could be made of rock. Human torch is ACTUALLY hot headed, not just wise cracking and sexy. Sue Storm plays a REAL introvert, not someone flower just waiting to bloom. Trank took an odd route and made a smaller movie, in hopes to get bigger and bigger with each sequel, and you pooped all over him for having the balls to go small. I really liked this movie for being what it set out to be; 4 scared kids gain powers they can't quite control, get exploited by our government and learn how to be a team in a real world with real consequences.  This movie lands above the middle for Marvel movies. There have been A lot worse (Looking at you Iron Man 2-3) and there have been better (Winter Soldier was rad as hell). Hopefully the world comes to it's senses before we don't get another sequel, Galactus can be redeemed on the silver screen, and we can maybe in the next decade get an Onslaught movie.Best movie of the decade! This is the single greatest movie I've seen since the Godfather! Everything in this movie works, from the comedic script playing off of action movie clich√©s to the intentionally awful CGI and action sequences. This movie takes so many risks and they all pay off. It is marketed to the action movie audience, but the few who were lucky enough to watch it were in for a huge treat. They were witness to one of the greatest satirical comedies of this century! It plays off of every single action movie clich√© perfectly, without skipping a beat it goes from clich√© to clich√© brilliantly. I love this movie and it will always be one of the greatest ever made.The fantastic fantastic four I would actually give this movie a 9 but I thinks its deserves an higher average. I don't understand why people think this movie is so bad. Yes the reshoots are very obvious with the ugly wig. But there is act very well by an amazing cast, and I think the music is very beautiful. So what's the problem? When I saw the trailer I was immediately hooked. So I went to the cinema and I couldn't believe that some people don't love this. Yes I understand that building the teleporter and that they try too control their power is boring for some people but that was that I loved the most. I hope that there will be a part two and I look forward to it. But I think it was very stupid to let Kate Mara cut her hair when they weren't totally finished yet. In musicals there are a lot of wigs and they don't look fake at all. Maybe they run out of time. But I don't think you have to react so negative because it's a great storyGreat re envisioning of the original thank you Marvel I seriously don't understand the bad ratings from users on this Title This release continues Marvels work in taking their stories out of the bubblegum uneducated space of the 90's and 2000s Well written and re envisioned with a unique story line i prefer the unknown actors who do a much better job than the Hollywood high and mighty stooges of the previous release who seem to rely on CGI to make their performances tolerable. I mean really is it more likely that solar flare radiation could create the fantastic four ? Considering that we get exposed to solar radiation every day of our lives. Thank you marvel for actually catering to people with brains and imaginationWhat's so bad about this? I was prepared to hate this movie. Everything about it screamed disaster. As a Marvel fan, I was annoyed that the story sounded unfaithful to the source material. I was skeptical of the cast looking not much like the classic characters I knew. I wasn't too impressed by the trailers (which, oddly enough, use a lot of footage not seen in the movie). Critics unanimously trashed the movie, so I assumed they can't all be wrong. Most alarmingly of all, even the director, Josh Trank, publicly complained about his own movie on its own opening day, absolutely confirming that this movie must be an absolute train-wreck. Even though I already knew it had to be horrible, out of curiosity, I had to see for myself just how bad it really was. So I went to see it today. The opening sequence, when the characters were kids, wasn't so bad. So I thought maybe it probably gets worse when they grow up. As it went along, I kept expecting it to go completely downhill at some point. Maybe it goes sour when they get their powers. But it still wasn't bad. Maybe when the villain unleashes his evil powers, that's when it all falls apart. But no, Dr. Doom was actually kinda awesome. By the time of the big action scene at the end, I had to admit to myself I was really enjoying this. Dare I say it, this is actually a good movie! I have no reason to be biased about this. After all, walking into the theater, I fully expected a terrible movie. So why does everyone seem to hate it? I have a few guesses: 1) For one thing, it's not faithful to the source material. This is not the Fantastic Four we've been familiar with up until now. The characters don't look like or act like previous incarnations. They're not the fun family of superheroes we all know. But this movie doesn't try to be faithful, it does its own thing and that's not necessarily a bad thing. 2) It's not as action-packed as the typical superhero movie these days. It's a fairly slow-paced movie. I guess this would disappoint you if you expected more fights and explosions throughout the whole thing. But this did not bother me, because I found the slow build-up of the story and gradually increasing intensity of the movie to be engrossing enough to keep me interested. 3) Fanboys and their attitude of expressing loyalty to one thing by unleashing rage at its competitors. Currently the general consensus among fanboys seems to be that Marvel/Disney "rulez," while Fox, Sony, and even DC/Warner Bros "sux;" so all the review scores tend to be skewed in Marvel/Disney's favor. How else can you explain the high review scores of those lame Iron Man sequels? Fantastic Four (2015), being a Fox property, unfortunately makes it an easy target for the Internet fanboy legions. 4) If there's a flaw that matters to me though, it's that, admittedly, some of the character relationships could have been better. The Fantastic Four are supposed to all have interesting dynamics with each other, but some of the relationships just weren't developed. For instance, I'm not so sure if Jamie Bell and Kate Mara even interacted with each other once throughout the whole movie. Also, we all know the characters Reed &amp; Sue are supposed to be each others' romantic interests, but this was only barely touched upon in this movie. I guess these relationships were something to be explored in a sequel, one that doesn't look like it's gonna happen, considering this one's underwhelming performance and reception unfortunately. "Easter egg" alert: The Human Torch has a Fire Flower from the Super Mario Bros hanging from his car's rear-view mirror. That was actually a pretty clever reference to throw in there for video game fans. Good job, Trank, or whoever thought of tossing that in there. Concluding thoughts: I should know better by now than to trust the hive-mind of movie critics. Believe it or not, sometimes the hive-mind is wrong. Even if all the critics are haters, see it for yourself and make your own decision. I for one was pleasantly surprised by this movie and maybe you will be too.Focus on the characters, not on the FX I rated this movie with 10 because it absolutely does not deserve a rating of 4.0! If you want to have a giant battle of sfx and cgi, some funny one-liners and the usual militaristic propaganda, watch Avengers: Age of Ultron or Guardians of the Galaxy or similar crap. If you want convincing and developing characters, a well written script, good dialogues, an excellent cast, a great musical score and an attitude that rejects the militaristic habitus in general, this one is for you. This is storytelling without telling too much. We have four troubled kids, but their background is not overdrawn at all. There are just some little hints: the impressive face of Miles Teller and the laconic remark "My parents weren't interested" tell a story that needs no staged melodrama. Likewise the problematic relation between Johnny Storm and his father. Talking about Johnny Storm: the movie makers made him afro-American and used the character to illustrate the perfidious habit of the US military to enlist young black men with poor social background and dull prospects. Of the background of Victor von Doom we also just get some glimpse, not the whole story. There obviously had been some incidents and you always feel them under the surface, but it is not necessary for the story to know all the details. The only flaw is the showdown. It comes to rash, the characters that had some serious problems of trusting each other bond again too fast and the solution in fighting Doom comes as well too fast, too linear and too easy. Just ten minutes more of suffering and trying to sort out their personal issues and the problem "Doom" would have done it. I hope they will not drop this because of unbelievable bad rating! Because Miles Teller is the very best Richard Reed of all times!please don't waste your money and time want to watch this movie? watch the 2005 version and bang your head against the wall. that would be more enjoyable. I know they had director problems but the problem is not that; the issue is that the story is awful. spend an hour with foreplay, 10 minutes for real action and a pathetic ending. this is the Fantastic Four! director blows, cast is okay, just a terrible script/story. good luck with number 2. It looks like you are repeating the history of the 2005 version and the silver surfer version. no one who has ever had an interest in the books has any respect for what you have done. Just another spider man, and spider man reboot. hire a real director, hire a good writing team that has actually read the books, pray to God that everyone doesn't think you are a joke, again. Learn how to make a graphic superhero movie. Don't sell out to some studio to make it PG or PG-13.Not recommended unless you want to commit suicide Childish story, idiotic characters, even more idiotic situations. No even thinking that is a superhero movie we can face the horrible, horrible film we have here. You poke seeing X-Men 3? Prepare to have an stomach cleanup. And beyond this horror circus, is the EVEN MORE MORONIC fact that Sue is still a black guy's sister. Could've worked if both were black, or if he was half black/half white. But as is presented, is an insult not only to spectator's intelligence, but Mendel Laws themselves. "Being politically correct" at the cinema is killing this industry. I asked for a refund, and half of the spectators were shouting behind me. On the premiere. Take note.Awful Simply awful as movie and I hope the director never ever get's any job again. The story was wrong, the background was wrong and even one actors skin colour was wrong. If you want to make a movie about an established comic then do it right and follow it. Otherwise don't do it. He could have done another movie with 4 or more superheroes, where are the Arabic person, the Indian person, the Asian person etc? There are tons and tons of super heroes out there to pick from if you want to be political correct, but guess what, not all groups is political correct and it's nothing wrong with that. This movie is simply awful, bad, horrible and should be avoided at all cost. The rating (4.3 atm) is way to high, I rather see Birdemic again before this one.Another millennials marvel movie that went bust Why is it that when Marvel caters to millennials in their movie making it seems to end up as a flop. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' and now this? Nothing can be redeemed from this movie, and I mean nothing! What were the writers thinking? It is so far removed from the original comic book script the story was beyond a different alternate Earth. The characters weren't even two dimensional. They were one dimensional. Fox seems to have a bad history in making poor inconsistent Marvel movies and problems with continuity. Look at all the X-Men movies. Do they even know where they were going? Look what they did with Deadpool in X-men Origins. Horrendous. 20th Century Fox should give up their rights to Disney since the Avenger movies seem to be on the right page. The comics have a wealth of information and stories. Why change it when the comics knew what they were doing? No wonder Fanatic Four wasn't released on normal media outlets like other movies like Ant-Man and Avengers: Age of Ultron, or Captain America: Winter Solider. Its probably because they didn't make enough money at the box office and are trying to get it back by making people pay for a worthless crappy film. I love Marvel, but 20th Century Fox is ruining the genre.This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen The word rubbish was create for this movie. I can't believe I just waste $10 for this trash.And you will be regret even you watch this movie for free. You can know 90% of the story by watching the trailer,and if you have brain, you can guess the rest 10%. The movie spend 50min to explain how the Fantastic four get their power,20min to show what their power could do,25min to find the boss and 15min to fight with him.Thats all, they kill the boss with one punch.... Do not watch this movie!!!! I'm not sure many time did fantastic four use their superpower in the movie, but I'm sure none of them has more than 15times. 100min.And this 100min is my darkness time in my life.NOT "effin" Fantastic at all... Don't waste your time Once again Fake Crap Hollywood makes a movie with ZERO substance and no feeling. Hope they loose a lot of money on this project. WHAT is so fantastic about this movie, seriously?? When they wrote the script, were they drunk or on some drugs?? Since it's all about story telling, I ask myself: "WHAT WERE THEY TELLING?" Well, The American government is all about turning everything to weapons... Weaponise EVERYTHING and basically kill everybody on the planet, no matter who. Second: it only takes ONE person to destroy the planet - so no need for protection because we have more than psycho here... No loving of the characters, actors themselves lacked acting skills (Well, Dr. Storm, the father was okay though, some feeling in his voice), no depth... nothing good at all - not even the CGI. Only good part was the very ending that informed how many job opportunities the movie created...Fantastic 4 are now mass murders through inaction? The movie for story is around a 3-4 elementary level story complexity. Nothing wrong with that many action movies have that and this is based off a comic book so we cant expect story perfection over. one base concept that they destroyed for any kids of the fantastic 4 for all time. and that is no action done by the fantastic 4 will lead to the death of others. What am I talking about. simply by them making a choice to do nothing caused human beings to stand no chance of being. its simple 1 in the scene where doom is sucking up the world there is a road with lots of traffic next to a secret military facility 1 ya right 2 when they go to other dimension all these vehicles go to other world and get sucked into a matter to energy converter. Invisible woman shields it so. Things stop going through.so first off a ton of people likely civilians stopped existing then all the people in the vehicles which had people at the end not a one of the 4 went to save back to our world 3rd when they destroy doom who is powering this open gate when he pass's it would close instantly, or the gate would not close soon as they pass through it after it closes back to our world. so the logic sucks. Now the fantastic four through in action are responsible for the death of unknown casualties themselves. because of simple inaction for all times to any kid who watched the movie. There is no take backs for that one. that would in itself annoy their comic origin fans for all time, then add the cheesy story. and the low rating the movie got was incredibly kind even if it was a story on the level of elementary school it did in its own way make sense. Still was a weak story even if another possible way they came into being. then given when they as for a place to work a super lab YA RIGHT though to be fair how many hero's stop in the middle of a villain fight go for civilian people What am I talking about after the fight when doom is dead,they didn't go to see if anyone survived. before they went through the gate in the air back to earth to take back with them still don't really recall many super hero movies actually showing he hero looking after the aftermath Yes they don't do that but at the same time under the situation anyone who knows cars went through would see if anyone was alive. even if the chance was 1 in a billion they would still look. anyone who knows cars went through which they could see would do so the fantastic four who are the Savior's of mankind now don't care about the little guy the normal ma and pa average Joe. Congrats for turning a icon into a nightmare to little kids everywhere.Miles Teller movies all suck Man I hate this guy so much ..seeing his face on screen makes me watch anything else ,How does he get work.

Man I hate this guy so much ..seeing his face on screen makes me watch anything else ,How does he get work. Must have a rich daddy. Watched 20 Min's of this movie and left the cinema as it did so bad!!!..end of review.....People, please stop saying it's a Marvel movie! It's NOT Just because it's based on Marvel comics doesn't mean it's made by Marvel Studios. It's made by FOX, which licensed the rights to the FF characters from Marvel years ago. Thus, any comparisons to other MCU films such as the recent Ant-Man are totally meaningless. And that is why it's such a mess. Marvel had no control over what FOX did with their source material. For those not aware, this film was plagued by problems from the start. The director was all but banned from the set and editing room in the final stage of production, after which a good deal of the footage was dumped and re-shot. In the end, it was slapped together by one of the producers and a temporary director, and the results show: there is a disconnect between the first two acts and the third. It's almost like there are two separate movies trying to co-exist, and it doesn't work.DHKR: Fantastic Four(2015)- "None Should Have to Endure Such Pain" I thought I knew bad movies. I thought I had been through such a hell before, and things could go up. I thought, in my mind, there was no possible way to top such films in a way of badness. I thought things could only go up from here, and that Hollywood was starting to care for the license of their products, putting time and effort within their movies. That all changed after Fantastic Four. I feel violated. I do feel like I'm violated as a person, a critic, and a fan of the Fantastic Four. NOTHING about this film is at all redeemable! NOTHING! And I swear, if one of these idiots try and defend this film and say it's a better movie then the original two FF Movies, I'M GONNA BLOODY SCREAM! The film, for some reason, wanted to go and take the DC route and make the film all dark and gritty and mature. However, the execution that is seen here makes all of the truly 'Dark' and 'Mature' moments seem more generically and laughably childish. The Fantastic Four, whoever you look at it, can't all be 100% dark and gritty. It's what gave the comic and, to some extent, the original FF movie from 2005 it's charm.  The characters within the film are now complete bastardizations of every other incarnation, with a huge lack of chemistry. Johnny and Sue Storm from the 2005 film, while not really that engaging, was at the very least believable, and no, not for the obvious reason seen here. The film wants us to believe that these two are dynamic brother and sister, and it dose not work. Johnny couldn't be any less charming unless they just end up making him a big villain. Instead of being a reckless, but good-hearted, the 2015 Johnny is now just reckless and stubborn. Oh, and you can tell he almost turns into a bad guy, because he supports the Militry and we all know that the Militry is always evil. Sue, by contrast to her 2005 counterpart, has devolved exponentially from a sort of love interest that had some good qualities to her into just another boring love interest that seems even MORE irritating here than before. Every scene she's in just sucks the life out of the audience, like she's just bored to be in this movie. She even takes the fun out of music, saying it's just a way to find out all the blooming patterns and....oh for hell's sake it's bloody music! Enjoy the bloody music like a bloody human being! Ben Grimm at the very least starts off as one of the lesser bastardized characters. That is until after the Four get their powers, where he then becomes a complete CGI monstrosity with rocks all over his body. Then he becomes the Militry's brutish muscle, and once again if movie teaches you anything it's that Militry is bad and irredeemable in everything. It's almost as if both Ben Grimm, the quirky and smart Junkyard Jew, and The Thing, the big rock covered brute are two completely different characters now. Unlike the 2005 version, love it or hate it, where the character is constant, if one could call it that. If there is one part of the film I feel really divided over, it's on Doctor Doom. Now, Victor Von Doom wasn't represented to his full extent in the 2005 version. However, at the very least he LOOKED and ACTED like Doctor Doom! Here, he's a chubby, video game playing Left Winger against the Militry and Government instead of the all powerful, definitive symbol of Fascism and the powers of evil like he was in the comics. However, it is pretty refreshing to see a Left Wing villain, so I'll give the film that. And he even has a lot of cool scenes devoted to him, showing off all that power he has, and by GOD is this great potential for a recurring villain!  That is until they kill him off five minutes later. Yeah, I'm not kidding about that, they LITERALLY kill off Doctor Doom, no less then five minutes after he becomes Doctor Doom. Not only that, but it was done in the most clich√©d way possible, with having the four simply combine their unique powers to stop the villain. They axed off one of Marvel's most powerful, most cunning, and most diabolical super villain in the most disrespectful, and most novice way possible.  I can't believe I hate a movie like this...well, THIS much. I think the only other movie I hated just as much was Alexander and The Needlessly Long Title. But now, I think that crown has been taken by this horrible excuse for a comic book movie. I hate this film. I hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate it! Hate it! I hate that anyone can be dumb enough to find salvageable things and nicer things to say about it. And guess what, the idiots behind this film still want sequels, spin offs even! From THIS! You just axed off one of the Four's well known recurring menace and you want to milk this sickly cow!? I don't usually like cursing on film reviews to an extreme but...F-yay Fantastic Four 2015!  The Final Result for this film is an E-RANKING! AN E! A ONE-HALF STAR!  This has got to be, compared to the 2005 film and Rise of The Silver Surfer, the WORST Fantastic Four movie I've had the displeasure of seeing! Don't you even THINK about wasting your money on this, Don't you DARE give 20th Century Fox and Josh Trank your hard earned money! Cause if you do, then more CRAP like this can come out both their asses and onto our favorite superhero team!Fantborestic It's bad really really bad the acting is too emotionless, the thematic running time they just got it all wrong, and heck most of the exciting cool action stuff is only done in 1 freaking minute and to make things more worse they always keep talking in dark rooms they have really poor grasp on the source material like how doctor doom have super powers even though in the comics he only uses his own intellect brain. The other Fantastic four movies failed too but at least it fail of what the comic books made them so special it's really a huge shame when it doesn't have anything to do with the comic books in general and when you add it all up the Hammer head film is the only one where they choose to fight crime *AND* not cause the destruction and chaos along the way HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN HOW THIS IN 2 REBOOTS YOU TRIED TO MAKE IT BETTER!?! All I could say is that there's a good way and a wrong way to ever reboot a famous franchise and this is definitely the wrong way. P.S It was made by the people who made awesome X men films how could they muck it up!?!Awful... I know you can re-imagine origin stories for superheroes but, to be honest, in this case - leave well enough alone. On top of that, this film doesn't come that much later than the original Marvel FF4 origin film. The origin there was tweaked from the original in the comic books (but at least it was in space.....) Putting that aside - why reboot so soon? Plenty of films carry on the narrative and re-cast. I know that FF4 The Silver Surfer didn't go down too well (especially with the character of Galactus) but this film takes it to new lows. I read that the director produced a very different film which the studio demanded major re-shoots to. Maybe we will never see a director's cut but this studio cut is boring. Dull. Tedious. Unimaginative. But let's not lay all the blame at the studio's door. Script? Awful. Slow. Lacking in action. Lacking in character development. Lacking in generation of sympathy for any of the characters. Casting? It may have been a creative decision to make the lead characters almost children (though, as has been pointed out elsewhere, their screen ages and the ages of some of the actual cast are miles apart) but that decision gives them no gravitas. And Johnny Storm isn't black. Except in this film. Very strange. I am all for more black characters in Marvel films - great to see War Machine and The Falcon given more screen time - and more to come in the next Avengers film, along with The Black Panther. Can I put in a word for Black Goliath as well? But I still fail to understand why a white character in the comics becomes black in the films... first Nick Fury and now The Human Torch. Actually I felt most of the film was miscast. The Thing - they did him with CGI and so he doesn't look real - like the Hulk. You can so tell it's CGI. Someone said to me: well that's 1 1/2 hours of your life you'll never get back - and he was so right. If the studio has any sense it will sell the DVD/Blu ray to people (if it can) and not make a sequel.Would make a decent school project The first fifteen, or maybe even twenty minutes (Reed and Ben as kids, the science fair) had me interested and made me think this film was going somewhere. But boy, was I wrong. There were a lot of super long scenes that simply just made audiences lose interest, for example 'building the machine', or the aftermath of the journey through the 'other dimension'. Personally, I feel these scenes were extended just to make the movie longer. I will admit I enjoyed the bit with Dr. Doom walking through the hall, it was super bad-boy and very well done. That scene is definitely one to watch again - if you have not seen the film due to poor reviews, I highly recommend you watch that bit. The dialogue in 'Fantastic Four' could be compared by one made in middle school. I was literally covering my face in my hands in a few scenes. It was impossible to like/hate the characters when everything they say feels fake. This is evident in the scene when they explore the 'other dimension'. When Victor Doom falls in the green liquid, I did not flinch a muscle. I did not say 'Oh no! Not Victor!' like the filmmakers expected me to. And it was all due to the (very) poor dialogue.  But nothing beats the ending: 'That's fantastic.' 'Say that again.' 'That's fantastic.' 'Hmm...' FANTASTIC FOURSaturday Morning Kids' TV show here As I sat through this fiasco, it kept nagging me that I've seen this sort of thing before, but I couldn't recall what movie. Then it dawned on me, it wasn't in a movie theater, it was the kind of action junk they showed on Saturday morning television when I was a kid. If only Power Rangers had shown up to salvage this mess. Nerd's science fair project touches on the borders of all known laws of physics. Nerd goes on to college where, surprise, his work completes a super-secret project the government's NASA/CIA/Area 51 scientists couldn't quite figure out. OK, this works for a comic book. For a movie, at some point the nerd needs to become an adult. That's where they dropped the ball on this one. The Reed Richards character was so miscast, it wasn't even funny. You know, how some movies are bad enough that you laugh at how bad they are? This casting choice was beyond bad. The "parallel dimension" planet looked like a bad imitation of Vulcan, out of Star Trek. Or a bunch of those mashed-potato mountains Richard Dreyfuss carved during dinner in Closer Encounters, with phosphorescent glow-in-the-dark gravy being poured over them. At one point, I swear I could see sunshine coming through the windows of the building where they shot the studio/set action scenes "on the planet surface,", before going to post-production computer animation graphics. I couldn't quite make out the wires Sue Storm was hanging from in her airborne sequences, but I swear that's how they did it, it just looks so freakin' cheap. Like the old Peter Pan show starring Mary Martin, you know - - - just pretend you don't see what you're lookin' at. The inter-dimensional travel modules were simply upsized versions of a Ronco kitchen gadget, you know, like they used to advertise on those Saturday afternoon infomercials? ("Snaffles humans into any size dimension, alternate universe, or the building next door ... and it really, really works!!!"...if only it could have sliced and diced this script...) The Human Torch is a black guy? What?? The Thing actor did a creditable job of playing a live boulder. OK, let me re-read that last sentence.....Did I really write that? A guy playing a big boulder does the best acting in this flick. Hmmm, nope. Kudos to the guy playing Thing for his spot-on portrayal of live rocks. OK, you can't say that in any way that comes out serious. Hey, I tried. There is simply no positive thing to say about this movie.
Nolan's masterpiece, one of the best sci-fi movie I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie. And this is IT! When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will. First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way. The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are.  These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years). Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him "X". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet).  Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us. Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly "X", will managed to convince you about that. My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say "we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that. This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought.Interstellar : An open-hearted &amp; mastered Human Odyssey The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film. You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar.  Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful &amp; intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded.  I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured. Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves "behind" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the "black hole beyond the horizon" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, "all it takes is a little push ! " *you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out. F√©lix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014A Visually Monumental And Thoughtful Sci-Fi Epic I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema.An Emotional, Beautiful Journey into the Unknown (This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style) There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit. Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film. Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece. This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar.'Interstellar' 'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the "fi" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date.A good - not great - movie that falls apart the more you think about it. Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge, intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he's making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from greatness. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot and engineer, is now reluctantly scraping together a living as a farmer on a starving Earth. With sandstorms swirling and food supplies dwindling by the day, it doesn't seem likely that Cooper's children, stoic Tom and inquisitive Murphy, will have much of a world left to inherit when they grow up. While investigating a "ghost" in Murphy's bedroom, Cooper deciphers a message that brings him to a top-secret NASA base. Once there, Cooper learns from his former mentor, Dr Brand (Michael Caine), that NASA is looking for solutions to Earth's crisis in other galaxies. A recently-opened wormhole has given NASA and its scientists access to a whole new galaxy of planets. Brand appeals to Cooper to pilot the final and most important mission: to determine whether any of three identified planets can truly host human life. But it's a journey from which Cooper might never return - one that will take him away from his kids and everything he has ever known and loved. That's not even the half of it ‚Äì Nolan's narrative is a sprawling, ambitious one that asks heavy metaphysical questions about the position and role of humanity in the universe, filtered through the prism of a father and daughter whose bond transcends time and space. It's shot through with complex scientific theories about wormholes and time travel courtesy of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (who served as a consultant on the film). Indeed, much of Interstellar plays with such philosophical gravity that one can't help wondering if it's simply too deep a subject to be effectively communicated in a movie that must also create emotional stakes and real characters. Clocking in at almost three hours, Interstellar pulses with intelligence and occasional bursts of brilliance. The science and emotion of its story works best on each planet they manage to visit, with Nolan crafting some chillingly smart sci-fi moments amidst the human drama experienced by Cooper's crew. As badly as Cooper wants to save enough fuel to make the return trip home, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) has both professional and personal stakes in visiting the planet that's furthest away from the wormhole. They trade hope for time, the minutes they use to hunt for salvation translating into the loss of decades with their loved ones. The film is at its best when the members of the Endurance - including David Gyasi's Romilly and Wes Bentley's Doyle - confront one another, and establish contact (or fail to do so) with the scouting teams that preceded them through the wormhole. But Interstellar also suffers from a bloated and faintly silly final act. The science of it may be well-founded (who knows, after all, what miraculous answers really do lie within a black hole?) and the concept very cool, but it doesn't quite translate as such. Instead, the film hyper-blasts itself into a oddly cheerful (and confusing) ending that feels purely fictional and not at all scientific. There's no denying, either, that Nolan could have carved half an hour or more out of Interstellar without losing any of its narrative or emotional density. Instead, many scenes unfold in an almost obstinately languid fashion, including a moment when Cooper is left gasping for oxygen on the icy terrain of an alien planet. It's pretty evident, too, that Nolan really wanted to make sure his audiences knew how little greenscreen he used to make the film; for no other discernible reason, his camera lingers in extreme close-up - and far too often - on the exterior shells of the various spacecrafts designed for the film. Nolan can afford the best when it comes to his cast as well, and it shows. McConaughey anchors the film with a gravitas and tenderness quite unknown before his career McConnaissance, and he's ably supported by a steely Hathaway, whose character, just like the film she's in, blends cold, pragmatic science with a churning wealth of emotion. Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon, in roles perhaps best left unspecified to avoid any explicit spoilers, are excellent too - the former radiates quite enough warmth and intelligence to make us believe that she can save the world, and the latter admirably treads in morally grey areas to good effect. For months before its release, Nolan kept Interstellar firmly under wraps. Everyone speculated that it would be a game-changer - a sci- fi blockbuster as thrilling and thought-provoking as it is entertaining. In some ways, that's true of the final product: Nolan's film is brave, brainy film-making, and it looks absolutely spectacular. But, on closer examination, Interstellar loses some of its gloss and varnish - and beneath it all lies an unwieldy script that meanders a little too long and wastes a little too much of the big, breathtaking ideas that underpin its story.A Love Story Against The Backdrop Of A Grand Interstellar Travel Love is the one thing that transcends time and space...  New creation of Christopher Nolan's genius, whose name is now known to everyone. His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won't forget this trip, this can be assured.  I was madly waiting for Interstellar's release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer's imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn't want to let her dad in the infinity darkness.  Starting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it's all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won't fly quickly for you. You'll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of "Endurance" starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself. The emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey's character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy' and Jessica Chastain' character. And the acting work of these three artists in "Interstellar" impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film's supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere. The script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the "Space Odyssey" and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It's also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan's work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar. Hans Zimmer's score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: "Once we become parents, we can't help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children", deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself.  Visual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The "Endurance" itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's "Odyssey", and they are pleasing to the eye. Many thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan's life.  "Interstellar" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan's genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values ‚Äã‚Äãand emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again.  "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light."A familiar journey to the unknown, albeit a grand one So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take: To avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good. Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before. For seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time. Similarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop. One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released. After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown. Because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us.Disappointed I am a Nolan fan but, and perhaps that's why, I see Interstellar as a failed magic act. The multi-layered surprise and amazement that we have come to expect of Nolan's films did not deliver. I believe this particular film, like Prometheus, failed due to the maker's inherent desire to create an epic - it took on too much, tried too hard and did it all wrong.  I'm willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of artistic creativity, assume space suits and modern telecommunication systems pass unscathed through black holes (and really, who knows?) but there are things that cannot be excused with the budget and resources at the disposal of this genius film-making team (such as bad script and poor plot planning).  IDEA / PLOT The overarching idea is good, if not new. I found it hard to feel amazed by the (too many) plot twists. Ultimately the combination of all of them was tepid. We were expecting Murphy to be older than Cooper midway onwards. Murphy's brilliant solution leading to mankind's escape from earth failed to awe. Firstly - a massive stretch on the Morse code / quantum data, secondly - the two laugh-out-loud "eureka" moments - and thirdly, the "aha" factor on seeing the new, curved reality space station was completely missing that feeling - "aha, so that was it, that's what it was all about". More failures - Matt Damon segue and the very overdone "ghost" revelation. SYMBOLISM / KEY TWIST The portrayal of the time dimension within a three dimensional world in the form of the undulating bookshelf wall was beautifully rendered. However everything else about that scene felt wrong - the space-suited Cooper - would he have stayed in exactly that form inside a singularity even if future advanced beings - them / us - have helpfully carved him a neat 3-D nook in a 5-D world? This needed exploration and some complexity. The continuation of his radio communication equipment felt way too convenient, the whole frantic scene "explained" again by the unexplained rush that's a hallmark of this film. So, although the symbolic setup was good, I had to work hard to suspend disbelief - to get Cooper to the back of the bedroom wall and have him throw out clues using gravity and love as forces transcending dimensions - why back of the wall? Why not front? Why did the space-time continuum stop him there (that you can't go back in the time dimension, does not explain how he could gravitationally interfere with that particular room - in the past - and why he couldn't, I don't know, leave a Morse code message to himself well before all of this happened? Also, why his daughter? We get no clue in the first part of the film why this duo in particular is chosen, the only hint to Murhpy's future proclivity for the sciences coming from a penchant for decoding Morse and Michael Caine's all- forgiving view of her as a"firebrand" or something such.) PACING / DIALOG Plot pacing was terrible (variously too slow and too fast). Dialog was terrible. It would have benefited from further revision and thought around how to present this particular story to the layman. I found myself wondering how an actor of Matt Damon's caliber did not just wave a huge red flag when he had to say why Prof Brand knew the mission would fail -"because he could not reconcile quantum physics with the theory of relativity" (not a direct quote). Even if he isn't a physicist. The only lines I can still recall liking in the film are by Dylan Thomas (also overused). PRESENTATION I write this with only an armchair enthusiasm for physics, familiarity limited to the most dumbed-down works of Stephen Hawking. I found most of the science concepts used very trite - wormholes, black holes, relativity, time dilation - trite because of their portrayal as convenient plot tools. Having agreed in an extreme and completely unexplained hurry to leave his family behind perhaps forever, we then find out that Cooper needs to be told these concepts one at a time using, at varying moments, a folded paper pierced by a pen, oyster/pearl metaphors, and a suddenly-presented love interest for Anne Hathaway (that plot point on love being an unexplained force was particularly deeply unconvincing). I understand some of the angles needed to be explained to most people, but Nolan has done hard things more elegantly in the past. That is where one expected Nolan to deliver.  As things were it made you wonder the entire time why this crew was the best of humanity. Murphy's law, indeed. ACTING Matthew McConaughey's drawl was sporadic and seemed unnecessary. His character did not convince me either that he was the guy who is most capable of being spontaneously recruited for an urgent NASA mission (and what if he had refused?), nor that he was the guy who loved his daughter in a unique way that transcended dimensions (or more so than anyone else), nor even as a suitable candidate to return from this odyssey with all its shenanigans through black holes, gyrating space stations and a cracked space helmet (!) We never know his history well enough. Anne Hathaway and the rest of the crew were no more impressive. Michael Caine was convincing, but ultimately confusing, as his confession left more questions asked than answered.  TARS stole the show, and should have had more lines. EFFECTS / SCORE The effects were not comparable to Gravity. I wondered why their spacecraft was not equipped with the basic equipment to check metrics / giant waves / frozen clouds / landing conditions when any commercial satellite today will do that for you and tell you where you are to a foot's accuracy. But, details. The score was beautiful, and one of Zimmer's best. What a waste.Less than stellar by at least 5 dimensions I got something out of this movie. I really did. It was 35 degrees Celsius outside the cinema and all I needed was a three hour nap in cool air-conditioning. Lucky me! The latest Nolan film, just there for the taking. It started off as I hoped it would, all dusty on the porch of some ranch in the middle of the U.S. otherwise known as nowhere, the end of the world syrupy American-style, little kid tugging at the heart strings - my eyelids already beginning to droop even before Coop and his daughter Murph wind up at some place that some old cockney and his very Jewish daughter inhabit (guess it only happens in movies with a blind casting director), but that was fine, I was almost in REM sleep - not having been able to process a word of dialogue from McConaughey in over 20 minutes. Pure bliss. And it got even better from an insomniac's point of view. Thanks to an absurd plot and woefully unimaginative CGI effects, my chin was almost on my chest when they landed on the first planet the other side of... well, let's just call it credulity. I don't sleep this well at home! Wait! We're going through another Kubrick-style time dimension - didn't we just spend half an hour on this planet re-using some special effects, this time made to look like giant waves, left over from Inception? I think so, but time warps so nicely when you're practically snoring. I think we lost an astronaut somewhere. Maybe that's the game. Who's next? I hope it's the astrophysicist who explains wormholes with a moebius strip he forgets to twist. Either that or it was origami for dummies. Maybe that *was* the guy we just lost - hard to tell, they all act the same. Flat as the dialogue. Thanks guys. Anyway, we can only pray it will be Hathaway soon. She's starting to keep me awake. How can a head bob about so much in weightlessness? But I'm being unfair; I think I remember her trying to act some of this script. Brave move from an Oscar winner. I'm starting to want my money back. Anyway, I'm roused a bit now and thus a bit grumpy. We're in another galaxy's version of Antarctica minus the faintest signs of life - this despite (because of?) the unzipping of a new bad actor. Fortunately, this actor goes even beyond his usual leaden deadness and I'm soon starting to lose consciousness again and time travel merrily back to the land of nod. I think there was a plot twist involved because this astronaut is trying to do a Dave and HAL routine. He must think he's in a good movie. Poor sod. Did I mention there must have been yards of Inception on the cutting-room floor last time because I'm watching more and more outtakes? Gotta save a few million here and there.  I had a dream. I dreamed that Nolan would come up with a slew of insanely bizarre plot twists right at the end that would explain the entire reason for watching this flick. But they carried me out on a stretcher before I found out if it was true. Apparently, I was having a nightmare screaming "Morse Code! No! No! No! Not Morse Code! That's Spielberg!" at the top of my lungs and disturbing the other patrons' naps. I was obviously paying too much attention even comatose.Got tricked by paid reviews I watched this movie yesterday. I was very excited after reading so many perfect 10 star reviews for this movie so I was expecting a perfect movie, really! Before I continue, I must say I really love sci-fi movies, and I am deeply interested in black holes, time travel, wormholes, interstellar traveling. Wow, I couldn't think twice, this could be the perfect fit for me! I had really high expectations. For the entire movie I was feeling like: "the best part of the movie should soon", but never came. I had hard time understanding what was really happening, and too many minutes of the movie were badly wasted in dramatic scenes of love, confusing speeches, formulas. All I wanted to see was the wormhole travel, spacetime and gravity distortion, galaxies, nebulae, etc. I mean, I wanted to see what is in the deep space, and what could be human life in a planet million light years away from us. SPOILERS AHEAD Maybe the movie drove me nuts, or I lost interest, but after they crossed into the new galaxy, all I felt was confusion. I never understood what was really happening, what were they rescuing, what were those 3 planets and how they knew too much about them, why was there a black hole? Even I tried hard connecting every scene and plot in the movie, I failed.  What I disliked the most was the fact that the feeling of discovering something AMAZING and new was not successfully transmitted to us. I wanted to feel that great emotion of discovering deeps space but I failed. Instead the characters talked about crazy physics and plans to save humanity. Not to mention the multi-plot scenes after the fight, totally no sense. Please don't get tricked by this website and fake reviews ad I did. This is reason I signed up at IMDb (first review), to warn others. The idea of the movie is fantastic, but poorly developed and acted, totally confusing, too much clich√©. Watch it but don't have high expectations as me, you will be disappointed.Oh, no! It is incomprehensible to me that I watched the same movie that the majority of reviewers of this movie on IMDb seemed to. Perhaps I was unknowingly sucked into a blackhole, wormhole, or plot hole that most of the other reviewers of this movie managed to avoid. All I know is that my hard-earned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with me and for that I am truly regretful. Like a few other commenters, I had absolutely no feelings or connection with any of the characters, even hoping at times that they would all fail in their meaningless endeavors. A ridiculous premise with outlandish and unscientific bases, very little of this movie makes any sense at all. It amazes me that Nolan was able to draw the acting talent to this waste of time, as their considerable skills are completely wasted on this drivel. I should note that on several occasions, I actually couldn't help but laugh out loud at the absurdity, and that fact was truly telling for me. Mr. Nolan, et al - you owe me two hours and forty-nine minutes of my life back!Epic in every way! Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you loved Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get ready to get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!What a massive disappointment Though I am not a Bat-person, and do not wish to become one, I have admired Christopher Nolan for his early films and 'Inception', though, with the exception of 'Insomnia', I always regarded them as, in the immortal words of Andrew Sarris 'less than meets the eye'. I do not like to call films pretentious, but with 'Memento' and 'Inception' the word certainly came to mind. They seemed shallow pretending to be deep. The same is, in my opinion, certainly true of 'Interstellar'. Yes, it carries you along for a ride, and yes the special effects are great, and yes, it might give us pause to think what will, in fact, be the destiny of our species. But, my dear Mr Nolan, surely you must realise that our species will not survive by planting American flags on distant planets. And, like 'Gravity' before it, the search for a happy ending has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone before. The image of Cooper floating around Saturn without his spaceship, waiting to be picked up by a passing probe (just before his oxygen runs out, of course) is so ridiculous that if Stanley Kubrick were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the 'starchild' at the end of '2001', he'd punch you in the nose.  'Interstellar' - for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic time dilation and very clever (I do not use that word in a derogatory sense) visual representation of multi-dimensional string theory towards the end, is void of any real cultural insight. The film simply extends 'The Wizard of Oz' into the space age and decides at the end that there is really somewhere better than home. It is TOSH! Great films tell us something memorable about the human condition, or the nature of cinema itself. This film, for all its quotes from Dylan Thomas does neither. It is for people who think that the word 'awesome' has some profound meaning and not, as is the case, an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction.  Any suggestion that it deserves a Best Picture Oscar is a sad comment on the way that those awards have become debased in recent years.Dumb, dumber, dumbest! This is without exception one of the dumbest films I have ever sat through. Or perhaps it's a masterpiece and I'm too dumb to understand it? Anyway ..... Here are some of the things (the list is not exhaustive) that I could not get my head around. There is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world. And the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says, 'Oh well. Dem's the breaks' and does nothing. Seriously? Apart from that one dude in the 'super secret' NASA compound? Okay then. A super intelligent, super advanced alien civilization has been watching us. They see that the planet is in peril. That more than six thousand million people will die from starvation. So they offer a solution. Not by curing the blight mind. No, that would be far too easy. They construct a wormhole (they being five dimensional creatures 'n' all) close to Saturn ('cos Kubrick had already used Jupiter in 2001). The film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight (cornmash beer anybody) but it's only a matter of time before that too succumbs. So It's a matter of great urgency that the astro-heroes get to the ol' wormhole as quickly as possible.  So the far side of the Moon would be a handy place to put it.  No, no, noooo. They place the wormhole beside Saturn. So distant from Earth that it takes two years just to fly there.  And all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called Dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at Pharming College. Anybody for cornflakes?  Now NASA have already explored the wormhole. They know that it opens into another galaxy, beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds. Because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole, time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on Earth. While back on ol' Planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace. So this was the plan? By the super intelligent aliens? Is someone taking the p*ss? There were no planets anywhere that were ... um ... NOT right beside a black hole? Super intelligent? Doh!  And so finally, after a number of silly subplots, our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole (My God! It's full of stars?). And experiences time as a physical construct. But is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? Hell no. He is shown his daughter's bedroom on the day that he left on his 'weekend getaway.' We see him getting really upset that his daughter isn't picking up on his STAY ...... STAY! gravity assisted message, even though he should remember that she shouted STAY .... STAY! to him on that day, and he left anyway. Sheesh!  And Zimmer's soundtrack? I hadn't heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email, without him ever seeing the movie. Explains a lot really. Presumably the email went something like 'If you produce anything orchestral like Kubrick, you're off the project.' So the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven (in the cinema where I watched it) piercingly loud quasi classical discordance. Bear in mind that Kubrick chose the pieces by Strauss, etc., to assist him in editing the movie,and then realised that they actually fit perfectly, and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned. Not Nolan. NoSirreeBob! Email it in, Hans. Who listens to the music anyway? Deeply, deeply disappointing. And I loved Inception!Grand ideas don't make great movies It is beyond me how people can claim the movie to be 'brainy', 'intelligent', 'well written'... With all the things I read about the movie prior to seeing it makes it the biggest disappointment I've experienced from cinema in years. I give 1 star to bring balance to the current rating, in reality this movie is of course not that bad. The whole idea behind the plot is that McConaughey ended up in this blackhole where 5 dimensions were compressed into 3 dimensions and stuff, and where he was able to manipulate gravity by sending his daughter the message which was imperative for saving humanity. So what in fact happened is through this ridiculously improbable chain of events McConaughey ended up inside this blackhole. All this was apparently the result of a bigger plan all along. Was there really no easier way for (future humans/aliens) to transmit this data, and if they built this time-space warping machine inside the blackhole - means they had access to the data all along? And also means they chose McConaughey daughter on purpose? So I don't understand, what was this purpose? Could they not have connected their portal to professor's office a long time ago, or go for one of the ten billion more rational alternatives? On a side note: is it not funny how McConaughey ignored the message NOT TO GO from the same 'ghost' yet followed the rest of the directions? While in the end of the movie he idiotically repeats his feeble attempt. Had he added 'it's you dad' or any other sensible hint he would have saved his daughter years of suffering (and maybe a lifetime for himself when he realises this). And I don't even want to get into how ridiculous it is that he transmitted data by moving the hands on the watch, which was unaffected after being picked up, meaning it was hardly gravitational manipulation was it? What was the point of trying to be scientific and trying to explain it in this way then. If he could do that, he ought to have found a better solution that did not require his daughter 25 years to figure out. And anyway, they saved humanity by building this massive station named after his daughter (by that time they knew what he went through and they still named it after her?). Why couldn't they have done the same thing on Earth? Just build the same goddamn station on Earth without needing to harvest their gravitational energy bullsh*t, bam, humanity saved in the same way. Grand ideas don't make great movies if you can't deliver them properly... It is atrocity to compare this to Kubrick's masterpiece...Waste of money... My honest rating would be 6 for that movie but I rated it 1 to balance the "emotional" ratings. Cast and the part with Matt Damon were good. The rest was a bad combination of Gravity, 2001: A Space Odyssey, a bit Mr. Nobody in the wrap of a lot of useless drama... If you have a thinking mind which does not surrender to the dirty drama games of the commercial script writers then your brain cells will hurt like a b... after seeing that much nonsense. Unfortunately, that is the destiny of almost all movies playing with the time concept except the Back to the Future trilogy. What concerns me more than the quality of the movie itself is the number of blown-up ratings threatening the credibility of IMDb, which I always trust. Who are you people? Some fake rating generator AI? Thousands of people voting for 1$ per day? Last words: Don't go! They don't deserve your money because they did not put enough effort to create a meaningful story and I would accept any meaning in its own logic.#11 All-Time. . .Seriously? The universe is full of fascinating facts. It's mind-bending to contemplate, for example, the awesome size of our galaxy. Light travels 186,000 miles per second and yet it takes 100,000 years for a single beam of light to cross the entire Milky Way Galaxy. And our galaxy, to quote Carl Sagan, is only one among billions and billions. The vastness of space truly is stunning. But thanks to a "worm hole" the folks in Interstellar leave the Milky Way in a cosmic snap of the fingers. And yet, having just achieved this most amazing of all feats, our heroes are pretty much bored to tears. Instead, everybody is more concerned with some father/daughter relationship that wasn't developed in the first place. Look, if you're going to make a movie that purports to explore the fascinating mysteries of the universe, then do it! Have some wonderment in the story. Dazzle me not only with visuals, but with amazement at the astonishing scope of our universe. And why not produce a script that obeys the laws of astrophysics, or at least some theories thereof? This movie takes something that would dwarf the Apollo lunar missions and turns it into some ridiculous "Plan A/Plan B" tediousness. I suggest instead watching "Through the Wormhole" with Morgan Freeman or re- watching "2001: A Space Odyssey." Heck, even "Contact" with Jodie Foster is far more entertaining and imaginative than Interstellar.  And yet. . .9.2 stars! I'm not saying 10-star reviews on this site are phony; after all, major film critics also are raving about Interstellar. Unfortunately, I find most professional film critics about as credible as the physics in this movie. Frankly, Interstellar is a boring movie! And if that puts me in the vast minority of reviewers, fine, I can live with that. Because I have minimum standards when I pay $11 for admission and $8.50 for large popcorn. Stay home and read a good book instead, or just gaze out at the night sky and reflect on our amazing universe.Ridiculous this movie was awful, I was deceived by the fake rating. it was full of pseudoscience, so superficial and boring. every single minutes could be challenged by a science professional. being a PhD student in science, I envy SciFi script writers and directors that they can pop up any bullshit and be praised by non-professional audience. such a ridiculous robot, underground NASA that launches billion dollar projects in famine a condition, the huge tide on that planet without considering the depth of water, entering the black-hole unprotected, LOVE being the 5th dimension, contacting through black-hole by pushing the books! Oh my! can anybody be more superficial about science? my advice to anybody who has a critical mind: don't waist your time.Confused and shaky in delivering the message In the opening night, I walked out from the movie theater, totally disappointed to see one of my favorite directors has diminished himself to such a low lever of performance. Poorly developing plot, immature explanation of astrophysics, unbelievable and unrelated events and characters, especial effects leveled to a Disney comedy, and horrible music are only parts of my negative impression.  Even Mathew McConaghey did not seem believable looking at her daughter, older than himself. Mat Damon probably did his career's worst acting. The robot was another annoying part. What did Anne Hathaway and two other guys add to the story? Using a laptop to bring down a drown and control an inter-galaxy spaceship??? Finding a livable planet after passing through the worm hole, in "another galaxy" seemed easier than finding an ATM machine in a US interstate highway.  Why would a director hire a "Black-Hole-World-Expert" as an executive producer to explain a worm hole function by drawing a line on a paper and punch it with a pencil? Just reading the worm hole article in Wikipedia would give you much more sophisticated knowledge. Mr. Nolan looked completely confused in delivering a solid message: Awareness of climate changes, saving human species, teaching relativity theory to common movie goers, or the power of love. Each of them bold and superficial.Boring Hollywood SOAP OPERA I am wondering if the people who write "intertstellar" 10-star reviews are actually sane, or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely deprived of everything that is sci-fi. Basically if the sic-fi component - most of which does not really happen until the end - is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic Hollywood soap opera. The worn-out rag of clich√© family relations, all- American-dad, "complicated" love affair, unruly and a classic tomboy-girl, co-workers (more like co-idiots) who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally, you know, to "up the ante"... it really makes up 90% of this movie. Up until half- way trough I honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director. There are also very obvious holes in the plot, and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sic-fi movies at least try to amend somehow. I can not help but think that after watching Automata which was a breath of fresh air in many regards, this movie is like walking into a small toilet where someone just took a huge dump. It is literally that bad. What saves this movie by the skin of its teeth is the ending. So just watch that instead, because until then you could have just as well been watching an episode of Santa Barbara. Spolers about ridiculous plot holes (as if the soap part of the movie is not stressed enough): 1) The stupid Dust Bowl recycled. Seriously? I am not even going to try to explain this because I'd need to re-post have of Wikipedia here, but it does not work that way. Not in the past - not in the future. 2) The moment NASA abducts the main character and daughter and questions them. Seriously? Maybe they should also have shot them on sight? 3) NASA's facility is top secret! Right... in the age supposedly after the present, when there are drones and google maps, they manage to hide a huge facility in some old James Bond villain fashion. 4) "LET'S GO TO ANOTHER GALAXY!". OK if the movie shows a fairly conventional rocket, carrying a futuristic "shuttle", WHY for the love of all holy would anyone risk going there - instead of looking in our own? What, they really expected to have better luck there - than in our own? They already searched the entire Milky Way? And what's even better - it "just so happens" there is a planet like a stone's throw away from the black hole and is NOT being consumed by it, and somehow a black hole which is now proved to be a collapsed star is anything BUT a collapsed star? Why... let's just start diving down toilets, because you know, they are not full of s*** but are actual doorways to different dimensions! Like dimensions of dementia perhaps! 5) Saving the best for last - I did like the ending. Despite its absurdity I did like it. Almost cried - if I were a 14 year old girl with especially fragile psychology, but I digress. The "machine" that allows the main character to conviniently contact his daughter in the future- past, is built by... the very humanity he is trying to save, that survived, and built the machine in the future. Lord have mercy, I will try to explain this... So basically if we consider all major theories about time travel, in order to change the future one must go there and change it, right? But here the future changes the past, and that past is what changed the future with the help of the future that is changed in the past with the changed future's help. Mind &gt;&gt;&gt; blown!Massively overrated (or over-retarded) I liked Inception a lot and was expecting something similar from Nolan brothers, but Interstellar turned out to be massively disappointing. It's too long, too boring, too sloppy and too hard to believe what all fuss is about. Earth is overpopulated and plants are dying from drought, dust is everywhere and starting to be a problem. This is all what we were told by a movie, everything that we should know (they think). So instead of trying to solve these problems by inventing new food forms, by ocean water demineralization or just soft decreasing of population to numbers Earth can sustain best minds came up with ingenious plan - go through suddenly discovered wormhole and see what happens. Instead of sending drones they sent bunch of people through to a no-return mission, three having reported of habitable planet each. It is when things started to become interesting. NASA picks up some random guy pilot (McConaughey) to lead mission to these three planets, all of them coincidentally in the same system, orbiting a black hole. COME ON, three planets orbiting a black hole? If you want to live here, you might be insane. However, in a retarded fashion he decides to leave his young daughter on dying earth to pursue his all-life-mission. Some more absurd plot decision happens when he then decide to land planet with such twisted space-time (because it is near blackhole, remember - we are watching movie pretending to make sense scientifically) that it has time accelerated 60000 times comparing to earth.  Nothing very interesting happens next, three non-essential persons just die, Matt Damon being one of them by going nuts for absolutely no reason. In the end McConaughey diving into a black hole (finally making sense sequence) leaving only one woman in a mission (Hathaway) to land a planet she wanted first were her supposed lover landed previously. And while soundtrack plays loudly to draw attention from following absurd plot twist, main hero spends 60 years in another dimension translating quantum equations to his daughter on Earth which will solve all problems and allow six billions people to escape. By the way all these years everyone was just waiting, absolutely no one bothered to send more expeditions so busy they were all solving Einstein equations. Why so silly? With so many numerous big and small plot holes this can't be serious movie. Main hero acting like a retard (or actually he is), his daughter soon-big-girl solving biggest scientific problem in history, two absolutely useless crew members with funny robot as a company and a woman supposed to be main-hero's girlfriend, a lier as main scientist and a bunch of another useless people. Even CGI can not save the day. We were told that black hole CGI supposed to be most realistic than ever, but it was pictured in roughly 1.5 scenes at best. Soundtrack is fine, but it is played so loudly, in disharmony with deep space atmosphere and in some scenes being unnecessary as well.  So what we have in the end? It just looked like they tried to make big, really BIG move about space travel and physic phenomenons, but somehow missed big picture and not really payed attention to the details, ignoring common sense which eventually led to a failure. Sadly, good opportunity to create such movie in the uncharted territory was wasted.Interbollo..s Interstellar by Christopher Nollan Reviewed by Svetoslav Grigorov First, I had to look at the score on www.IMDb.com to confirm that all the rumors were true (9 out of 10): me and Paul were the only ones who didn't like this movie and left 45 minutes before it had finished. Whatever that means I can assure you that I was/am still sober and I am not a zombie like the rest of the crowd in the Kettering Odeon cinema. Secondly, I would like to ask how all these critics made the comparison(s) with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and thirdly, please you who now read this review tell me that I am not the only one in my dullest disappointment for the year. Tell me that I haven't lost my marbles, tell me that you were enthralled from this copy of a House On The Prairie and if you think that this is the best movie of your life (or at least 2014), the only answer I can think of is: that's why so many rubbish movies have been released lately. Because the level of the quality has fallen drastically and the conveyor belt of the movie industry is catastrophic for the senses.  OK, so straight to the point. First 45 minutes we are introduced to the farming, dust and the coming famine problems, nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, Earth is doomed, father and daughter found a super-secret location that NASA strategically placed for their eyes only. We see a lot of corn and even the nineties Children of The Corn was a better shallow slasher while this one turns out to be an American clich√©d space marmalade, and my best fitting comparison for it is Armageddon which is not really a movie, but a joke. Wormholes, saving of the human kind, bringing resources, planting/replanting, Plan A /Plan B, frozen embryos to colonize a distant world, overcoming gravity, scientists and even a quantum physics and so much camera- philosophy that Kubrick will turn in his grave, daddy-please-don't-go-to-space-cause ‚ÄìI'm- gonna-cry, bam the watch on the floor (I don't wanna see you anymore), counting while going into the stratosphere, Lego-robot which somehow was better acting than the rest of the actors or at least was more fun. Wait, wait, did I say actors? Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine (The rest of them are not worth mentioning apart from the crying daughter Murph who did her best job). Matthew McConaughey has one of the most annoying twangs ever and his jaundiced bad- version-face of Paul Newman cannot contribute to any script lately (let's not forget that without the help of Jared Leto and his masterful transformation in The Dallas Buyers Club his Oscar was going to hell). His mumbling could be understood only from the villagers in Kentucky and what he is on about¬ÖSeriously, I needed subtitles to comprehend his actor's efforts in such a "serious" movie. How serious this movie was! I pushed myself to read couple of the 'serious' critical reviews and they had the audacity to call it "scientific"??? Oh man, poor Anne Hathaway who looked sometimes at the camera and was likely apologizing for the mess she was in. I felt sorry for her. The script was the hell of the hells. Such nonsense with no credibility and no creativity at all. Total zero or even below the zero. As I said we left long before the end because my time is precious. I will open Isaac Asimov's (or Stanislaw Lem's) short stories and will be engulfed in characters and situations, so my brain will be given food for thought while all these poor people are going to see Interbol..cks and will be exposed on the radiation of a mediocrity (yes, I felt cheated like someone was trying to insult me). Well, if you who now read this review respect yourself and really like Kubrick, Moon, Gravity (and even Contact) and other good sci-fi don't waste your time and save your money. Today we wasted ¬£40 including the drinks, the popcorn and the tickets and the only thing that I was inspired for was my generated anger for this text. My verdict on the scale from 1 to 10 is to give ONE for the director Christopher Nolan who needs a little encouragement and I am hoping he will not slip into the shoes of M. Night Shyamalan who have crafted a lot of rubbish lately as you know. God forbid that never happens. P.S.Don't tell me that I have sat there for 2 (it's actually 169 minutes) hours of a film and it had a great ending cause I don't want know.why everybody is wrong and this is a really bad movie OK, this is a rant. For perspective: I love movies/see everything in the theater/can enjoy almost all movies/love scifi. But I hated Interstellar! This movie makes nooo sense. Technoscience babble on Star Trek knows is makes no sense, Interstellar tries to make you belief it has a scientific bases, it does not! It rapes hearsay on about a dozen theories, but it's like a five year old read Hawking and then explains it to a retarded dog! I'm not even gonna say spoilers ahead, because spoiling something inherently means ruining something good, no chance of that here! First of, apparently there was a world war, people many died... but somehow with a reduced world population there was still not enough food, so everybody had to become a farmer.... seriously? that alone is a crappy premise that makes no sense. Bcs it's not like they are doing it manually! They have frigging robot harvesters. Also, no MRI scanners, but apparently we still harvest fossil fuels to keep 50 year old trucks going. There is a plague that kills crops....but apparently not tress/grass/bushes/ and other assorted plant life, just the edible ones. A dust bowl you say.... really bad production when in the shot the window still is full of dust, the wall boards 10 cm next to it are clean.... Also, in the car: masks on, in an old wooden rickety house, take them off... Man shows up at secret NASA base...oh what a coincidence, you used to be a NASA pilot , we're your old buddies! By the way TOMORROW! we are launching our only rocket. You can pilot it bcs our crew has only done simulators where as you flew it...once....10 years ago.... WTF!?!? This crew and you will spend 10 years together on a mission, but we don't need to do a medical check, psych profile OR even refresh our memory, just show up tomorrow dude! We launch into space, OK we need to dock with the big ship, switch to manual...uhhm, why would you do that????? Well we've been in technological dark ages for 50 years, but hey look we did happen to invent cryostasis! how convenient! We're on a spaceship with limited room, but your cryochamber for some inexplicable reason has to go down into the floor , why? we'll it looks cool of course! At this point we're only like 45 minutes into the friggin thing! So I'll speed up: Planets orbit a black hole, or only one does? where is the sun that is providing light, why doesn't it get sucked in? It's not OK to have the ship experience 7 years time delay, but the shuttle is OK. Big wave smashes shuttle on rocks, no damage! You were gone for 23 year, I didn't think you were coming back, but instead of continuing the mission I decided to sit on my ass and watch the black hole. Frozen floating clouds. Homicidal Matt Damon. Robots that are absolutely ridiculous.... really really really ridiculous...like lost in space ORIGINAL TV did it better. Robots walk in way that is not possible, take 4 pieces of wood and find out for yourself. Nothing escapes a black hole, not even light, but we can send in the droid and it can send out a signal... Also, black hole does give of light apparently. Somehow girl's part is bad acting both as a kid as well as an adult. CONSISTENCY AT LAST! We don't have enough fuel to visit 2 planets, but now we do, so everything is OK. Many years time delay,wake up on space station. Go back to help new colony, also time delayed, don't worry bcs we didn't bother to send anybody else the the last 100 friggin years. BLLEERGGHHHHHPretty disappointing... Like many other reviewers, I'm giving this a 1 in a feeble attempt to balance out all the unwarranted 10s I keep seeing, even though I really think it deserves a 5, or maybe a 6. I actually created an account just to do this, so I figured I might as well include a review along with my rating. Many will say try to tell you that you shouldn't attempt to compare this movie to 2001, that they are two totally different movies, etc. This is ridiculous; they are quite similar on multiple levels, with Interstellar obviously taking many cues and inspirations from Kubrick's masterpiece. I feel that if we compare the two, we can get a good idea of where Nolan's film went wrong. The main reason 2001 has remained so powerful and held up so well is that it doesn't try to explain and rationalize everything that happens. We see the events of the movie unfold, but as the movie nears its psychedelic conclusion, we are really left to our own guesswork as to what is going on. Has he entered another dimension? An alternate universe? An alien spacecraft? Is he just dead? The mere fact that we have no idea whether this scene depicts something spiritual, something scientifically quantifiable, or a mix of the two makes it so much more moving than if Kubrick had tried to explain it through the available science of his time. Interstellar answers far too many questions, which, as is often the case, ends up raising infinitely more. Nolan makes it clear from the get go that this film is supposed to function on more of an emotional level than a scientific one. Then why even bother have the film "fact checked" by a astrophysicist? Why create this confusing mixture of real- and pseudo- science in the first place? To me, in a lot of scenes this kind of shatters the air of mysticism Nolan seemed to be going for. The "floating bookcase in a black hole" sequence, for instance, seemed really magical until Cooper suddenly has a bunch of epiphanies and becomes positive that the structure was created by future humans, not aliens, that they created it specifically for him so he could navigate 5D and communicate with his daughter, and that he can save the world only by manipulating a watch with gravity. BOOM. There goes all the mystery. And lets assume his theory is correct, and this structure was indeed constructed by mankind from the future. Hmmm, guess it turns out that we didn't perish from constant dust storms after all‚Äîinstead we survived hundreds of thousands of years into the future and went on to create mind-blowing, interdimensional space technology. Then what exactly is future us so worried about? They seem to be doing just fine without any alteration of the past. This is just the tip of the iceberg as far as far as all of the inconsistencies and unanswered questions you'll find in this movie. If you have a very analytical mind, steer clear of it‚ÄîI am not a mathy or science-y person by any stretch, yet even I struggled at times to put my logic in the backseat and just enjoy the ride. That's what I'd advise you to do if you want to have a good time watching this movie: DON'T OVERTHINK IT. If you can just do that, you'll find an entertaining film with truly stunning visual effects, a great (if maybe a LITTLE too over the top) score from HZ, and very convincing performances from the actors. I found some scenes very moving. I liked the concept of a future that, as a result of a technological lull, doesn't look very different from our present. There are a lot of positive things to say about this film, and yet the end result is, sadly, maybe just a couple pegs above mediocre.2hr 45min of Perfection!!! I wanted to write a review for so long, but had to take my time to come up with the right words. I am doing this partly for self-preservation but mainly due to the sheer brilliance which the film offers. I am very happy to be able to witness this masterpiece and sad at the same time knowing that we might have to wait long to witness another film like Interstellar. My obsession started almost 12 years ago, when Interstellar was listed on Steven Spielberg's filmography with a synopsis saying exploring Wormholes, Time-Dilation, Interstellar travel and everything else which Kip Thorne's theories explores! I was watching this space like a hawk, only it never moved past that one dedicated page on IMDB.  Almost 12 years later, Spielberg opts out and Christopher Nolan steps in and the project kicks off. I was actually surprised on how quickly they pulled this off. Stuck in development for over a decade and then gets completed in just a year, that is amazing speed. However, I was a bit sceptical especially after reading the leaked script on IMDB which included Chinese robots on far abandoned planet with gravity controlling devices, etc. it seemed like containing strong doses of sci-fi and less of the theories which could be possible one day. But thank god, the script was just a decoy and the movie takes the right direction. It brilliantly explores the possibilities of interstellar travel at the same time keeping the nature and relationships which human's share at its core. Now that is quite the balance and with such complex script, if done wrongly, this movie could have been a disaster. But Christopher Nolan helms this with utter confidence and brings in the master composer, Hans Zimmer on board. Zimmer delivers the most brilliant and original score which perfectly gels with every scene, every sentence spoken and every silent and non-silent moment. It's really a shame that this man did not win an Oscar since Lion King even after being nominated for gems like Sherlock Holmes, Inception and Dunkirk. I don't think anyone else could have done a better job for Interstellar. I really want Nolan and Zimmer to make Interstellar 2!! Coming to the movie, I really don't want to talk about the plot as this is done in every other piece written about this movie, instead I would like to state why I was in awe for the entire run-time. I always was a huge fan of science-fiction, both "Star Wars" kind and "Contact" kind. There is always something fascinating about not just mentally visualising but actually seeing things which probably are not going to be possible in our lifetime. Travelling through a worm-hole and entering another galaxy is right on top of that list. And this film does that so brilliantly that there is no room for wanting more. Kip Thorne's presence as a scientific adviser solidifies the liberties which the film can take. So Interstellar has the right doses of science and science-fiction blended together.  Time-Dilation was another concept which I eager to see after watching an episode of Brian Cox explaining theory of relativity. This is brilliantly portrayed in the film when the team visits Miller's planet. An hour there equals 7 Earth years. Wow, scientists must have lost their minds when Einstein stated and verified this theory in 1905!!  Another thing which Interstellar and many other films take for granted and show simplistically are the hibernation pods. Sleeping and waking up in one piece after decades/centuries opens up so many wonderful possibilities. Wish that was as simple and real as these films portray. I know we just perfected the "Sleeping" bit but the waking up process if for future mankind. Wish we could get there sooner. And then the epic Event Horizon and Singularity. This is where the films takes its liberties for dramatisation purposes. Still it is exciting visualising time as a physical dimension and being able to scroll through one's time-line as if it was the songs list on our iPhones! So Interstellar satisfies all our wildest space-exploration dreams, in the most realistic way possible and for this reason alone, this film will be number one spot on my list!  Coming to the cast, everyone fits like a glove to the script. I loved Matthew McConaughey in Contact and he does the same brilliant job here as well, bringing all his on-screen charisma. Other noteworthy mentions are Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain, they played their parts to utmost perfection. And Of-course Mackenzie Foy, who played the younger role of Murph with finesse.  Finally, this movie is as good as realistic sci-fi gets and we might have to probably wait for a long time to witness another epic like this. Sigh!!Best science movie I've ever watched This movie is the only sci-fi movie where I felt that was more a science movie than a science fiction movie. It also made me think a lot about some of its content, even though most of its content is not real I really felt that it was related to real scientific topics that are very interesting.Interpersonal Nice movie to interact with and then at some point let go and let your inner ponder and wonder out. Cause and effect is displayed very well in this movie making it a good movie to see again just to sip it like fine wine. The earth is dying but mankind has other plans and so it goes with twists, turns and mysteries mixed with human nature hope and space exploration. This is where it gets interesting. Of planets there are no end but what kind are they? This movie touches on that. We learn that Earth is perfect as planets go because everything fits so nicely and holds for billions of years and supports multi-life forms (diversity) which boggle the mind. Finding this elsewhere is not that easy even if you have trillions of choices as we are led to believe in this movie. Good entertainment, visuals and who doesn't like a good space story mixed with time elements plus mankind is running out of time movie? Here it is. make this....Intercomet! Stay home and read a good book instead, or just gaze out at the night sky and reflect on our amazing universe.A Masterpiece Best of all is the sound track by Hans Zimmer. This is my new favourite movie and I seriously can't wait to watch it again. And I cannot for the life of me understand all the negative 1 star reviews. Oh how we humans are so different.A Sci-Fi masterpiece added in Nolanography. I've written and read many reviews but when it comes to Nolan, his work is needed to be appreciated always. I really loved the plot of the movie and direction of Nolan (no doubt). This has been always said that Nolan always does his full research to the very extent and by seeing Interstellar he proved this statement. The role of cooper is very well played by Matthew McConaughey. He did it so well that at the end of the movie you may fell his aggression and frustration. The direction of the movie is so well that no one can take their eyes off fro the screen. The concept of dimensions, gravity, time differences and worm holes are very well explained. The use of CGI is so good that you may see it as real. I do and always will love the work of Christopher Nolan.Beautifully written and casted I absolutely love this film. I'm also a fan of Christopher Nolan's films. This movie was genius, the way it was written. The visual effects blow my.mind. I find myself rewinding it every time they go through to the other galaxy.. also, when Cooper ejects his craft and ends up in between I don't know what to call it, I try to imagine myself in that position. Even I, just watching it, was panicked seeing him watching himself leave his daughter from another dimension. The only thing I didn't like was how his character was made to never see his children again. I felt like he didn't have enough emotion towards the realization that he was possibly never going to see them again. I mean ,I'd be crying and freaking out from up there. Of course he had to focus on the problem at hand, but he missed their whole lives. And it didn't seem as if he was remorseful enough in the end when he watched murp on her death bed..I would never have left. I mean, after not seeing her for 23yrs, I'd have talked to her about what really happened and apologize over and over. But that's the way it was written. Of course he actually helped save the world by Morse coding to murph via another dimension with Tars help, but he should have been able to return to earth with his children..on the other hand, it is refreshing to see a movie without happy endings. You know, where the audience is left surprised. Where things don't always work out. A typical ending would be, they returned to earth, he gets back to his kids and they save the world. This movie was awesome because it didn't work that way. But it still bothered me. His daughter and son had a life without him. It's saddening. Didn't like that feeling, but it happens. A very beautiful film.guyz ignore haterz just watch Nolan masterpiece I just wanna say thank to god for give us men like a nolan sir really  what a great movie dude..after half n hour you just forget who we are man?? salute to nolan brothers really... _/\_ ignore spoilers reviews just watch it nowBEST MOVIE EVER This movie is so good! Production, storyline, action everything! This is Nolan's best picture for sure. The ideia of what's behind the wormhole it's what I am going to believe until a 100% answser from science. In addiciton I would like to say that Chistopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer make the best team ever. This movie is perfect! 5/5Brilliant! Amazing movie. As a lover of Star Trek, et al. this has been a refreshing breath of fresh air!Best ever. For an obvious reason every time i watch this movie i get goosebumps.Another Christopher Nolan masterpiece I'll say a number of things about Interstellar but basically ... words fail me. This is one h*** of a movie. Even though it has some flaws, or at least certain things that bother me a bit, I find this film so absorbing from start to finish that I just can't resist giving it 10/10. Big-screen, big ideas, big-budget, terrific technology, a script that's not dumbed down, and a stacked cast. And the run time of almost 3 hours has not a single wasted minute -- it's not at all too long for its seamlessly interlocked plot to unfold. Everything is here -- gut-wrenching personal tragedies and triumphs, visual spectacle like nothing before, high drama, inspirational striving against huge odds, and all delivered by actors in total command. If you don't read any further, I hope this is already enough to persuade you to see it (or see it again!). TIFF was playing both Interstellar and 2001: A Space Odyssey this past month so I went in to see it in their beautiful theater space again, three years after its first release. The pro critics would see 2001 (from 1968) as its logical predecessor, and to some extent it certainly is. But it also owes a lot to 2010: The Year We Make Contact (from 1984) in its pure and accurate depiction of space travel. (As one example, take the sequence in Interstellar showing their arrival at Saturn, and compare it with 2010's arrival at Jupiter and the atmospheric braking technique. Both are visually magnificent.) But there are things in Interstellar that are entirely its own, such as the scenes of the black hole with accretion disk, its NON-singular center (a nonrotating black hole has a singular point of infinite density at its center, but a spinning black hole actually does not!), the stretching of time in a strong gravitational field, and the outside view of the wormhole with its gravitationally lensed images of galaxies on the far side. During the production it became well known that Nolan was (intelligently) relying on consultation with Kip Thorne, a theoretical astrophysicist and specialist in gravity and spacetime, and it showed. Maybe Thorne didn't get an Oscar for this work, but I'm sure he'll make do with his Nobel Prize. :) There's so much here that is done right, all the way down to the simple fact that the views outside the various spacecraft are utterly silent no matter if their thrusters are firing or they are colliding -- sound doesn't exist in a vacuum, period.  The cast list is just amazing: Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, John Lithgow, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, and a wonderful Mackenzie Foy as 10-year-old "Murph" (under certain camera angles and lighting, she and Chastain as her older self look uncannily alike). Every one of them has an essential role to play in this rich and complex script. Also worth noting: thankfully it's becoming common enough now for a woman scientist to play a major role in SF and other films, but it's still very rare to have MORE than one. Here we've got both Hathaway (biologist) and Chastain (physicist), and their characters are both key players and heroes in their own right. And the advanced-AI robots on the spacecraft are predictably charming, but thankfully do NOT steal the show. This is an ensemble cast all the way through. Hans Zimmer's musical score is quite distinctive, even for him. I particularly liked the elegant dance-like motif that accompanies spacecraft travel scenes among others -- it's a gently soaring, yearning line of song that just ... never... quite ... resolves or comes to rest. On the other hand, he has a couple of suitably massive themes for the big dramatic buildups that pack a real punch. OK, for the things that bothered me a bit:  the 'tesseract library' at the center of the black hole and the transmission of signals across time by manipulating gravity: I know it's ingenious, but it is just a bit hard to swallow. I keep wondering if there was a better way to do this, but I'll admit I can't think of one.   the ships would have been ripped apart going into the black hole; the tidal field around a stellar-mass b.h. is too steep for anything solid to maintain its structure.   with Earth's resources dwindling and monoculture crops catastrophically failing one after the other, how come everyone still drives cars and trucks everywhere? Where is the gas coming from?  These are quibbles though. The powerful storyline and first rate production quality trump everything else. A modern classic.A great visual spectacle! This is one of those films that you HAVE to see in theaters. The soundtracks really made it feel like you were inside the film, being one of the characters and really caring for the events that take place in the film. The acting was solid as well, I've always been a fan of Matthew Mcconaughey and the chemistry with the other cast members felt real to me. If you ever get the chance to watch this in theaters, do so! - You will not be disappointed.Mind blowing You feel emotional about this movie that's the first thing the first reason makes this movie great this besides another reasons this movie has the best mind-blowing ending and bending in all the time this movie show you how the directors could use his all abilities and all elements he have to give you a great work10/10 Review (1~5) #Content: Script 5 | Acting 5 | Cinematography 5 | Film Editing 5 #Visual: Costume Design 5 | Makeup &amp; Hairstyling 5 | Scenic Design 5 | Lighting 5 | Visual Effects 5 #Sound: Score &amp; Soundtracks 5 | Sound Editing &amp; Mixing 5 #Overall (1~10): 10Terrible soundtrack Worst sound ever... music so loud you have trouble hearing the spoken words. Fix it or dump it. The plot would be interesting if it could be heard. The acting is well done if they could be heard. Turn down the music and turn up the voice. I will never understand the choice to keep the music and sounds louder than the words. Total frustrating.Completely amazed I have to admit that the first time I saw this movie, was not completely engaged. I felt that in some how the last part was forced to conclude the film in a very different way the film was being directed. I thought that the immersive, technically accurate and emotional first part didn't correspond to the final acts. But after seeing this a few more times, I think the end is precisely what Nolan wanted for his film. It is emotionally driven and sometimes not everything can be explained with physics. This is a masterpiece and for me the scene where Matt Damon tries to dock in the Endurance is the best action scene I've seen in many years. Acting is really good, specially McConaughey, Hathaway and Caine, bringing into life some memorable characters. However there are some minor flaws, no one can compare to the strengths of this movie. I recommend you to search for videos explaining how Nolan and his team draw for the first time a black hole using the physics law, or how they filmed the first planet full of water. Those kind of attention to detail will give you an idea when a Director is really loving what he does. Just sit and enjoy the ride.One of the best movie ever made A truly masterpiece. Visually outstanding, great acting especially from Matthew McConaughey! Hans Zimmer composed probably the best Soundtrack ever for a film. Not to mention the great writing and incredible storytelling from the Nolan brothers. It is very suspenseful, creative, exciting, astonishing, and emotional.Best space movie I can bravely say that this is best space movies that's produced,and the music by Hans Zimmer proves why he is the best,the length of the film is 2 hr 48 minutes but never feels slow. personally my favorite movie of Christoper Nolan is Interstellar In this film there is a scene on docking ,its one of the best scenes and Hans Zimmer's music in that is just awesome to the coreMany 1 Star Reviewers Didn't Get It I saw this movie when it came out and recently returned to it after watching Passengers (a pretty good movie). I wanted to respond to some of the 1 star reviews. Many of them say the science is wrong, but they probably don't understand the science. Most of the fantastical stuff this movie is based on current theories (e.g. that worm holes would appear as a sphere). These theories may or may not end up being correct, or feasible as used in this movie, but it's based on ideas from a brilliant theoretical physicist. It's a deep, complex movie, and I got lost a couple times during my initial viewing. e.g. when Cooper went into the tesseract I thought it was too strange at the time (and it broke the suspension of disbelief), but later realized what was supposed to be happening.  So perhaps things could have been made a little clearer for the audience so it was easier to follow. And there's a few other things that keep it from being perfect. But it's incredibly ambitious and the atmosphere was really great.Ambitious, Powerful and Inspiring. A movie so ambitious and foresightful, it leaves the viewer wondering about the inevitable future of the human race while also inspiring some to take a deep interest in physics. I recommend everyone to watch the movie because you will all leave with something to take away from the film.One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Do not skip this movie. It is on of the best I have seen in a long time. I am not a word-smith and cannot do this film justice by trying to describe why you need to watch it. Just know, if you have not seen this movie yet, stop reading reviews and start watching!!! This film made me laugh, and cry. As a father I can imagine what Mathew M. is going through, the joy the pain, the need to protect those you love. This film will appeal to most. From us Science Fiction geeks, to people who want a great drama. We can all sit down and appreciate this film. Now stop reading and go watch already!A piece of art. I am shocked of how amazing the movie is. I literally have no words. I don't even want to talk about the small issues, since the story line tops all of them. A great combination between the real and unreal. Between the possible and the impossible. Between the things we know and the things we don't know. A great acting and great feelings for a dad. No much words to say, i advice everyone over 18 to watch this movie.Amazing!!! A grand yet close to home space opera which stands as my favorite film of all time. Every aspect to which makes a film enjoyable for me is met. Sci fi. check. Killer soundtrack.check. science fact theories. check. killer quotes check. imaginative themes. check. what if factor. check. dark themes. check. educational. check. imax compatible. check. challenges viewers. check. Nolan brings to life one of the best sci fi movies ever. It starts a great conversation and left me sad. the suggestive elements and theories implemented changed my outlook on space exploration, time, and environmental issues. He made space into a big scary untamable beast with obstacles such as time and gravity. A lot can be taken from this film making it an all time classic/must see. thanks for delivering Nolan. I cant wait to see what he does next. Inception used to be my #1 all time favorite until he decided to tickle my astronomy fascination even the title makes it my cup of tea. Favorite scene is the first water planet they land on. Truly horrific and begins the conflict.Must See! Great film. Phenomenal Soundtrack. Insanely talented cast. Watch watch watch Great film. Phenomenal Soundtrack. Insanely talented cast. Watch watch watch!Great film. Phenomenal Soundtrack. Insanely talented cast. Watch watch watch Great film. Phenomenal Soundtrack. Insanely talented cast. Watch watch watch!A Puzzle to be Solved Interstellar is one movie you can never forget. The movie is mind bending and gets you thinking. The idea was marvelously thought out and deserves to be seen by many. There are twists, ups, downs, and even sides to sides. Enough to keep you on the edge of your seat! Watch Interstellar and watch this movie blow you away!A film I wish I loved As someone who loves sci fi, esepcially philosophical sci-fi, I was looking forward to interstellar. And for the first half of the movie I was ready to call it a masterpiece. It was engaging and ejoyable on a surface level, but it also had great themes. I can't call the cinematography anything less than perfect, the score less than entrancing and the performances less then great. The writing is scientifically accurate and well defines the Murph family, but everyone else is given typical Nolan characteristics, in that there too serious to have a personality. But that didn't bother me too much. The whole concept of Cooper having to, in a way choose between his family and the whole universe is interesting and explores human natural and love. It's just a shame then that they can't follow this theme through.  Then there is one particular scene. I believe it is after they enter the wave planet. Anne Hathaway talks about love, and how it is everything. This speech is my biggest problem with the movie. The film wants to suggest somehow that his love for his family is key to solving the crisis on Earth. This doesn't really make sense and is not deep. The whole love thing being important becomes very prevelant in the film, but I think it isn't deep at all. Love being important can be summarised in a sentence, but the importance of love can be analysed. It isn't. If you don't care about philosophical elements of the film that's fine but the film keeps bringing back to it. I can turn my brain off in a movie, but when you ask me to think and I think what you're saying is stupid, then you have made a mistake.  The whole ice planet scene and Matt Damon being introduced is just unneccessary. Yeah, Damon is the opposite to McCaughnehey in terms of ideals, but we don't need a villain. We don't need a fight scene and a villain like him. He's supposed to be a villain that we think is crazy but we ultimately find him to be relatable, however he just comes across as selfish. Wouldn't it be better if say Hathaway was constantly budding heads with Cooper, and then made a rash decision to try to go back to Earth that cost the crew and led to the docking scene? Rather than forced villain that prevents us from thinking and sympathising with his motives we would be able to philosiphise the situation.  The ending is what gets me the most. You've probably heard all the criticism. It being a huge Ex-Machina is not my problem (although it is definitely). I think the ending betrays what the movie was building up to. Instead of leading to an answer or something that gives us more clues or ideas, it leads us to a scene that is obviously meant to pointlessly 2001 style enter this new dimension and conclude that love controls and binds everything. How deep. The ending being an ex-machina doesn't bother me for it being a huge coincidence, but it really doesn't make sense to end like this. Although I don't like the time scene, it is a perfect way to end the movie. The audience anticipates an outcome that they think about. They think about the ending which the movie should do, but once we know everything, what do we think about?  I think the scene should've ended by showing Cooper reaching out to Murph to tell her to tell him not to go on the mission, and she responds, changing time in a way that is very vague so we don't really get what happens.  Human desires could be explored better, but I see them as only partially shown, in a way where I see essays written about them that I feel were evaluated after analysing every scene. If it is shown only a bit then we can't explore it, and as such it can't be as philosophical ad pure sci-fi as say the golden standard 2001. It is enjoyable, but that is all Interstellar will ever be to me. Good but not great.MASTERPIECE 'Interstellar' isn't just movie this is one of the Nolan's masterpieces. If you like sci-fi this is the best movie ever. Actors, Soundtracks, Moments everything is perfect. This is the first time I feel the movie. I watch it 10 times and I realize that if you want to get the movie, every detail of it, it is not enough to watch only once.  Hans Zimmer's melodies are just amazing, suggests every situation of the movie perfectly. Intensify moments and you feel like you are in the movie and start feeling movie, not watching.  Also this movie is about Communication between father and daughter, how they love each other, how they want to be together. Just watch this masterpiece!Best Sci-fi film I've ever seen! It's such a brilliant and profound idea to redefine the power of love to against scientific facts! Nolan totally nailed it!An Brilliant Movie I don't had the chance to see this movie before, just watched few days before and again i watched Interstellar yesterday. Wow what a make! Christopher Nolan sir again proved that he is the intelligent movie maker ever again. Every single frame of this movie is awesome. The emotion scene, when cooper returns to the ranger after escaping from the giant wave, learning that 23 years passed - was an amazing emotional sequence. What a acting! There is nothing confusing in this movie. Everything is clean and clear. The Wormhole, Black Hole Horizon, 5th dimensional world all are fantastic really fantastic. It is one of the best Sci-Fi movie.Simply an insult to cinema There is no better way to start this review but to say Interstellar is a disposable, useless undertaking of cinema that boldly challenges our endeavor for science but neglects the nature of pure cinema. Interstellar is the opposite of a masterpiece. It bombards you with loads of scientific exposition whilst it hides its story filled with plot holes and lazily written screenplay.Nolan's best In my opinion Nolan's best work. When a movie is better than the likes of Inception, The Prestige and The Dark Knight trilogy, that is saying something!The future of humanity I love the adventure, sacrifice, and special effects in this space traveling sci-fi! I hope there's a sequel!Really liked it! This is one of the most epic movies I have ever watched. The music, the acting, picture, story, everything was amazing! In my personal opinion this is a must-see movie.Masterful I personally love this movie. there were lots of things that were just so good and so little that was bad. The plot in this movie was phenomenal. Most people have already seen this movie so i wont lay out the plot. The acting from Matthew McConaughy, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and even Matt Damon was really good. Of course, since this is the acting section of my review, the smaller roles also did a good job in the movie. John Lithgow is by far one of my favorite actors in this movie. the person playing Coopers son was really good, and all three of the the people who played Murph were really good. they all helped to make an interesting world.  The set and costume design was exultant. The people back on earth had more advanced technology than us but at the same time it was less advanced. The spaceship, Millers planet, and Manns planet were also all well built and put together. The music, being designed for this movie, was overwhelmingly good. The sounds of space were also put in very well, since space has no sound, neither did the shots in space.  Matt Damon is my last point. He is by far one of my most hated actors because, among other things, I don't like him as a person or actor, but he did a really good job in this movie. not only that but the marketing for this movie was also phenomenal. He was not on any poster, in any trailer, or at any of the events surrounding this movie which made it for a tremendous surprise that he should up in this movie, for fans and non-fans alike.  I give this movie a solid 10/10 because i have enjoyed it so many times even after i understand all of it. The only flaw i can see in this movie is that it wants to be so much like 2001: A Space Odyssey but at the same time it doesn't. I fell like it made itself different enough though.Brilliant Watch I finally got round to watching this movie, 4 years after to came out and it definitely lived up to the hype! It's essentially a love story between a father and his children; and the guilt he carries with him whilst going on a mission across space and time, to help save a dying planet Earth. But with space's time relatively being warped, (after he's travelled through a black), every hour spent in this new galaxy, is equal to 7 years back on earth. And it fears he'll never make it back before his kids die, or even back at all.  There are lots of sub-plots to this film too, which I won't ruin. But to make it clear, this isn't a typical "lost in space movie". It's moving and sad at times! Which makes it a bloody good and unique sci-fi movie! The acting is also superb in the film, particular by Matthew McConnagy, Jessica Chastain and the young actress who plays Jessica, as a young kid. Brilliant sci-fi movie and the best I've see in years.A masterpiece ! An epic ! Reaching the stars and beyond ! Interstellar is a magnum opus on interstellar space travel by Christopher Nolan. While for many it may appear to be more like a science-fiction movie, the movie depicts one of the futuristic possibilities of the state of mankind, trying to explore and reach habitable planets in search of a second home. It shares its theme partially with another space fiction masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1961). The movie hits all the right chords with regards to depiction of emotion, passion, determination, desperation and sacrifice. The movie begins slow but gathers pace and steam as the plot uncovers, making sense of everything that happens. The audio-visual effects are simply mesmerizing and one of the best in recent times. And the science may surely be head-scratching for some. While for some the science of black holes, space-time and extra-dimensions may go over the head, but Nolan keeps it engaging nevertheless and leaves the audience in awe of the visuals and thrill of space adventure. The review of this movie shall be incomplete without the appreciation of the background score by Hans Zimmer. Emerging as one of the best partnerships in film industry, the combined geniuses of Nolan-Zimmer create goosebumps for sure.  This movie is a must watch for all, especially space and science enthusiasts. The viewer is sure to gain some insights into the cosmos, and engage in some healthy discussion about the Hows and Whys in the movie plot with co-viewers.not doing? If you have a family, you will doubt the choices of the main character. it will be a chalange for both sides to choose between the humanity and the family. and this will be a hard option. you will see the consequences and i do not believe i will choose the same ,maybe because i am not strong enough or else i am selfish. you will decide of your own durnig the movie and you will decide if you're strong enough... anyway, i love my child and i'm willing to be with her during her life.Rubbish I found this pretentious crap. After some 80 years of being addicted to movies and being a fan of Science Fiction from the days of Astounding and Galaxy, very few films have lived up to expectations. "2001"" the best of the lot. The mix of sugared family relations and hand-on-the wheels spaceship driving like a racing car plus some probably very expensive gadgetry was too boring for me, sorry, I did not last the fulll length and had to find my own wormhole like fast forward to the finish.Maybe One of the best movies I've seen, for the fantasy lovers. I watched movie at the cinema, in that moment I thought that this is the best movie I ever watched, sound effects fabulous, acting so good, effects are awesome and the story line is amazingWhat A Journey I watched this film twice at the cinema when it was released and many more times on Blu Ray since Each time I am taken on one amazing journey across the universe, yes the last 20 mins of the film is a bit bonkers but I didn't mind in the least.  As much as the film is about space travel we see the emotional journey and connection between father and daughter, and everytime I watch this I am moved by the pain both go through of being apart.  To me this is one of the best Sci Fi films made in recent yearsThink about the future today. One of the best Nolan's films. I love the message of this masterpiece! We definitely have to think about our future!Got an account just go give this movie 1/10 That's right. What an horrible movie. Don't know what's worse, the pathethic acting from almost everyone (Damon won the price tho for insignificant character) or the robots with graphics similar to "Cop" from 1988.  HOW can so much people enjoyed this? The first two hours is a total sleepfest, until the twist at the end where at least something happen that's interesting and not pointless.Incredible Film Nolan does it again. Incredible Visuals and a story with interesting characters to keep you hooked, truly a benchmark for sci-fi films! PLEASE WATCH!!!Good but not Great As far as cinematography and visuals, this movie was stunning. Whether it be on earth, in space, or an alien planet, you will be in awe of what you see. Gorgeous landscapes, horizons, and star fields never got old to look at. There wasn't a time in which I was disappointed with what I was taking in. The two "alien planets" in which we visit are detailed, intricate, and overall visually appealing. The ocean planet was impressive, and really was believable as a planet completely covered in water. The "Hoth" planet was also nice, giving us precarious ice cliffs, vasts deserts of barren snow, and frozen clouds. The whole movie I couldn't stop looking around the screen, and just thinking. "Damn." Acting performances. Apart from my somewhat dislike of Cooper's character, be it poor writing, or not-so-great acting, most of the roles in this movie are wonderfully acted. Also - SURPRISE! Matt Damon is in this movie! and so is Topher Grace! and Casey Affleck! I was pleasantly surprised each time a new cast member came out, performed by an actor that was nowhere to be seen on any promotional information or trailers. From a combination of the writing for most of the characters, and being well acted, there is very good character development and these characters help drive the plot. The big thing I got from this movie was emotions. emotions, emotions, emotions. I really felt for these people, and felt involved in this story. How about robots? I absolutely loved the robots in Interstellar. TARS being the "main" and CASE being another, just not quite as cheeky. All of the dialogue between these AI controlled monolith styled robots and the humans is wonderful. I loved the talk about changing there settings for humor and truth etc. From the beginning when TARS is first introduced, you feel uneasy about him. The way it walks...acts around people, talks naturally, and has an attitude, leads you to think that maybe he could be the typical "AHHH ROBOTS ATTACK" but this is not the CASE(Ha. Get it?). I digress...The design of these monolithic machines is fantastic. Their articulating and nearly fractal way that they can manipulate and interact was smart, and logical. Now we come to the part of the review where I complain. A lot. Plot holes. This movie is riddled with plot holes. Some minuscule, some big. From the beginning of the film, you are left wondering... While you don't necessary have to know the year it takes place, it just kept nagging in the back of my mind for the entirety that the film is focused on Earth. Another thing is the reason each selection of crops keeps dying. There was some word they were using, but I can't remember it. Despite the name they call it, they never fully explain what exactly it is, or why it's happening. Even just a blip of exposition would satisfy this massive question that really drives the whole movie. There's also reverse plot holes. (That's a thing, right? Maybe we could call them "Plot Wholes") There's a lot of extra time and exposition explaining things that...really aren't integral to the plot of the movie...or anything at all. The science in the movie also has holes...sometimes. For the most part, nearly all the science is sound. However there are some things that just aren't right, which I can for the most part let go of, for the sake of an easier to make movie, and more entertaining than a big science lecture(Which it also has plenty of, mind you). I won't go into detail about all the not-so-accurate science things, but some of the placement of planets around a black hole don't match up with what it would actually be like.  Near the end of the film, the plot decides to take a detour from the fairly logical and scientific stance most of the film has been. We get thrust into a black hole, and stretched out into another dimension, viewing time as a physical entity, as moving left and right. This is interesting...and explains a few questions I had had since the beginning. I wasn't a huge fan of this last 30 minutes or so, as it felt cheap and like they just rushed the last bit as they didn't know what to do(despite the movie being a whopping 3 hours long). I also had a bit of a problem with the fact that the "THEY" everyone was talking about throughout the film, made to seem like an alien race, was actually just highly evolved humans from the super future. Who changed the past, to let us go out and explore. and become highly evolved...to go back...you see where this is going. A PARADOX. Or just a use of the less used time travel idea that time is a circle and travelling in time is set, and what has happened, happened, and what will happen, will happen, no matter what. I could go on and on and on about too much emotion and bogged down story tropes and that bloody long run time, but that's enough mad ramblings for one post. Overall, I thought that this was a well rounded film. Visually stunning, scientifically interesting, and although there are some plot holes and a few less-than-stellar acting performances, this movie is sure to entertain. Especially viewed in it's native 70mm Imax.  Visuals: 10/10 Acting: 7/10 Writing: 6/10 Direction: 7/10 Overall: 7/10Pure perfection This movie is simply put the most brilliant piece of cinematography i have ever come across. Everything from the storytelling to the special effects are just mind boggling. Do yourself a favor and see it. You won't regret it.Best sci-fi movie I have ever seen Christopher Nolan is mu favorite director. And what I like about him is that his movies are very deep and emotional  Interstellar is a great movie built on a very complexe story . It has something special that other movies don't have like: The background music made by Hans Zimmer The great visual effects Special cast And many more... The script is very well written thanks to Jonathan Nolan . The development of the relationship between a father and his daughter makes the film even more intersting . It's full of suspense and mysteries  Christopher Nolan proved himself once more and Interstellar is an achievement that marked the sci-fi movies categoriesbuah Cada vez que la veo me explota la cabeza y no entiendo nada. me flipaThis is a masterpiece. This movie is one of the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it... I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. 10/10 for me.Did I miss something? Firstly, I am a big Nolan fan and love his previous work - The Prestige and Memento are in my books - story visually told as its best. I was excited about Interstellar, To tell a story about possibly the greatest adventure achieved by humans is no easy task. Can someone explain to an idiot like me what I don't understand In hindsight, this was like watching a soap opera between father and daughter.  For someone who cares about his daughter so much has no problem running over the crops she'll need to feed off tomorrow. Send the same guy into space with embryo's - he is going to raise them as his own right? Humans can't take care of themselves at infancy, we know that - so someone has to. Speaking of sending, how the hell does NASA build a rocket underground with no pilot planned to take the helm of saving the human species. The not so intelligent humans from the future (5th? dimension) kindly tore open a wormhole next to Saturn, wait what? Thats 2 years away!!  The wormhole scene - looked fantastic! Let get to the other side of space - Not a single reaction from any of our three astronauts who has just travelled the cosmos - not a single moment spent admiring a black hole, or looking around to see whats what around you. To planet H2O - loved the huge wave scene. Kill someone off who is stupid enough to let nature take his life over the sight of a wave. The bookshelf scene was plain stupid, I get it - he is in the 4th dimension so everything is always happening at the same time. pushing strings in an attempt to push a book of a shelf, wait isn't this in a parallel universe - so its another Murph? his own Murph has already passed that time - I am confused here.  Have you a seen a picture of a black hole made by Nasa which represents the data they've collected from their telescopes? There is a vortex above and below it - spewing out everything it chews up. Its common sense to say a black hole leads you nowhere apart from destruction.  I won't even go into the Matt damon Scene - could have easily shaved off 30mins of the already 'lost interest' in the movie. Eureka - Murph found out how to control gravity... Don't just say Eureka then forget about it! We're all dying to know, make some BS up at least to keep us entertained! BS sure but keep is logical skipping forward, 110 years later with planet Earth dying and with the lack of resources, they've still managed to leave earth and colonise a moon near Saturn. 50 years later and we haven't colonised crap on our own moon! Besides, I thought CooP used up the last rocket NASA had in his 'save the humans' mission? Daddy comes home since after all, Being with his daughter has been his whole goal through out the movie. Clearly he went on his own motives which happens to be more important than the most important thing in his life - yup, and her name is Murph. Then Murph says, great to see you - Bye!! Wait what? Let me ask, Is he dead after the black hole? so everything after is a hallucination?  sorry but a big disappointment for me... Even if just from an entertainment perspective, it was a huge bore. I'd rather watch Justice League, no wait.. err maybe I wouldUnmatched visuals and writing, yet sentimentalist and most definitely not Nolan's best directorial work I will keep this short for the sake of not spoiling anything. Right off i should say I love Nolan. I adore most of his movies, and Interstellar is no exception. It is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. His shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. Maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw, but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with 'Interstellar.' This could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the father-daughter relationship he creates. Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen.  Ultimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don't think this is Nolan's best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan's most ambitious and visually-striking work.  By the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to "2001: A Space Odyssey" is out of their mind. Kubrick's mission was to create art. Nolan in "Interstellar" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work.Why tack on an ending where everything works out perfectly?! The first 80-90% of "Interstellar" I absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. Sadly, the ending inexplicably had an ending that didn't make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice Hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. It's sad, but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am I to complain?! As for the film, there are a bazillion reviews so I will be brief. The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home, it would still lose something. Like the wonderful "Gravity", it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances. Overall, the good certainly outweighs the bad and it's a film to see. But as for me, an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay.Often impressive and very beautiful, but less than stellar As someone who likes the cast, loved the concept and who considers Christopher Nolan very talented and has enjoyed a good deal of his films, 'Interstellar' was somewhat of a let-down. It has a lot of great elements, but also has its flaws and one admires Nolan more for his ambition than his execution. Starting with the praises, 'Interstellar' does look spectacular. It's majestically shot, seamlessly edited and boasts audacious set design and fantastic special effects. The music score from Hans Zimmer is perhaps his best effort for a Nolan film, it has subtlety but also an unnerving eeriness and haunting and heart-wrenching pathos. The sound effects and sound mixing are expertly managed and give a real sense of authenticity. 'Interstellar' however has more than just being technically spectacular. It is thought-provoking and awe-inspiring frequently, with some fascinating ideas, and does have a lot of heart, making the emotional elements genuinely poignant. The Cooper/Murph relationship, which is really what takes centre stage, is beautifully done and often very heartfelt. Nolan directs with great ambition, strong direction of the actors and flawless technical command. Matthew McConaughey proves that his Best Actor Oscar for 'Dallas Buyers Club' wasn't a fluke, he holds everything together in a committed, charismatic and deeply felt turn. MacKenzie Foy matches him beautifully as does Jessica Chastain. Anne Hathaway is sassy and emotive, and there is fine support from John Lithgow and Michael Caine. However, 'Interstellar' is overlong and, because of the wildly variable pacing and that the story doesn't quite have enough content to justify it, it feels it. The pacing is wildly variable as aforementioned, there are times where it's fine but there's some choppiness and stodginess too. Dialogue isn't a strong suit either, there are many times where it's thought-provoking and poignant, but too much of it also consists of confused and at times illogical science (the time and space stuff was convoluted sometimes), forced sentiment and things being over-explained and preachy. Matt Damon's character felt thrown in and not particularly necessary, also somewhat silly, while the ending is far too idealistic and too falsely pat. Overall, less than stellar and was expecting much better. This said, 'Interstellar' is often impressive and very beautiful (especially technically, though the central relationship was also beautifully realised). 6/10 Bethany CoxAnother bloated, overrated space epic Another outer space film from Hollywood, this time directed by INCEPTION's Christopher Nolan. Thankfully it's better than the overrated GRAVITY, but INTERSTELLAR soon turns out to be overrated in turn. It seems that as soon as a film comes out these days with a half intelligent premise, critics and audiences lap it up and rate it as one of the best ever. INTERSTELLAR is far from that. It has plenty of interesting moments, but the overlong running time is padded and bloated with endless sentimentalism and extraneous characters. It also takes a heck of a lot of time for anything to actually happen. Matthew McConaughey is all earnestness as the protagonist and comes across as a dullard; Anne Hathaway's character is completely extraneous and lacking in charisma. Only old timers like John Lithgow and Michael Caine shine, although Wes Bentley is underutilised in his role. An unexpected appearance from Matt Damon is undoubtedly the story's highlight. For much of the running time this follows the template of a typical space adventure, but around the middle part of the film it starts to get weighed down with endless CGI effects and the whole end part of the production gets muddled and predictable in equal measure, coming across like a rip off of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY but not nearly as good.some problems but a few great touches of 2001 In the near future, Earth is devastated by blight where corn is the only surviving crop. Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former astronaut pilot who has turned to farming like everybody else. He and his daughter Murph find an underground NASA site run by Dr. John Brand (Michael Caine). Brand calculates that the blight will wipe out mankind in a generation. He is working on plans to save humanity after wormholes have been discovered leading to other worlds. Coop goes on a mission with Brand's daughter Dr. Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romilly and Doyle. However the mission runs into problems of relativity and sabotage. Meanwhile Murph (Jessica Chastain) grows up and tries to finish the calculations by Brand. I have problems with the setup to this movie. The idea that everybody needs to turn into farmers seems laughable. There are all kinds of problems with the start. The blight seems to be a catch-all for Nolan to use as a tool to explain away whatever he needs. It's inelegant and clunky. Apparently, science is not necessary anymore in this world. It's not like this dystopian world has run out of oil. A lot of it seems unlikely. Once McConaughey goes up into space, the movie gets better. It has touches of 2001 but generally, it is more like 2010. There are still some problems with unlikely human reactions. The whole conflict between Tom and Murph seems overblown. It's trying to up the drama without setting it up properly. I like McConaughey's side of the story. I would have preferred to stay mostly with him and lose some of Chastain's. I'm afraid the time relativity ideas may be lost on some of the audience. Even the best parts of the movie do have some nagging questions. It is still an awesome movie despite its problems. Although, I thought he might turn into a space baby at the end.It doesn't all work, but it is beautiful in its efforts I'd heard fairly mixed things about this film, and often heard praise for elements that I think one shouldn't lead with, so I did put off seeing it until very recently. The reason for this mixed reaction I guess if that it is a very mixed bag of a film, and I can see why people love it, hate it, and a bit of both. The plot sees a series of unexplained events bringing a farmer and former pilot into a group looking to save humanity from the earth, which is currently killing itself and threatening to take mankind with it. Looking to the stars, in particular a black hole which seems to have been placed nearby to allow for travel to much more distant worlds, he learns of previous missions to scout out other planets on the other side, and that he is needed to lead a mission to follow up the promising leads, leaving his family behind potentially forever. To get it out of the way, there is a lot not to like about the film. It runs very long, and at some points this almost seems deliberate ‚Äì like it has to be a certain length to be able to be called an epic. It also has variable pacing and plotting across this time, with some elements not making logical sense without even having to nitpick on technical details. However, while it doesn't all come together, the film is no less beautiful for what it does while it is trying to do it all. The visual effects are stunning, with believable space travel and worlds created, to the point that although a lot of it is technobabble, you do tend to go along with it and accept everything being laid out. Just as important as the technical, visionary stuff, is that the film has a very human heart throughout. It is surprisingly emotional, even when in the context of pure sci-fi elements; you do tend to buy characters as people, with their flaws, their pain, their motivations ‚Äì it is surprising how strong the film is in this regard. Part of this working is that the performances are universally strong, although to just pick one ‚Äì Mathew McConaughey is really great throughout. His down-to-earth elements bring the viewer into the film, while he completely nails the emotional content, which again helps convince us of the reality of the situation and passage of time ‚Äì because we see how it hits his character, so it must be real. The director marshals all this in a feast for the eyes, heart, and brain ‚Äì it doesn't all work, like I say, and it is far from being the perfect, flawless film that some would suggest, but it is engaging, thoughtful, heartfelt, and very well made.Maybe the most spectacular movie of 2014 and one of the best Christopher Nolan's "Batman"-trilogy, so here is his newest work: "Interstellar". He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuar√≥n with Gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on Planet Earth. However, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate. This is like our generation's "Armageddon", only that it is much better and much more edge-of-the-seat. The lead character is played by Matthew McConaughey, whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an Academy Award win. "Interstellar" is much more than Sci-Fi though. I personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. The water planet sequence was incredibly well done. And right afterward, when Cooper (McConaughey) sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents, it is truly moving as well. I had a lump in my throat just like I did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. The inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first, but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really. Then, I also had a love-hate relationship with the Matt Damon parts. I found it pretty boring to be honest initially, but when we found out about his true intentions, it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. Nicely done. When Caine's character mentioned him with high praise early on, I felt there could be something fishy there and yes it was. The ending of the movie with Hathaway's character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. Saving Private... ehh I mean Dr. Brand. Who knows? The time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. Somehow, the NASA lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in American school books. It is some point in the future. that much we know. David Oyelowo, plays a small role here, as one of the teachers. He has "Selma" in the race for an Academy award nomination this year. The ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion, but I still liked it. The whole ghost explanation about Cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. The effects are brilliant of course as that does not really be mentioned for Nolan movies. Hans Zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from McConaughey's charm (if you like that) and some droll robot creatures. Anyway, I found the film interesting enough that I found it a bit say they did not get to visit the third planet (with Hathaway's character's lover), only the water planet and the ice planet. I'd have loved to see that. However, maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. The movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the three-hour mark. It could have run for another hour and I probably would not have been bored. There really was hardly anything wrong with it. Affleck's character did not do too much for me. He wasn't particularly well-acted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to Chastain's character: the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to Cooper. John Lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always. This is one of the movies I really recommend to watch it, preferably on the big screen due to it's sensational visual aspects. It's also good for a rewatch I believe, also to evaluate the characters' actions, especially Caine's for example. And the story of course. I believe, after one viewing, I am still far away from having understood everything that was going on, especially the scientific aspects. That however, does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the film's great acting and emotional impact. If you are interested in space, you really have to see this too. It has distant planets, wormholes, black holes, spaceships and a lot more. Let me finish this review with two little snippets: First, the actress who played Murph as a child was the same that played Renesmee in the last two Twilight movies and, secondly, that fittingly Hathaway's character fittingly was called Amelia like the aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. That can't be coincidence, can it? Especially with her last shot.Pretentious and Overrated Trip In a post-apocalyptic future, crop blight is destroying civilization. The former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) lives in a farm in the countryside with his teenage son Tom, his daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Murph is convinced that there is a ghost in her room trying to communicate with her and Cooper decodes a message with a coordinate. He heads to the location and finds a hidden NASA facility. Cooper meets Professor Brand (Michael Caine) that explains that they have found a wormhole and sent several spacecraft to seek a planet to send mankind. Only three of them are returning signals and now they want to launch the spacecraft Endurance to recover the collected data. He invites Cooper to be the pilot of Endurance and travel with his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway); the scientists Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi); and the robots TARS and CASE. Cooper accepts and Murph is overwhelmed with his decision. Copper crosses the wormhole to a distant galaxy in the beginning of a dangerous trip to save mankind.  "Interstellar" is a sci-fi with a pretentious and overrated trip by the Hollywood darling Christopher Nolan. The story has a promising beginning, but becomes totally nonsense in the moment that Cooper leaves Brand. The plot is pretentious and uses Einstein relativity theory and other scientific concepts that are impossible to know whether they have scientific accuracy or not. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Interestelar" ("Interstellar")Absolutely Brilliant A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival. Going into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors. This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a "Hathaway hater" like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in "Wild". This may be the greatest ever film about physics.Intellectual, Although Sometimes Flawed Science Fiction I'm treading on some little used ground. From reading previous user comments, it seems that people give this movie a ten or a one (really?!). While this movie is, at times, a little confusing in the implications of time and space, it is still quite challenging and interesting. Earth is dying. Technology and war are blamed for the current conditions. Apparently, because of some serious dust, crops are slowly being destroyed. Also, the dust presents health hazards. The solution is to find a way to get people to a new place...or...to let the chips fall and send a few into space to inhabit a new planet or asteroid or moon or whatever, and start the whole thing over. A group of people who have maintained NASA (which is now seen as the deceivers of mankind) are building ships to explore the possibilities. The problem has to do with a limited time to manage this because of the laws of relativity. I thought it sort of devolved in a kind of sentimental mess, but the presentation of the problem is worth a viewing. There is some preachiness here which I find a bit hard to take, and a couple stated lessons that an eighth grader would know, let alone these experts. But it did keep my interest. One short criticism: It is way too long.Interstellar I saw the poster for this film long before its release, and it was billed to be a big blockbuster, the success of space movie Gravity probably helped the hype, directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception). Basically in the near future Earth is facing the extinction of the human race due to drought, famine and extreme climate change. Widowed former science engineer and NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) runs a farm with his father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow) and lives with teenage son Tom (Timoth√©e Chalamet) and ten year old daughter Murphy "Murph" (The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn's Mackenzie Foy), she believes her room is haunted, the "ghost" she and Cooper discover is communicating through gravitational waves, leaving binary coordinates in dust. These coordinates direct Cooper to a secret NASA installation led by Professor John Brand (Sir Michael Caine), there may be hope for the human race to survive; a wormhole, created by alien intelligence, discovered in the further reaches of the solar system, leading to another galaxy, surrounding the black hole Gargantua three potentially habitable worlds have been identified, named Miller, Edmunds, and Mann, after scientists who surveyed them. Cooper is recruited to pilot the spacecraft Endurance to explore these planets, if one of them can sustain life then humanity will follow in space stations, but this means he will be away from home for many years, but this mission is important, Murph is devastated by his departure, they part on bad terms. On Endurance, Cooper is joined by Brand's biologist daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway), scientists Romilly (Cloud Atlas's David Gyasi) and Doyle (American Beauty's Wes Bentley), and robots TARS (voiced by The Grinch's Bill Irwin) and CASE (voiced by Josh Stewart), the scientists go into hibernation while the craft travels towards the black hole, once close they awake and try to withstand the turbulent effects. The first head to planet Miller, but it being so close to Gargantua means it experiences severe gravitational time dilation: every hour on the surface is seven years on Earth, it is inhospitable, being covered by shallow ocean that experiences enormous tidal waves, Amelia tries to recover data, but Doyle is killed and departure is delayed, returning to the shuttle Cooper and Amelia find 23 years has passed. Back on Earth, adult Murph (Zero Dark Thirty's Jessica Chastain) is now a NASA scientist assisting Brand with his equation to enable NASA to launch the massive space station, near death Brand admits he already solved the problem and determined it is an impossible project, he covered this up and put faith in "Plan B": using fertilised embryos to start humanity anew, however Murph says the equation could work with additional data from a black hole's singularity. The Endurance only has enough fuel to visit one more planet, after a tense vote they decide Mann is best, however landing they find it is icy and inhospitable, they do however find Dr. Mann (Matt Damon) in hibernation, awoken he tells everything he knows about the mission, he knew "Plan B" was the true goal, he faked data to be rescued. In a moment of madness Mann breaks Cooper's spacesuit visor and leaves him to die, fleeing to Endurance on a shuttle, Romilly is killed by a bomb Mann planted, Amelia rescues Cooper and they get to Endurance, just as Mann docks improperly and causes the airlock to explode, serious damage is caused, but Cooper gets Endurance under control using the shuttle. Nearly out of fuel Cooper and Amelia plan to slingshot Endurance around Gargantua towards Edmunds, Cooper sacrifices himself with TARS to collect data on the singularity, detaching into the black hole and propelling Amelia by dropping the ship's mass, Cooper and TARS enter an extra-dimensional "tesseract", where time appears as a spatial dimension and portals show glimpses of Murph's childhood bedroom at various times. Cooper realises the alien beings may be human from the future who have constructed this space for him to communicate with Murph and save humanity, the coordinates from previously were in fact Cooper himself, finding adult Murph in the "tesseract" he uses gravitational waves to encode TARS's data on the singularity into Murph's watch, with this she solves Brand's equation and the process of evacuating Earth begins, the "tesseract" is closed and Cooper ejected from Gargantua back into the Solar System near Saturn. Time dilation from the entire mission means that humans have evolved to become an advanced space faring race, Cooper is found by a space police vehicle before his oxygen level drops, he wakes on-board "Cooper's Station", he explores the alternative world, and he reunites with elderly Murph (The Exorcist's Ellen Burstyn) who led the exodus of humanity, she advises Cooper and TARS to search for Amelia, who has begun preparation on the planet Edmunds. Also starring Casey Affleck as adult Tom Cooper, Spider-Man 3's Topher Grace as Getty, The Last King of Scotland's David Oyelowo as School Principal and William Devane as Williams. McConaughey holds it together well as the forthright pilot into space, Hathaway is good being informative, Chastain does well as the angry but important daughter, Damon is a welcome surprise, and Caine gets his moments as the wild old man. The majority of the film has similar scale and vision to 2001: A Space Odyssey, utilising fantastic special effects for spectacular visuals and extra-terrestrial worlds, I can see elements of Silent Running as well, it does get soppy towards the end with a concept like Contact (coincidentally also starring McConaughey), but overall it is a majestic space film with plenty to offer, including heart, a worthwhile science-fiction adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Music for Hans Zimmer, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Original Music and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Very good!A journey across the galaxy to save humanity Set in a future where crop species are going extinct one after another former test pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer growing corn. His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing back on Earth. This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension, including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey, who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway, who plays Amelia Brand a scientist aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain, who play the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great, as one would expect in a film from Christopher Nolan, and I was pleased that space was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration. Overall I'd recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of '2001 ‚Äì A Space Odyssey'¬Ö although this has more emotion to it than that classic."We're not meant to save the world, we're meant to leave it." Uh-oh, here I go again. The movie's out, what, a week or so as I write this, and IMDb voters have it ranked the 11th best movie of all time!!?? If there's justice in a rational world this would never happen. But it's not a rational world anymore now, is it, when an MIT professor can be found on tape explaining how the President's signature health care law was built on lies and deceit, and the media isn't even interested in covering the story. I could rant on but what's the point. I guess if you're name is Nolan, any movie that comes out with the director's fingerprints on it will be hailed as monumental. I don't have a beef with Nolan personally, I think he makes some visually fantastic films (this is one to be sure), but most of the time I think the hype precedes the product and then everyone else falls in line singing the praises. Case in point - "Interstellar". Nominally a sci-fi thriller, the picture devolves into something of a time travel anomaly that leaves the viewer scratching their head when hero Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) finds himself on the wrong side of the bookshelves in one of the picture's pivotal moments. I'm sitting there thinking 'this is what I came to see the movie for'? I'm not even going to start on Coop's selection to save the planet just by showing up at Professor Brand's (Michael Caine) facility. Which by the way, didn't it start out as some shack in the desert? When we get a tour of the place, it's got NASA central looking like a global conglomerate. Speaking of which, how is it NASA's still around for this massive undertaking to repatriate all of Earth's citizens to another planet? Unless I'm mistaken, NASA's primary goal now is Muslim outreach and all the best and brightest brains have farmed out. My head is starting to hurt. It was a small theater crowd last night, and I usually don't do this, but since a gentleman ahead of me held the door as I filed out, I asked him what he thought of the movie. His exact words were "That was a piece of excrement", only he used the more colloquially popular term for excrement. I wouldn't go that far, but if one hour in the wormhole equals seven years of Earth time, you're going to get old real fast trying to understand this picture.Out of this world A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time. Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...This is my kind of movie, Sci-Fi with a good story and lots of action. I am a Scientist, and I have always been fascinated with travel into space, ever since I looked up in the 1950s with my dad and spotted the Russian Sputnik satellite overhead in the night sky. This movie, "Interstellar", is my kind of movie. I saw it at home on Blu-Ray. As one would expect for this type of movie the picture and sound are both superb, and many times the deep, rumbling bass rattled the fireplace grill and the framed posters on my wall. It is long, at 2 hours and 45 minutes to the closing credits, but every minute was attention-grabbing. I will watch it again. The setting is the future, not too distant, and Matthew McConaughey is former Astronaut Cooper, now a corn farmer. Where he lives are recurring giant dust storms, a barometer of how close the planet Earth is to no longer being able to support human life. Everyone is worried but also busy surviving. Cooper also has a bright 10-yr-old daughter and together they make sense of some strange happenings in her bedroom, books falling off the shelves, dust making patterns, they figure out some coordinates that take them to the top secret location of the remaining NASA headquarters. In secret they have been developing a space ship capable of going to the outer reaches of the Solar system to encounter a wormhole, they think put there by intelligent beings, to allow passage into a distant system that may have planets that can support human life. Cooper is needed as pilot for the mission, not knowing if he will ever return to his family. One of the scientists making the trip is Anne Hathaway as Brand, daughter of the old scientist leading the project. Plus several others. There is an intelligent robot with Bill Irwin as the voice of TARS. (As an aside, Irwin had a recurring role on the old TV series 'Northern Exposure' and his presence here brought back fond memories.) So the whole story gets pretty complicated and cannot always follow good science. Still it is extremely well presented, with a totally novel ending. Writer/director Nolan borrows from his "Inception" bag of tricks, when every hour on a planet near a black hole is like 7 years back home, so everyone on Earth ages far ahead of the crew. Really, really good movie. SPOILERS: (For my own recollection.) In the end Cooper and his ship are being sucked into a black hole, the ship is being ripped apart, he ejects and, instead of being consumed he ends up in a type of matrix behind the walls and bookshelves of his daughter's room, he can see her, he realizes it was actually him who those years earlier had given her the signals. Forward to a few years later, he is on an orbiting sanctuary, while he contemplates joining Brand now on a new planet trying to colonize it.Interstellar is quite an intriguing space movie requiring some attention to the narrative Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think.Disappears up its own black hole. As directed by Christopher Nolan, he of the pretentious, derivative, mind-bending crap-fest that was Inception and the vastly over-rated Dark Knight trilogy, I fully expected Interstellar to have plot holes you could pilot a space station through‚Äîand, with a whopping running time of 169 minutes, I figured staying awake would be a task almost as gargantuan as the film's black hole (which is actually called Gargantua‚Äîthat's just how gargantuan it is!!!). Sure enough, the preposterous pseudo-scientific plot can be picked apart with ease, but the film itself is something of an anomaly: although it is a grossly indulgent pile of pretentious hooey that stretches plausibility to breaking point, I found myself entertained throughout. Interstellar is so far up itself that it actually transcends all the laws of cinema and proves to be a rather enjoyable piece of big-budget baloney as a result. For starters, we get Matthew McConaughey's farmer Cooper, who is chosen to pilot NASA's only spacecraft, despite having spent the last decade or so growing corn. Then we get two of science-fiction's most aesthetically awkward robots in the form of A.I. units TARS and CASE. After flying through a worm-hole, Cooper lands his spacecraft in several inches of water and then surfs a massive tidal wave. We see a planet so cold that its clouds are solid ice. We have a mad scientist who rants about the human instinct for survival while head butting Cooper with his space helmet. Although Michael Caine's character spans 23 years, he doesn't look a day older than when we first see him (his voice just gets a bit hoarse, but not Batman hoarse). And Cooper enters a black hole where he ends up behind a 5-dimensional bookcase that allows him to manipulate gravity to send a message to his daughter via wristwatch!!! And that's just the stuff I can recall right now (it's waaay past my bed-time and I'm very tired). If only there had been a few ninjas, some gratuitous female nudity (perhaps a race of insatiable, sexy alien maidens with over-sized breasts), a planet of space zombies, and a laser battle, this would have been the perfect so-bad-it's-good movie. 7/10: it's too wonderfully silly for me too hate on it as much as I really should.Dissymmetries, sight The good news that we have the brothers reunited and again working on circular narrative. Again, we have a powerful narrative arc that shifts in unexpected and engages in expected ways. The device is hackneyed: messages from the future, but is handled deftly. Where it is clumsy, we are competently distracted by narrative and visual process. The love story that drives this is novel enough to not fall into one of the three formulas commonly used for 'love,' (despite McConaughey) or two for father-rescues-daughter. We have a chosen child who saves the world by supernatural intervention, but again, this doesn't distract. These accomplishments alone make this worth experiencing because many devices are used to reset our expectations from formulas. Some fail horribly and that keeps this film from my absolute essential viewing list; I'll get to those in a moment. But all that are under the control of the filmmaker are so well considered that they bear mention. Take, for example the visual setting. The story itself is about the folding of time, but in a subtle way. The time of the story is in the future, but the setting is in the past. We refer to the dustbowl. All the cars, buildings, clothes and verbal expressions are vaguely from that era. We never see a brand that would pin down the time. More powerfully, the film itself is made as a science fiction film would be in the 50s-60s, using notions and tropes from that era. The robot is from "Forbidden Planet." The notion that a world-saving enterprise rests on the mathematical attempts of one man alone. That a vast enterprise is actually secret and located in one spot, with no suppliers. That construction of a spaceship requires welding sparks. That a heavy lift launch can occur in a building. Look at the computer screens. Nearly all are commandline interfaces. The switches and control panels are from the DEW line era. They haven't managed to use legacy fonts in the signage, but it looks like they avoided the most obvious: helvetica. Even the drone is a currently obsolete model. Underscoring all this is setting the film in Texas. Malick, and before him Bogdanovich, Hooper, Welles exploited the fact that Texas lives in two eras, sucking riches from the present while defining itself in some fictitious and better past. The film is also clearly in a future, after antiscience politicians have written technology out of the textbooks, denying the moon landing and forcing something named NASA underground. The ambiguity of time is conveyed subconsciously and works. I think they used some recorded interviews from the actual dustbowl era. But the flaw, the underlying decay in this film is in who they relied on for the science. They clearly separated the science of the adopted genre (noted above) from the science used in the actual extraterrestrial events. They chose renown physicist Kip Thorne as their authority. The man is an important scientist and reportedly very engaging. But the world of such scientists is divided between those who believe in the primary eminence of geometry and those who believe instead in ordered mechanics. This is a deep divide, highly polarized when the work gets going.  Which is better for the problems at hand is irrelevant here. But which is better for cinematic depictions of encounters with the forces of the world¬Ö well there is no contest and Noland chose unwisely. I may write about this. A good title may be the Carl Sagan effect. On other unrelated matters, some unresolved minor plot threads remain. The finished film exceeded the time budget for story-before-launch as it is, but we'd like to know what the reason for introducing the drone was and why it was important. A bit worse: In the film, we have a very hard won ability to send messages back in time, describing deep science from inside a black hole. I get that. But 'before' all those events, some other souls sent back messages and the physical artifact of the wormhole. Why not use that mechanism, unless the much-mentioned notion of the urges of love are essential to the bridge?Absolutely thrilling! A can't miss movie! Christopher Nolan directs an enthralling space odyssey, co-written with his brother Jonathan. This movie lives up to the hype and is one not to be missed. The earth is chocking as it is a starving Dirt Bowl. The future is dim as farmers are producing less and less to feed the population. Cooper(Matthew McConaughey)is a former test pilot and widower raising two children, fifteen year old Tom(Timothee Chalamet) and ten year old Murph(Mackenzie Foy), who is suspended from school for fighting. She refuses to believe the school books being right, saying the Apollo missions were faked in order to bankrupt Russia's space program. Cooper and daughter stumble across the remnants of the believed to be defunct NASA, where Professor Brand(Michael Caine) convinces Cooper he is the only one to command a mission to be launched into space in search of a new planet that can sustain life. The flight must enter a wormhole that will warp time, but allow a crew to rescue data from explorers, who preceded them. A member of Cooper's mission is Brand's daughter(Anne Hathaway). Deep on the mind of Cooper's daughter is the fact that if and when her father makes it back to earth, he will be the same age or older than her due to the time warp. No little green men, no aliens in sight. There are a couple of highly intelligent computerized robots, so to speak. Visually awesome and enhanced by Hans Zimmer's score. McConaughey seems driven and invested. Young Miss Foy is very watchable. And Jessica Chastain is excellent in the role of the adult Murph. Also in the cast: John Lithgow, Wes Bently, Matt Damon, William Devane, Casey Affleck and Ellen Burstyn. Plus the voices of Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart. INTERSTELLAR is stellar!Worm-Holes ? What About Plot Holes ? One of my all time favourite novels is The Death Of Grass by the late John Christopher . Written in 1956 it tells off a virus that destroys the cereal crops of Asia , Africa and Europe plunging most of humanity in to famine . It was adapted by Cornel Wilde in a 1970 film called NO BLADE OF GRASS , a very bleak and hard hitting film but one that was also painfully disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying . That said the power of the premise is clear to see and one has high hopes it will be remade one day . Along comes Christopher Nolan a director so highly regarded that if he did a selfie on his I-phone then that clip would automatically find itself on the IMDb Top 250 film list and he takes the premise of The Death Of Grass as a plot device and manages to make a film far more unconvincing than Cornel Wilde's movie not t mention far more expensive  As I said humanity is being starved in to extinction and live on a diet of corn . Being set in the American mid-West corn is obviously easy to come by but would this be true of other people living on other continents ? I'm not a farmer or a geologist but surely there's a good reason why some countries have a staple diet of wheat while other countries have a staple diet of rice ? Perhaps the countries that no longer can grow wheat now grow root vegetables as their staple diet ?  I suppose you've got to join up the dots for yourself but it's rather annoying the way the rest of the world goes unmentioned almost as though the film makers have failed to think the scenario through properly . Especially later where mankind seems to be facing greater dangers from sand storms than famine  Some other things the makers haven't thought through with the film In this near future world armies no longer exist ? A noble ideal perhaps but surely if a nation state exists so would an army if only to protect itself from other nation states ?  It's official - everyone thinks the Moon landings were faked . I can see Nolan having a dig at creationism being taught in American schools but this ties in with another plot turn NASA still exists as a secretive organization ! Right so the government agency that sent men to the Moon and back exists as a real though somewhat underground organization and yet everyone thinks the Moon landings are faked ? Can't see the logic behind this . It also adds more confusion when ... NASA send the protagonists to a wormhole just off Jupiter . It's never revealed if these space journeys have US government approval but if not why would a government scrap standing armies and not totally shut down an agency that can send people to the ends of the solar system if you're going to teach conspiracy theories in school ? In reality it also be technically and monetary prohibitive for an agency to do this without government approval , Certainly internal logic and continuity is not the films strong point . It's also a film that's over long and contains an ending straight out of the more prentious episodes of SPACE 1999  This is a pity because it's more than competent on a technical level and I can see Nolan is trying to make an intelligent space epic that will try and grab the audiences attention and fire up their passion for real life science . Unfortunately he's left out the intelligence in crafting a drama and when this fails so does everything elseA Tale Of Love And Sacrifice Interstellar is a science fiction film that tells the story of space travelers that are in search of a new habitable planet in the outer space.The cast includes Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine. It was written by the Nolan brothers: Jonathan and Christopher,who also the director of the film. The time on Planet Earth is nearly up.Cooper,who happens to be a frustrated farmer as it has fallen victim into famine caused by overpopulation; a blight is killing crops and creating massive dust storms; and the rise of nitrogen that is going to cause asphyxiation that will cause the end of humanity.He also happens to be a former NASA Engineer and trained test pilot that lives with his children,Murp and Tom, together with his father-in-law,Donald.One night,Cooper and Murph reach into a secret underground location that was left by NASA wherein a project headed by Professor Brand that intends to find a habitable planet before the clock on earth runs out.Cooper is found to be qualified in this space exploration wherein the destination happens to be a wormhole near Saturn. He later learns that the wormhole happens to be inhabited by aliens of great intelligence that could help human beings survive the current situation and survive the conditions it is currently experiencing.Ten years back,astronauts were sent to scout a dozen possible habitable planets.But now,the human beings final destination is being determined.Mindful of his children's future,Cooper agrees to pilot the craft together with Brand's daughter, Amelia; scientists Doyle and Romilly and the sardonic robot TARS.Later,Murph grows up into adulthood forming anger towards her father.She becomes an astronaut and Brand's second-in-charge working for the same entity that took her father away from her.  The film depicts life on earth for the first 45 minutes.It establishes how humanity is suffering and the close father-and- daughter relationship between Cooper and Murph.The theme of sacrifice is fully explored especially after the father decided to leave his daughter for an space exploration for the sake of billions of people on the planet.It eventually disappoints Murph as she finds out that he may not be able to comeback.When the story shifts into space,the journey of the space exploration becomes the focus of the film.It was good to see Christopher Nolan limit the use of CGI effects so as not to overwhelm the viewer and let them go through the narrative which happens to be far from being clich√©d and predictable.The conclusion is where it takes its chances as it tries to resolve the conflicts of the story with some questions left unanswered.Despite being 3 hours long,it was far from being boring for it does not drag and the story is told in a breakneck pace. This is a big-budgeted science fiction movie that is worth more than $160 million that has a very simple tale of love and sacrifice which later becomes breathtaking,hopeful and heartbreaking.It is another visual masterpiece from Nolan especially with the great special effects that is far from overwhelming but truly amazing.The operatic music from Hans Zimmer is also worth mentioning.The complex dialogue about the outer space can also be easily understood by the viewer regardless of one's educational background.Finally,it's an amazing achievement that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible. Watching it at home, no matter how good the sound system is, won't match. This one should definitely be seen inside a movie house for it is an awesome and incomparable theater experience.Long, dull and WAY overpraised A simple farm guy named Copper (Matthew McConaughey) and a few other experts go into outer space to explore other worlds that might sustain human life. It seems that that life on Earth might not survive due to to some unexplained environmental disaster. Naturally nothing goes right. WAY overpraised and terrible sci-fi movie. When I heard the plot from this I expected the worst. Writer/director Christopher Nolan has never been a favorite for me--I HATE what he did to Batman in his movie trilogy. I thought that he as trying to imitate Stanley Kubrick ("2001") here but it's far worse--he's doing Steven Spielberg! The movie runs WAY too long (165 minutes) and they're constantly pushing family friendly values in your face. Cooper's non-stop yammering about his daughter got on my nerves instantly. Also that stupid fake southern accent he adopts is immediately annoying. The story is very slow and all the characters are cardboard cutouts you've seen in other movies. The special effects are flawless and there's some beautiful cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really weigh it down. Any sort of statement they're trying to make on time and life is completely deadened by the script. Also this movie is very manipulative and way too sentimental. They go out of their way to make the audience cry--like at a Spielberg movie. Well I did cry--tears of joy at the end that this was over! Also the gaps in logic and plot holes here are very annoying. I lost track of how many times I rolled my eyes at the dubious "logic" served up here. The acting was as good as it could be (I guess) but, at the end, they throw in a surprise guest star (who I won't name). It didn't help because I think he's a terrible actor and this didn't change my mind. I was bored and looked at my watch MANY times while this played. It's boring, obvious and manipulative. Why is this getting so much praise? Skip it.Gone To Earth I'm probably not the target audience for the freres Nolan as I tend to notice things instead of being seduced. Take the opening. We're in East Jesus in the heart of the dust bowl. An ordinary family, a wooden home one step up from a tarpaper shack. Inside an equally ordinary kitchen THEN, in the bedroom of the daughter of the house, Murph, we find FLOOR-TO-CEILING BOOKSHELVES? Fully stocked. You're putting me on, right, Chris. More? Seems the father of Murph is an ex pilot who has retired to become a farmer. No real problem there BUT, he and Murph stumble on some co-ordinates and follow them to a top-secret NASA base where the head honcho is Professor Michael Caine. They show the intruder the latest space-ship, explain that earth is running out of food and the only solution is to find a planet that will sustain human life AND THEN invite him to lead the mission. This is a guy who hasn't flown in x amount of years and may or may not be in shape. There is no training programme, no vetting, the whole thing resembles a car salesman offering someone who walks in off the street a chance to test drive the latest top-of-the-range Lamborghini. If you can get past this nonsense you may well enjoy what follows. Unlike, say, Gravity, which was virtually one hundred per cent in space, Intersteller does introduce a human element and is all the better for it. Clearly the Nolans are interested in exploiting technology at the expense of constructing an even halfway plausible screenplay and there are probably enough overgrown schoolboys out there who will respond to cgi the way Pavlov's dog responded to a bell.Emotionally captivating and intellectually challenging This film tells the story of an ex-pilot in a world full of dust storms. He is chosen to travel to the uncharted parts of the space in search for a new habitable planet. "Interstellar" is a long film, and the first two hours of it does not seem like a typical Christopher Nolan film. Most of the scenes are (literally) down to Earth, with no fancy visual effects. It spends much time building up the story, telling the story of a father and his daughter who sees 'ghost' in her bedroom. Through this ghost, one thing led to another, and the man is in space. When the film is not down on Earth, it looks more like a disaster film. The first adventure is a spectacular feat involving water. It also introduces the physics of relativity, on how time slows down in another world, leading to a misguided decision of the astronauts in retrospect. This sets the foundation for future plot involving more relativity. As the film progresses, there is more adventure, both in the form of adrenaline pumping adventure and humanity and integrity testing conditions. Matt Damon's character forms a central subplot that makes me reflect on what lengths would people go in order to achieve a certain goal. It reflects on the reality that people are driven by egocentric instincts. It is not a pretty truth, but it tells that human are not idealistic creatures. The final half an hour is what a typical Christopher Nolan film is like. It makes me hold my breath because it is so intense, both emotionally and cognitively. The ending gives me inexplicable exhilaration. Things come to a full circle, and it is filled with joy. It is not a film for everyone, as the story is long and takes a lot of time to build. Two people walked out of the cinema an hour into the film, and someone sitting behind me remarked after the film ended that he opined it was the most boring Christopher Nolan film ever. For me, I enjoyed "Interstellar" thoroughly, because it is emotionally captivating and intellectually challenging.Sometimes Dull and Overwritten but Worth a "Watch" In this Film Director Christopher Nolan can't Decide if He wants to be Steven Spielberg or Stanley Kubrick. He doesn't have the Talent of either but is a Good Filmmaker at times. He was 2 for 3 with the "Batman Trilogy", "Memento" (2000) was Unique, and has done some other Fine Films. Here, Not so Much. The Overt and Heavy Handed Sentimentality was better Restrained in "Contact" (1997). The unnecessarily Complicated and Thick Script reminds of "Inception" (2010). It tends to Confuse more than impress. It seems, when Matthew Mcconaughey asked the Director for Motivation He was told to Whisper and Mumble. The other Stars that Show up are OK if Nothing Special, although when Matt Damon wakes it Provides the Film with one of the better Pieces of Space-Drama. There are a few Good Lines..."Humanity was born on Earth but not meant to stay here." and "We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about are place in the dirt."  But the Overwritten Science-Babble and Over-Complicated Plot seems to try and Impress those Viewers that Think that "The 5th Dimension" is a Singing Group. A few Interesting and Artistic Scenes that are Outstanding, like the "Library" are what makes the Film rise Above Mediocre. But there's a lot of Technological Stuff considering the Time Frame and Events that really are Strange and Bewildering.  The Social behavior that got Humans to turn the Planet into a Dust-Bowl isn't Even Mentioned. Gravity, not the Movie, the other thing, is Mentioned Frequently. It's Worth a Watch but is mostly Disappointing and highly Derivative in both Style and Concept.  Science-Fiction, Contrary to most Haters of this thing, does not have to Obey Current Knowledge. It can, and often does, come from Made Up Stuff from Creative Minds. Directors and Writers are Free to Explore anything They can Imagine. That's why it is called Science "Fiction". So No Problem there.A Sci-Fi Masterpiece Hollywood science fiction spectacles about antagonistic aliens abandoning dying worlds to occupy not only Earth, but also to oust us have been popular with moviegoers. Typically, like the European explorers who invaded and disenfranchised millions in the Western Hemisphere during the 15th century, these extraterrestrials‚Äîeither bug-eyed behemoths with lobster claws or pod people whose seeds have drifted across the cosmos‚Äîshow up to evict or absorb us. "Inception" director Christopher Nolan's latest extravaganza "Interstellar," toplining Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow, is a superior space opera that reverses the action. Earthlings must abandon mother Earth because an environmental blight has devastated farming and millions have starved to death in overpopulated continents. No, "Interstellar" doesn't pit Earth against multi-colored "Guardians of the Galaxy" aliens or immaculate looking storm troopers in white outfits from the "Star Wars" and "Hunger Games" franchises. Instead, the "Interstellar" scientist heroes must search for a new home for humankind. Rather than an outlandish adventure epic with evil extraterrestrials, "Interstellar" qualifies as an intelligent, realistic, sometimes provocative, sci-fi saga similar to Stanley Kubrick's landmark movie "2001: A Space Odyssey." Mind you, Nolan doesn't chronicle mankind's evolution from the dawn of time the way Kubrick did in as "2001." The casts of "Interstellar" and "2001: A Space Odyssey" differ, too. Kubrick relied on an unknown cast, while "Interstellar" boasts a charismatic array of superstars. If you haven't seen "2001: A Space Odyssey," you won't appreciate some of the clever allusions to the legendary 1968 film. Anybody who has seen "2001" will be amused by a joke that a robot makes about blowing an astronaut out of an airlock. Ultimately, the most obvious "2001" references in "Interstellar" are those bizarre, oblong, Minecraft-style robots that resemble the black monoliths in Kubrick's film. Some of the sci-fi terminology may fly over your head, but Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan concern themselves with more than speculative science fiction ideas. They focus on relevant contemporary themes, such as father &amp; daughter relationships and the environment. They forge interesting characters with philosophical dialogue that you will ponder long after the movie.  "Interstellar" occurs in the late 21st century, after things have waxed really wretched. Bad enough that farmers can grow only corn. Blight has destroyed wheat and okra. Public opinion about NASA has curdled. History textbooks have been rewritten. Everybody believes NASA faked the Apollo moon landings to bankrupt the Soviet Union. A former NASA test pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey of "Mud"), has turned to farming and reaped rewards where many others have failed. Although his wife died from a brain cyst that an MRI could have detected had an MRI had been available, Cooper perseveres as a farmer and a father of two children, his fifteen-year old son Tom (Timoth√©e Chalamet of "Worse Friends"), and his precious ten-year old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy of "The Conjuring") who adore him. Cooper and his kids live with his father-in-law, Donald (John Lithgow of "Terms of Endearment"), and they contend with tumultuous dust storms on a daily basis. These dust storms recall the Depression Era drought and dust storms of that prompted millions to flee from the plains states. Dust gets into everything, and Donald wages a never-ending war to keep everything clean. Meanwhile, books have been toppling randomly from Murph's bedroom bookcase. She suspects a ghost is responsible, but nothing ghoulish like "Paranormal Activity." Naturally, Cooper dismisses the presence of ghosts. One day after a particularly turbulent dust storm, father and daughter examine the way the books have fallen out of the shelves, translate it into code, and come up with coordinates that lead them to a classified NORAD facility. A monolithic robot named Tars confronts them. Later, Murph and Cooper find themselves sitting around a table talking with high-ranking NASA officials. One of them is Professor Brand (Michael Caine of "Batman Begins"), and Brand confides in Cooper that the world is living on borrowed time. Moreover, he tells him about the 'Lazarus' project. NASA has dispatched manned missions to other parts of the galaxy to find a new home for mankind. He convinces Cooper to sign on as a pilot for one last launch that will take his daughter, biologist Amelia (Oscar winning actress Anne Hathaway of "Les Mis√©rables); physicist Romilly (David Gyasi); geographer Doyle (Wes Bentley of "The Hunger Games"); and two robots TARS (voice of Bill Irwin) and CASE (voice of Josh Stewart) deep into space to a recently discovered wormhole which will enable them to explore new worlds. Predictably, Murph isn't happy about her father's departure. During their flight to the wormhole, Cooper and company lose contact with Earth, but Professor Brand can still transmit messages. Gradually, however, things take a turn for the worst. The final quarter hour of "Interstellar" will absolutely boggle your mind. Cooper goes where no man has gone before in a desperate bid to save mankind!  "Interstellar" is a serious sci-fi movie. The computer-generated visual effects are nothing short of dazzling, and Nolan orchestrates the flight sequences so we don't hear any sounds in the vacuum of outer space. The different spacecraft and the Endurance mother ship look as authentic as the outfits that our heroes wear. The strange but new worlds that they encounter during their search to locate a new Earth are breathtaking. One world consists of an eternal sea with towering waves that loom like mountain ranges, while another is as stark and icy as it is inhospitable. The theme of deception runs throughout "Interstellar." The faked Apollo moon landing and Dr. Brand's mind-blowing revelation are a few surprises that will maintain your interest throughout "Interstellar." Nolan generates several suspenseful set-pieces that will keep you poised on the edge of your seat. Matt Damon has a startling cameo as another astronaut who has succumbed to effects of isolation. Clocking in at 169 minutes, "Interstellar" amounts to an unforgettable epic with intense white-knuckled suspense, top-notch performances, and a terrific ending.How disappointing I saw this movie recently while flying home from overseas. I was excited to see the movie listed on the in-flight entertainment system. I heard much about it, and my expectations were set high: after all, the movie's scientific accuracy was praised by Neil deGrasse Tyson, no less. The physics was supposed to be top notch, coming from none other than Kip Thorne himself. The same Kip Thorne who was co-author of Gravitation, the famous "MTW" (Misner, Thorne and Wheeler) textbook that occupies a premier spot on the bookshelf of any physicist who deals with gravitation. (Yes, it's also on my bookshelf. Yes, I can do the equations, too.) Don't get me wrong, I am no nitpicker like Sheldon Cooper. I know how to suspend my disbelief, and I don't let science stand in the way of a good story. Still, the science has to be at least marginally believable and the story has to be compelling. The science of Interstellar is completely bogus. Don't even get me started on the lack of stable orbits close enough to a black hole to produce the enormous time dilation. The energy requirements to get a spaceship away from such a deep gravitational well. The fact that on the surface of such a planet, all infalling light would be drastically blueshifted, arriving as deadly X-rays. The conflation of black holes and wormholes. The ridiculous time travel/five- dimensions/ghost story thing. It's. Just. Nonsense. As for the story... it was supposed to be compelling? Okay, it had a few decent moments, but even if I dismiss all the science issues, I still found the story neither credible or engaging. And to be honest, the visuals weren't that great either, be it the drug-induced hallucination supposedly representing five dimensions or the decidedly Kubrickian, 2001-style space travel sequence. Sure there are worse movies out there. But the only reason I don't call Interstellar a waste of three hours of my life is because that time was already wasted, sitting on an airplane. Still, in retrospect, I'd have been better off spending the time reading a good book. If only I had seen the movie's Honest Trailer on YouTube (which I just came across while I was writing this review) I'd surely have put those three hours to better use.Ouch! A painful journey through space, time and love. Let me start by saying, I'm certain I would more than struggle to make a better film. I am humbled by the energy, love and devotion required to produce the few moments that literally flash before our eyes. I also consider myself a huge fan of the Nolan brothers. Following, Memento, The Prestige, Inception, all films of exceptional quality and fantastic storytelling. For years, Christopher Nolan has worked literal movie magic, telling his audience exactly what to expect from the very beginning, yet delivering a performance that leaves them no less than astounded. Interstellar begins no different. Nolan practically hands the ending to the audience leaving little to surprise. But unlike previous masterpieces, Interstellar drags the audience on a painful, bumpy ride through space, time, love and death leaving some in hypnotic wonder. The rest, simply insulted, wishing for nothing more than to get back the past 169 minutes. "Stay," a message delivered by Cooper to his daughter across space and time, and yes, we knew it was him all along. "Stay," the message potential viewers should hear loud and clear. "Stay home." It's safe and warm. Revisit Memento, The Prestige or Inception and marvel at the layered depth of stories told so well you ache for them to be told again and again and again. Perhaps next time the Nolans will deliver on that hope. Until then, "Stay away" from Interstellar.Mediocre Interstellar is mediocre. The story is chock full of cheap clich√©s ("Love is the 5th dimension!"), over-layered with arcane science for believability and story points that are never explained. The movie makes sense until Matt Damon. Up to that point, the quantum mechanics and astrophysics hold up, more or less. Although¬Ö If you know you're going to age by 5 to 15 years on the water planet, why leave that one poor guy on his own? It's kind of heartless and that's when I started doubting the movie. But OK, fine. I can live with that. Then they head for the ice planet. And, all of a sudden, "gravity is the force that transcends time" and "your mind fights death so you can see your children". All downhill from there, way into deep space 9. The movie takes a turn for the worse: A nonsensical allegory about how humanity can be saved thanks to the power of love between a father and his daughter. It's endearing, but incomprehensible. Granted, the movie's pretty. So I gave it two stars. The actors? Love all of them. That's another 2. But I simply cannot live with a script that's nonsensical and full of stuff we're supposed to take at face-value, because it's Christopher Nolan, and he's an otherwise brilliant director: What was Michael Caine trying to not solve? What is all the research about? And, sci-fi directors: Please, drop the blackboard and chalk clich√©. We technology people use computers now. Blackboards were useful when Newton was running things. Now? Not so much. It sounded like (but I'm not really sure) the five dimension bookcase, which lost me completely, was invented by humanity in a very distant future as a communications device. But then I also have to assume that that future humanity has really awesome technology if it can pull that kind of prowess. Then, why not simply invent a cellphone that can bridge time? Why not just send an email with the data component that's missing? Why would anyone have to take a chance taking a dive into a black hole to get it? And how is that future humanity saved anyway? And: How does the robot, whose location in space is never explained, come in possession of that data? And do 21st century communications really work in a black hole? Going back to the Michael Caine thing: What's the precious data component that he was missing? What does the ghost send in binary format to his daughter? (sounds to me like a lot of zeros and ones). And how does humanity get saved? Do they invent some sort of galactic Noah's ark to get people off the smoking pile of carcinogenic garbage that Earth has become? Could they not do that before? I'm sure they could. How does a human being in a space suit even survive flying into a black hole? Or maybe that's not what happened. I'm just not sure.  The list goes on and on. the movie is a confusing hodge-podge of pseudo-philosophical-pseudo-scientific mess full of circular logic and loose ends. It's intended for (1) sci-fi dorks who tend to not over-think things (2) Nolan worshipers and lovers of all things shiny (3) movie "buffs" who enjoyed Cloud Atlas, which was more boring and more bizarre than Interstellar, but only slightly.Cool, but naive Not very realistic by many reasons.  First, there were absolutely no Russians and Chinese in space which is unprobably. There were some in Odyssey, in Armageddon, in Gravity and etc. Only Indian drone in the beginning and in space conspiracy flashbacks were involving other nations than Americans. Also I don't understand, why black hole and wormhole were different. Actually they are the same thing.  Also many pseudo-scientific phrases about dimensions and so on which don't mean anything. The giant waves were taken directly from the Abyss :) Otherwise the movie was cool :)One of the best! I already saw it twice, it was fantastic! Take my breath away! The actors made an excellent work, but the director show me that no only human being is the creator of science.. but it always been there. God is "they" and I had a wonderful time. I live in Chihuahua, M√©xico, and here in my country has already happen a lot of things that we can not be proud, but in the moment you enter in the movie theater you forget for almost three hours the outside, I love this kind OK movies, capture all your attention and moment. Many pictures of this please. Matthew McConaughey is really into he role, I do love his work and he became one of my favorites actors ever. Anne Hathaway, she was OK, not the best work of her, but it was great, I still love his short part in Brokeback Mountain, love it. She was incredible in One Day and I hope she accept that roles that she believe on.The most ambitious film to ever pull of what it attempted to achieve. I liked Interstellar. It wasn't the best movie I ever saw, perhaps not even one of the best... but it was very, very ambitious, and unlike most ambitious films, it delivered. His previous film outside the Batman franchise explained the process of inception in movie theaters in a very meta way. That movie took us deeper and deeper into the layer of dreams until we forgot that the outer layer was our own reality. Then it planted a seed, that once the target has been derived far enough from her own reality, an idea can be planted in such a way that the target does not reflect that it has been led or guided to the intended conclusion. The planted idea becomes the genuine idea of the target, and stays with the target once she has returned to her own layer of reality. This is performed by a crew of set builders, directors, actors and so in the perfect summary of what a good movie can do to the watcher. The film Inception is an inception of the idea of films as a tool for inceptions into the viewers of the film. And it does so in a very clever way. After pulling that of as a director/producer, what do you do next? You save the world. Some people have compared interstellar to Kubriks 2001: A Space OdysseyÔªø, and I will agree that on the surface, if you were to just look at the visuals from the films, there would be similarities. But when it comes to narration and theme, I would rather pair it with Cloud Atlas, the 2012 epic sci-fi by the Wachowski brothers. In what way? They are both inceptions. Cloud atlas is a story told in different times and places but it all comes down to different ways of getting the viewer to forget that she is watching a movie, and to immerse herself in the events that take place on the screen. And once that is achieved, the very simple message of every human beings equal value is told. That we shouldn't oppress each other. Stop being dicks. Interstellar does the same, but (almost) without the jumping back and forth in time. And once you are invested in the characters, once you have forgotten who you are, and immersed yourself in the world and the events that are being told on the screen, the message is clear: Start cooperating, and stop messing this world up, or we will all die. Stop being dicks. I've read reviews on Interstellar where they dislike it for the scientific errors (force feedback flight-sticks in space) or for the sometimes brute or overdone emotional scenes (filled with Zimmers bombastic horn blowing score) or the psychedelic kaleidoscope scenes at the end (an obvious 2001 homage, but IMHO, much better executed). But those things, while obviously there, are likely meant to be there. Meant to take your mind of other things. Because once you've vented your displeasure on facebook, maybe read a few reviews enforcing your suspicions about inaccurate science, and once you're back at your desk on the next work day... ...you realize that yes, NASA would have to be a secret organization in this world. Plan B might be the only option. Don't believe in ghosts. Some lies might have to be told to get us to cooperate, and others might ruin our chances as a species. And we really, really, have to stop being dicks, and learn to cooperate. Or our children might never have a future. And that is some ambition. And that, Nolan delivered. I recommend Interstellar.An exploration of mankind's inevitable future Faith and Love can transcend time and space, whether literally or scientifically. This is what Insterstellar goes out to prove. Faith in the people we love, in the promises they make, may not be a tangible thing, however that is what makes us who we are. Although the movie would be relished more by people having an interest in astrophysics, still others would love it as much. Mainly because of the way the movie is presented. The science and human emotions are so tightly intermingled, that you cannot distinguish one from another. The movie is not just about a scientific exploration but also exploring the human psyche. How our choices affect our loved ones? How true it is that the farther you go from your loved ones the closer you feel to them? In Interstellar Nolan tests the limits of human spirit, of human exploration, of human emotions and in this endeavor creates a masterpiece. The acting is brilliant, so is the screenplay and the casting. This one is a must watch. For me it is the best movie of this genre.  Cheers, SushantDon't get sucked into this movie black hole! Feeling very disappointed given all the hype and rave reviews. What a bunch of utter pseudo-scientific crap! The so-called "scientific advisors" must live in a parallel universe with completely different laws of nature. The characters are as flat as two-dimensional entities. The only realistic holes are not wormholes nor black holes but the gaping holes in the storyline. How come Hollywood these days always seems to take fascinating science fiction-themes and mangle them into some commercial junk that is all about fiction and has not the slightest thing to do with science? Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" is still light years ahead of the rest of the pack, almost 50 years since that brilliant film was created. Don't waste your money on this farce but buy a good book instead and create your own space-time adventure on your comfortable couch at home.wasting love It's a pretty good song performed by the king of heavy metal, Iron Maiden.  The song could be useful to describe the situation and the feelings of the people after watching the movie who like Sci-Fi as a root of all dreams. This is totally wasting of our great love of believing in Nolan's ability to let the audience to feel discovering something new. Combining Hollywood's clich√©s with our holy space-time love has just intrigued me. I've been totally disappointed yet hope that this would lead some brave and passionate directors to jump into space in their future movies.Disappointed.. The movie is fine. If you are an American. The only nation mentioned beyond the numerous US flags abroad was India.. People would think USA really believes they are the world and not actually using Russian rocket engines currently. Get real, I've got the message in the film, however, it was so lame to do it like that. We all know the West and US specially "buys" brains from abroad, and suck movies look just like a propaganda to pump up the somewhat deflated American ego as of late. There was some little to add, just to make the movie worth ten times more.The Science of Interstellar I read a book on the Science of Interstellar written by one of the producers, Kip Thorne who is an theoretical physicist, that says that everything written into the movie is possible according to our current understanding of science. That was the standard he and the other producer came up with at the inception of this film. Some things are not likely but they're still possible. Knowing this really made the movie surreal for me especially the gravitational lensing, time dilation and extra dimension elements of the film. The story itself is beautiful and hopeful but being backed by real science is what made this film exceptional. When it comes to the time travel related aspects you must understand that there is no time travel in this film. Time is not linear.Geniuses have done it again! Geniuses have done it again! Interstellar; meaning (Situated between stars) This is an Oscar nominee on so many levels my friends, Nolans and Zimmer Are mind-blowing combination of Art! what a marvelous, beautiful and emotional journey! and a trip we took around galaxies, around life! I knew this was going to be a masterpiece once I saw the name "Nolan" as a director! and his brother as a writer! and the name "Hans Zimmer" for music. They've never failed me, not even once! I don't know where to begin! This is a movie you have to shake your brain for. The Visuals were just beyond beautiful, to see earth and the galaxies, to lay sight on this marvelous creation of infinite countless space is just indescribable! These scenes aren't baked for Action Hollywood nonsense fans! This is highly sentimental, A scene you'd kill or die to see in real life is projected here right infant of your eyes! it screams: Serenity SERENITY! And hats off to Hans Zimmer, for the music that made all these sights and visuals extra beautiful, it just rips your brain senseless! its actually that great! its goddamn epic! Alfonso Cuar√≥n (Director of Gravity) thought that: Silence only, can describe this beauty! Human breath, and sound effects is what makes the scene massive, just silent space. Unlike Nolan here who believed in Music to show you inspiration and burst your emotions. I cannot even begin to talk about emotions that this film has. The relation between a father and a daughter! something that's so real, yet so painful! It's not so far from reality, and it has these subliminal inner meanings of life, that you have to go through in your head and see your life based on it! I shed tears on this. The plot was genius, something that "Nolan" has put hands on is always brilliant! It's complexity and simplicity combined, Beauty and logic, brain and heart, all Together! Excellent casting, Perfect Visuals and great sound score! along with humor of course, you'll have a short sweet laugh at some points. And once you get out of theater jaw opened, many questions will pop in your head about life, Earth and human race. What if this? and What if that? Is there really a way to explain the metaphysics scientifically? How about Fifth dimension, are we really going to reach that for once? ever? How can love be measured, how is related to humans and science. this is not a simple movie, I'll have to watch it over and over. This is a MUST-WATCH, you won't blink once, or be bored for a second! I don't even advise buying popcorn! something I regretted. Just clear off your head and go enjoy this masterpiece of Christopher Nolan!Worth a place in the firmament of the top fiction movies ever This is the story of Cooper and his daughter Murphy. Cooper is a space pilot, at a time when the world needs farmers more than pilots, as the Earth is dyeing and people starve. Cooper is a dreamer, dreaming of the times when "we used to look up wondering about our space in the stars as opposed to looking at our place in the dirt". Cooper thinks os being chosen by some mysterious entity to undertake a journey beyond human capabilities, a response to a call to save mankind. This journey will force him to abandon his family and especially his daughter Murph, and will take him along an incredible ride across space and time. The adventure is in itself epic, but what makes it even more engrossing is that the three main themes of the movie (the interstellar trip, the relationship between a father and his daughter and the underlying theme of time) are merged into a story with a wide breadth and with many human touches which make the story highly emotional. Nolan plays very creatively with the theme of time: he bends it, he makes it work like the famous Escher drawing (two hands drawing each other): Cooper is allowed to experience time as a physical dimension, where the past is a mountain to climb and the past is a canyon; but, unlike what he thought, he was not the one that was chosen, Murph was the one chosen to save mankind, and he was just the "bridge". All this makes of Interstellar much more than "just" a sci-fi movie, though it remains a great example of its genre. Clearly it taps into some some of the iconic all-time sci-fi movies, specifically 2001, but it deserves a space on its own in the firmament of the great fiction movies. Personally, this is one of the movies I have put right at the top, in the Olympus of my most loved movies ever.An emurphsive experience What do you get if you mix Van Hoytema, Nolan and Zimmer? Apart from one hell of a tongue twister, you get interstellar. But then add: the zest of an emotional, character-driven storyline; and the essence of big, existential questions posed via the contrasting, unfathomably complex, scientific theories, and you get the best film in a decade at least. Although it is something which I am loath to admit (especially after watching big, Hollywood movies) this film made me cry...several times. Sometimes a happy cry, sometimes a sad cry, other times a cry caused by the realisation of my own insignificance in the relatively vast expanse of time and space. But let there be no doubt about it, my face was more wet than a horny mermaid's lady pocket, by the end. That is what films are about, making you feel and think in ways you have not done, or do not regularly do. Well worth an ¬£8 cinema ticket. Which brings me to my next point: if you didn't see this in a cinema, you have no right to comment on the film. That would truly be like seeing only half a film, and then writing a review on it. The sound and the cinematography, simply mind blowing. After the journey begins you'll forget that you are in a theatre at all. Nolan said it was a film designed for the big screen, I have seen it once (..more than once) on both, and I can confirm Mr.Nolan is, indeed, correct. To conclude then, whilst there are people who dislike Interstellar, I can only conclude that these people are either demented clock-fanatics, infuriated by Nolan's heartless and brutal dismemberment of time, or faux-physicists who are both pedantic and stupid. Yes, Interstellar is not 100% scientifically accurate, but it is much more accurate than say, Star Wars, Gravity, Alien, back to the future, or any other sci-fi 'classic' they might haughtily regurgitate in your direction. And, yes, I can see that in some places, in the space suits especially, the speech is somewhat incomprehensible, or that the jarjar-esque comedy robots may not be everybody's cup of tea. However in my books if you give this movie less than a 9/10, you are a cretin and I hate you. This movie is unmissable and YOU NEED TO SEE IT. LIKE NOW.  seriously why are you still here.. just put that phone down and go but a cinema ticket.... Or if you have to, I guess, a DVD.in brief sending Apollo 13 to mars then Saturn passing wormholes because the traditional way would take a long time (light years obviously) accompanied by robots which look like walking matchboxes &amp; their main purpose is to tell jokes &amp; be sarcastic, all that because they've received a message from an ex-crew they've sent into anonymous galaxy telling them that they can make colonies &amp; live there, after that they find out that it was just a hoax!! They stuck in space just like ''Gravity'' while their families grow up into older grandparents &amp; have grandson's &amp; the crew remain the same then one of them decides to make a sacrifice &amp; get swallowed by a black hole to find a ''giant library'' in the space which he can contact with his daughter via ''Morse code'' by throwing books from her shelf &amp; dusting turning himself into a poltergeist then he programs her watch to help her solving an ''Integration Equation'' (she could've solve it if she had done her calculus homework though).The most beautiful science fiction epic in decades. Interstellar was an absolutely breathtaking experience for me. I thought the writing, the direction, the score and especially the acting (Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy both gave equally phenomenal performances) were all top notch. The film had the feeling of space films from the past, like 2001: A Space Odyssey (as many have said before), but I thought it also had elements of other space adventures, namely Apollo 13 and Planet of the Apes (the original 1968 film). Another thing that truly resonated with me was Hans Zimmer's gorgeous film score, that I swear he took (musical) notes on what made John Williams film music so moving, and he gave an equally immersive soundtrack to the film that adds another emotional dimension to Christopher Nolan's latest blockbuster epic. Never was the music out of place; it always fit in perfectly with what was going on. It can be its own thing from the film, and it truly tells its own story through sound, something that not many movies have accomplished in quite sometime. The space scenes in particular, have music played to that shows it very much is, and feels like this great expanse of the unknown, an infinite vacuum of an ocean that is full of many beauties and terrors. Hans Zimmer basically added to the already sweeping story of space and time, with an equally overwhelming score that I did not expect to be impacted by it in such a way. Christopher Nolan takes the audience to where they've never truly gone to before until now, through wormholes and the time distortion that black holes can make to nearby planets. It is a big yet beautifully done self-contained adventure. It is not only a fully fledged space epic, but also a cautionary environmental warning for what will happen if we don't leave the Earth when it is a desolate, dust-coated wasteland. I don't know for sure if Interstellar will get the Oscar glory like some were predicting before, but either way, I'm happy that I saw such an ambitious film that has left an impact on quite a lot of people already. It would be nice if it got a Best Picture, Best Actor or Best Screenplay nomination but I don't know for sure; however its music, cinematography and special effects will surely get rightful Academy Awards recognition in 2015. If you want a true space opera that encompasses the wonders of the galaxy, time travel and completely believable characters that need to save humanity, Interstellar is the film for you. Thank you Christopher Nolan. You are such a wonderfully talented filmmaker. Interstellar was such a wonderful gift. P.S. See the film in IMAX 70mm whenever you can, or at the usual cineplex; just see it when you can, folks!Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here. Is it a good movie? Yes. Is it Nolan's best? No.  Is it the best sci-fi movie? No.  Is it the next 2001?  Balls. There are three qualities of every Nolan film : 1)Its awesome  2)I'd gladly watch it over and over again  3)It's overrated. Interstellar manages to stay true to these points. It can certainly be said to be one of the best films of 2014 and was definitely worth the time spent on seeing this picture. The plot was good, the casting was perfect and then (as always with Nolan) there was the suspense ending which really blew my mind.Why did i use that as my title? That's probably one of the best quotes I've heard in my life.The cinematography is mind-blowing and forms a perfect combination with Zimmer's BGM.  I don't want to lay all the plot points on the table so this is a small summary.Basically the Earth is ravaged by a disease called Blight which cause the death of crops at an exponential rate such that humans will soon go extinct.Cooper (McConaughy) is a former pilot and now farmer and a father of two.He accidentally stumbles upon NASA who have discovered a wormhole which could lead to other planets that could possibly sustain life.So Cooper is recruited to lead a team to find a new planet where life can continue. After I saw the movie most people were I met were comparing this movie to Kubrick's 2001.I found that really annoying because Kubrick's work is very different from this film. 2001 is more of a visual experience. It is more of an artwork than a movie. The main reason where Nolan wins over the masses is the presence of emotions and feelings which are hardly present in 2001. Most of us want films which can take our feelings and play with it that at the end of the movie we are left crying or happy. Well,let me say that this film does play with our emotions but it also leaves us with something to reflect upon. Some curiosity of the unknown that our human species will always have about intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. Many of my friends told me that they found really hard to understand the ending but somehow i feel different. I'm not saying that the ending was not complex but it is not so difficult to understand if you have at last a basic idea of space and time. Coming back to the movie, the performances of all the actors were exceptional. McConaughy nails it with an enthralling performance which may see him win the Oscar for consecutive years.Mackenzie Foy really impresses and shows amazing potential.All other actors carried out their roles to perfection but these two deserve special mention. TARS, a bot with a comic sense of humor provides enough comedy required for this epic space drama.Also lots of awesome quotes and punchy dialogues which will have the audience applauding uncontrollably(Like I said, we are slave to our emotions and Nolan is the master). At various points in the film I was Happy,sad,curious,tense,relieved,surprised and a lot of other emotions that cant be described on paper.  This isn't Nolan's best either if you compare it with The Dark Knight or Inception. Although people argue that Interstellar got a lot wrong about scientific theories,at the end of the day isn't that what sci-fi is all about? Haven't you seen this movie yet? Well, what on Earth are you waiting for? (pun intended)A magnificent journey through time and space Interstellar is not anything like Hollywood' s mainstream blockbusters. It is something ambitious and glorious. This film is a perfect example the of modern-day filmmaking. Christopher Nolan's direction in this film is quite superb. This film is about a larger than life story. A story about the struggle of human beings. The film is quite motivating and inspiring. The film is based on a retired NASA pilot who is now a farmer. This farmer takes a journey to save humanity. The score of Interstellar is amazing in every way possible. It gives life to this film. The effects of this film were perfect. The cinematography was top-notch . Matthew McConaughey have one of the best performances of this decade. Jessica Chastain also gave an excellent performance. Overall, it's one of the most ambitious and most curious films made in the recent years.A masterpiece! Some people love music. Music is poetry set to music. By listening to music, we can reflect, recognize, put words into our feelings, philosophizing, etc. This movie is for me poetry. The film reflects humanity's aspiration, our questions of existence, our mistakes, our love. All that it means to be human. A cinematic masterpiece. The plot, the characters, the actors, the music, the environment, stories and events that affect several levels, dialogue, editing, special effects, etc. everything is of very high level! Nolan is one of the great masters of film! A perfect film does not exist. There is always some plot-hole, a weak scene or any element that does not hold all the way. But this is almost a perfect film as you can get! (A perfect film is an ideal type). Strongest in the film is Cooper's love for his own children. My guess is that the people who have their own children are affected particularly strongly by those scenes. The film's existential theme is amazing from many aspects. What is man's place in the empty space? What is life? What is time? What is spacetime? How can we understand the fourth dimension of time? Are there more dimensions (fifth, sixth dimensions)? What is our common responsibility to keep our planet healthy? There are plenty of details and rich symbolism in the film. Wormhole at Saturn: Saturn - Roman god of agriculture (poor harvest of the earth), and also the God of Time (Chronos) and cycles. Space Station as a clock (one of the film's themes is the time). Dr. Mann, who represents humanity's corruption. Shot of Cooper with his hand outstretched Which Seemed to Reflect the image of God in Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam '. The different name in the film and its symbolic significance ... And much more. An unforgettable masterpiece! I am happy and grateful for having seen this movie!Interstellar - A film who kept me on the edge of my seat The film altogether is absolutely mesmerizing both visually and acoustically. Between the immensity of this futuristic earth that is being shown before ours eyes, which is bone-chillingly close to what our future could look like, and beautiful soundtrack accompanying the scenes. My mind was left to just gaze upon the spectacle of Nolan's (Christopher) last film: Interstellar. Not to mention the absolutely heart-clenching moments where Cooper alias "Coop", starring Matthew McConaughey, has to overcome the fact that he has sacrificed the possibility of ever seeing family again in order to save mankind: that would leave any father and mother in a pool of tears. In the introduction, I have to admit I liked the fact that the film brings the reality and possibility of going back to basics in our daily lives as far as consumption and utilization of the technology around us. My personal opinion being that we are starting to forget how to not use technology, in social context and every-day-leisure. Admittedly, I'm not talking about going back to the Stone Age but taking a step back and only using technology if it is absolutely necessary. After the film I found myself thinking a lot about whether, in our current situation and online world, using technology less was still a possibility. What do you think? In terms of the visuals in the film, I believe it was extremely believable because of the fact that Professor Kip Thorne used Einstein's general relativity equations for the wormhole and natural laws of physics. That being said, there was still and astonishing use of imagination for the scene where Coop is trying to communicate with Murphy in a place where time is shown through three dimensions and he is able to literally move himself across time and space. A big thumbs for the creativity behind the set-up of that one space in space. Now, acoustically, I would have to watch the movie a second time and probably take some notes for me to be able review the movie soundtrack appropriately, but I'll talk about what I do remember. One of the most memorable scenes for me was whilst Coop was trying to dock onto the Endurance which was frantically spinning due to a prior explosion. I remember the intense organ and sharp violin notes accompanying the intensity and suspense of whether or not Coop was going to make it. The ever-continuing loop of notes kept me on edge. If I were to have to share a perfect example of a soundtrack and scene tied together, this is it. Despite Zimmer having other great soundtracks like in The Amazing Spiderman 2 or the genius behind the batman trilogy; Hans Zimmer has yet again out- done himself and really shown the world how powerful sound and music can be when tied to such an epic scene, like the one previously mentioned. I must applaud the works of Christopher Nolan, as I have always admired the way he directs and puts together his films. For example, the fact that he personally keeps his crew in-check and wanted this film to be scientifically as accurate as possible: ingenious. Then obviously, another huge thank you to Jonathan Nolan who pitched the initial idea, "merging a script Jonathan developed in 2007 with Christopher's ideas." (Wikipedia), which in conclusion created this jewel of a film.The best science fiction movie I've ever seen Although the principle of Interstellar story begins as a bit boring in the beginning of the unfolding of the film, which lasts for nearly three hours, the visuals are fantastic actors with outstanding benefits, produced the story intelligently, the fantastic soundtrack as only Hans Zimmer has accustomed us. To be be honest and in my opinion, this is the best science fiction film in cinema history, the best masterpiece ever made by Hollywood. Interstellar is no place for doubt a film that hooks you the viewer from beginning to end with moments of wonderful visual effects, but also have great moments of suspense, where Matthew Mcconaughey and Anne Hathaway are brilliant interpretation of their roles, and how not to the already well-known in another Michael Caine played a secondary role perfectly and brilliantly. For me and in my personal opinion, this is the best science fiction film ever made, and as I am a great lover of science fiction and especially the conquest of space, I venture to say it's the best movie you've ever seen. So I recommend anyone to see this masterpiece that truly represents what is the future of mankind and that this should be the priority, the conquest of space and increasingly we must venture into the known universe. I thank the director Christopher Nolan for more reward us with this magnificent film that makes lovers of the genre in that dream is the ultimate challenge for humanity, the conquest of space. By Paul MartinGood movie First time: this review is for my checklist, sorry for my bad English.. Interstellar was very amazing, incredible! The script was superb, original! The visuals and audio effects was good. The final was very good and unexpected.  I recommend this movie to all because is very good! I can watch this again in approx. 2 years with my friends :D! (ps: again, sorry for my bad English) My rating for this movie is 10/10. -- Audio 9/10 -- Visual 10/10 -- Ideas (originality) 10/10. So.. watch this movie. Raulitoftw, first review (4chcklist)Life Changing This film was, as the title puts it, out of this world. As a teen of a mere 16 years I haven't been able to see all the films out there, but this film changed my life for good. From the minute the movie starts you could feel that this was something different. You get a feeling that is drastically different to that of other sci-fi movies or space films, like Gravity or the Transformers series. The whole atmosphere is more real and accurate than anything I've seen out there. Christopher Nolan is known for doing this- creating his films so, that you can believe that it could happen somewhere on Earth at this moment. Like The Dark Knight trilogy, Nolan brings this sense of realism across very effectively. Another feature that makes this film different to others is the way it keeps the audience on the edge of their seats the whole ride. From the opening scene to the final moments I sat in the cinema with my heartbeat up high. Not to mention the soundtrack- Hans Zimmer created a spine-tingling and goose-bump-causing score that possibly trumps anything he has ever composed. All in all, this is a breath-taking film that deserves to win Best Picture in 2015.Absolutely Brilliant This is the best film I have ever seen, how others can give it less than 9 is beyond me. Yes it may not be factually correct but please remember it is a FILM. For enjoyment. This film is truly incredible, mind blowing and heart wrenching. I cry at a lot of films but I have never cried like I did for Interstellar. Christopher Nolan is an outstanding director, this film has left a lasting impression on me. I left the cinema in shock at how incredible it is. I had to write a review because it so deserves it. It deserves 10/10 I cannot fault it. Everyone needs to see this film to really understand how incredible it is. Please keep voting this highly, it deserves to be at the top and really deserves all the recognition it can get. The best film I have seen, and will ever see.One of my favourite movies of all time. I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan. I love his movies and this is one of his best till date. The movie is a perfect blend of emotion and action. It beautifully shows the complex father-daughter relationship between Cooper and Murphy. It is also one of the most scientifically accurate movies ever made. I absolutely loved it.Amusement out after the long wait!! Anybody asking how Interstellar was.. what do you expect me to say?! Seriously the brothers had done a lot tremendous work and research studying and analyzing occurrences and guessing about the future.. whether for the good or bad, never mind.. it was excellent! Needless to say about the direction.. Its a typical piece of art from Christopher Nolan! The movie's story would not be as you expect it to be. It had all kind of emotions like humor, love, fear and so on thus not making the audience become restless at any moment..! Talking about the performance of the stars.. Man Mathew!! He was great at his work!! The script, camera and each and every dialog made me so very thoughtful!! At last.. a must watch movie for engineers, scientists, cosmos lovers and anybody.. :P Gave me goosebumps..This marked the best movie I've ever watched!! :) But still worried why this wasn't on 3-D!! :/Legend Movie! It's a movie that you can easily get in between the top 10 best movies I've ever watched. It's also rare movies that can make me cry. There is not much to say. It's a legendary movie.Draws and captivates Good movie that draws you in immediately and keeps you interested. I really enjoyed it. Without seeing any previews of the movie it was thoroughly captivating and emotional all the way. Not sure if these are spoilers but I liked how "Love" transcends everything. And although the movie is epic and thoughtful like "2001: A Space Odyssey", some of the effects also reminded me of "2010: The Year We Make Contact". The first docking scene has pulsating music that reminded me of the probe sound in 2010 when it's surveying Europa and it discovers chlorophyll; and also the "aerobraking" maneuver. In addition, I agree with Christopher Nolan not liking a 3D format. I saw "Interstellar" in an older theater on a screen that is small compared to today's screen sizes and I don't think I missed any experience whatsoever.One word: Masterpiece That's right. Interstellar is the true definition of a Masterpiece. This is in my humble opinion on Nolan's Best, even better than Inception. It has everything you would expect from a Nolan movie, the -scope visuals, brains, sound. Everything we've come to love about them. But this time he has even outdone himself by pouring heart into the mix. And what we get is a movie that not only speaks to your eyes and ears but also your heart. There weren't a single dry eye in the cinema in the six times I saw the movie in cinema. Hans Zimmer score was AMAZING, I can't believe he didn't win an Oscar. The less said about it the better, experience it yourself.  The acting were all around top-notch especially from Matthew McConaughey. And I was also impressed by how well McKenzie Foy could keep up with the more seasoned actors. It's an outrage it didn't get nominated for Best Picture in the Academy Awards. This movie will certainly go down in History as one of the greatest Sci-Fi's in movie history. See it now and tell your parents about it!Leaves you feeling like no other film: This is my first review and not something i would usually do but this film does more than deserve it: From start to end this film had me gripped, the story and directing of Christopher Nolan for this film is incredible. The acting and script throughout had me feeling every emotion from excitement to tearing up.  Hands down the best film i have ever watched and with each repeat it gets better. what Christopher Nolan has managed to do here is a masterpiece that will go down as one of the best films ever made in many peoples opinions. This is a film that everyone should see at least once if not for the thrill then for the morals and concepts it brings up.phenomenal cinematic experience This movie is full of various elements that make a movie great. It is suspenseful, humorous, action-packed, heart-wrenching, and borderline perfection. It is in a way similar to Inception as it is a little hard to follow due to the many twists and turns, but it is worth it. The actors and actresses are dedicated to their roles and you can see the emotion and feel everything. I've never experienced a movie that could move me this much and move me to tears. And it's a movie about Space! It is a nod to all the space exploration movies in the 20th century and it is overall pure gold. Be sure to bring some tissues. And be sure to fall in love with all its cinematic perfection. Plus the soundtrack is phenomenal.Masterful Work of Art - Best Movie of All Time I have never felt so compelled to write a review of a movie as this one. I have also never paid to see a movie more than once. I've seen this movie twice so far, and will be going again.  If I had one bad thing to say, I would say it starts off a little slow, and you have to wait for the action to really kick in. From there on out it is constant eye candy and adrenaline with a chill inducing musical score. Tears will be shed, and not always because of sadness (though you might go there too), but most likely at the immense unfathomable greatness of the real world.  The juxtaposition between the loneliness and emptiness of the universe and the closeness of human interaction and love for yourself, your family, and the species itself is awe inspiring on so many levels.  The plot is deeply layered, and grounded in the amazingness of actual science. So much so that you might even think the movie is filled with plot holes, until you look up the science and realize truth is more amazing than fiction.  A second viewing is just as good (yet obviously different in some ways) than the first. You will see how amazingly the science was worked out, and that the minor leaps you have to take are well worth it. If not for the way it makes the story exciting and fresh, then for the visuals you'll get from it.  I've read a few other reviews, and I am dumbfounded at anyone not seeing the epic greatness of this movie. The only thing I can possibly attribute it to is that those bad reviews are coming from people who would be one of the teachers in Murph's school.When Love meets Space!!! Nolan, the perfectionist of our era has yet again delivered an epic movie in the backdrop of space exploration. He handles all the science stuff in an accurate manner where he takes us to another galaxy which is a dream for every space lover. There are some mind blowing visuals while travelling through black hole and the portrayal of the three other worlds. I particularly enjoyed the stunning view of Saturn. Music of Hans zimmer is an extraordinary pillar of the film especially the NO TIME FOR CAUTION is awesome. All the lead characters were excellent in performance wise. This movie will be researched in years to come to praise the work of Nolan. "LOVE TARS LOVE".Amazing Jonathan Hoang i'm okay with the criteria for this. it's really NOT a list of all-time classic movies,more like a popularity list based on "votes" like they said many reach the required votes the opening weekend. i fault IMDb for calling it a classic list and not a popular list. as for Casablanca and Seven Samurai? yes they are both classics as are the Exorcist,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,Silence of the Lambs and Unforgiven all modernish movies. maybe one day the way Interstellar was acclaimed by critics it will be considered a classic. as much as i liked GOTG it is not a classic and may never be considered one. but still a very popular movie.Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here..!! Do not go gentle into that good night,.. Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light..!! Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning.. Rage, rage against the dying of the light..!! Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light..!! Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night..!! Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light..!!. Do not go gentle into that good night..!! Wormhole, Black-hole, Gravity, Gentle Singularity, Stars collision, Time travel, Space travel , Space time relation, Time Dilation, Newtons 3rd law: 'You have to got leave something Behind..' Even Love, Emotions so many like these represent in a brilliant way..!! Beyond the Imagination..Extra Ordinary Journey from Farm house to Wormhole..!! Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here..!! Men opens up a new dimensions !! Its beyond Imagination and for Christopher Nolan i would say this man can do anything. Superb Journey. A must watch for everyone.Outstanding A grand spectacle . Everyone involved in the production should be proud of this .Very moving and rooted in humanity . They utilized Kip Thorne as a Technical science adviser and it shows - but you don't need to know about science since it is explained during the movie (and is accurate) - and frankly it's a human drama. Some artistic angles were used to tell a story- But it's a movie for Pete's sake .....Some of the drastic complaints I've read on this stream seem to be very angry people who wouldn't be happy if the government was giving away free money - and The G is ..... I thank everyone involved in the production ; it is the movie of our generation . Take someone you care about to see it .The worst 3 hours of my life! What a huge pile of steaming poop! I could not believe that the movie critics gave this horrible movie a 9.2 rating. The movie is slow as hell. The characters are so badly developed that you never care for them. Good actors play characters that appear in the movie juts to be disposed off soon after. The special effects are pretty weak. You see the spaceship vibrating all the time but the faces of the actors are not reflecting the shaking or the gravitational pulls. But, of course, they make lots of ugly faces. You should see the movie Stealth to learn a thing or two about this kind of special effects. The robot is the most ridiculous thing in the movie. The plot is just so far fetched that I caught myself smiling at times. Who let the writer into the cutting room?! 3 Hours! Are you serious?! Only an unabashed Christopher Nolan fanboy would have the courage to claim to have found any redeeming quality on this "practical joke". $200,000,000.00 US Dollars. What a waist!Giglia in Space on Drugs for Stupid People One of the worst movies ever. Painful. For ridiculously drugged out people or those lacking any knowledge whatsoever (take your pick) Overacted, and pretentious. Moronic actors using big words with a total lack of understanding of what they mean.  I never want to see Anne Hathaway again... ever. I only want to see McConaughey was even worse, if that is possible. I feel sorry for the actors who played small parts in this movie. I formerly had respect for most of them.  Some of the pictures were pretty cool. Too bad the dialog didn't rise to the level of the cinematography, but neither did the storyline. The characters were not fully developed in the story. It was silly.Choppy, and way too long. I went into this movie with high hopes. Glad I had a DVD to fast forward. Spoilers spoilers spoilers.... OK, the crops are dying and we have a new dust bowl, so far, so good. But it went on and on. (and on and on....and on and on) And as another reviewer pointed out, we have this secret underground NASA base just a stones throw from where his farm is. Uh Huh. OK, So, gee, he 'wanders in'..and will leave the next day on the hidden spaceship to save the world! I buy that, don't you? Now, it did have a GREAT idea, as we go through the wormhole, we 'could' pop out at a different time. Forward in time , and 'MAYBE' backward. OK, this could get interesting, could they pop out BEFORE the dust bowl and return to earth? (and save the world?) Nope. But they do find the other astronauts who went out before them, but I won't give that part away. Land on a few planets. And the robot, at first, I thought, what a CHEAP looking robot, but I took a liking to it. 'He' actually saves the day. His name is TARS. Kind of liked him. I gave it one star to balance out those 9 stars.Wanted so much to love it. I went out of the movie theater with mixed feelings. I love Sci-fi, I would have like to travel to other planets (not anymore). I wanted to like the movie so much that my brain forgot most of the bad side of it. First I said to people that interstellar was only for Sci-Fi freaks, that it was not a feel good movie (pretty damn dark and depressing) but it was overall a good movie, but my "love" of Sci-fi had block all judgment. After talking to other people who saw it, my view of the film change radically. Here are why :  1. Have you seen stupidest robots than in interstellar. 2. The pilot farmer daughter saw GPS coordinates in "dust" (yeah right) and they goes to those coordinates and "find" NASA bunker. They are abducted by the NASA and the NASA chiefs tells the farmer : you are the one we were waiting to pilot the spaceship that will save humanity... (even tough the NASA didn't sent the dusty coordinates) WTF 3. The extra being/god/or human of the future had placed for humans a wormhole... near Saturn... why so far? 4. They went to a sea planet to rescue/see those sent before. That is a sea planet with no ground to plant food/animals. Not a good choice. And, they couldn't see the giant waves from space? 5. They went to a ice planet to rescue/see those sent before(Ice planet without animals/plants...what's the point) so close to a black hole that a few hours on the planet = 23 years to the spaceship in orbit. Is that a good choice to try to establish a colony on a ice planet near a black hole? 6. The spaceship is relatively small (we could see the 2 shuttles and the ring that create the gravity). Inside the ship, there is the machine to create babies (100-10000 ? fertilized human eggs)without ? the incubators. If you find a planet, yes to the babies, but the spaceship so small that the food/baby milk would be out quite soon. 7. Have you seen so bad cryogenic bed? A kind of trash bag that wrap you up. 8. Nobody's really knows what's inside a black hole, but Nolan's view is ridiculous. Add that the the farmer go out of it and survive, to find is old wrecked house inside a giant spaceship.vastly overrated reading the other reviews here its hard to conceive that I watched the same movie everyone is gushing about. the central premise is hardly noble although perhaps quite the likely selfish outcome i.e. after trashing this planet lets go trash some others. the black hole visualizations were quite lame. this is not a great sci-fi film even remotely in the league of 2001 although a cursory superficial viewing might suggest so to an unthinking non-sci-fi buff. a great scifi film would naturally start by 1st adapting a great scifi story. these are yet to be made such as ringworld, dyson spheres and fleet of worlds concepts. to think that all these mind boggling stories exist yet this rather old and tired story concept is chosen to lavish money on is strange, although it is somewhat understandable as the afore-mentioned stories would be much greater challenges all around and so its best that they are ignored rather than poorly realized as this primarily propaganda piece.Good Space simulator with rubbish story Do not read this if you want the film to be ruined for you: my great wonder is: why would you travel back in time and change something, when the purpose is survival of humanity? So if Cooper saved people from the fifth dimension, opened time hole and engineered the entire sequence of events whereby Cooper directed his past and his daughter about how, basically, can save humanity, how were these future people saved exactly? Which is to say, you can not travel back in time and instruct your own salvation. Should we not be saved 1st, so that one can exist in the future to travel back in time? How can you make such a big film without thinking of such a thing or is it me who has missed something?please avoid being sucked into this pile of nonsense Where to start? This movie is so flawed, it is difficult to know which aspect deserves more blame. First the music is actually very annoying. Repetitive and grandiloquent, it gets on the nerve of the listener especially after the first two hours. Second, the characters are completely flat and uninteresting. Their emotions feel mechanical, and the 'bad' characters simply act erratically, as a function of the need of the story. Third, the dialogs are full of platitudes ("love cannot be measured", says the astrophysicist) or outright absurdity ("gravity can travel through time"), and become laughable at times. The worst is clearly the scenario. In addition to Marx brother's physics (relativistic effects without relativistic velocity, 300m high tides on a planet with 20 cm of water), goofy space exploration (you land first and then, you start thinking about what kind of planet it is), the plot spirals into such a pile of nonsense that it is difficult not to feel insulted. Apparently, a good physicist was hired to provide the visuals for the black hole. It would have been also good to hire a scenarist that can write a story.
Astonishingly bad plot If this had been written and played as a straight-out dark comedy - and if it had been at least half an hour shorter - perhaps it would have passed as a run of the mill movie. But since it has been presented as a serious mystery, it has committed the cardinal sin of filmmaking - that of disrespecting the intelligence and/or perspicacity of the audience. For us, the film represents a significant achievement in that it contains more and larger plot holes than any other movie we have ever seen - and we've seen many! This was even worse than Babel! That said - and a warning that reading further will take you deep into spoiler territory - the following is by no means a comprehensive list of the major holes in the plot. So ladies and gentlemen, start your engines and drive your semis straight through an impressive array of plot stupidity: 1. Amy buys a car listed on Craigslist for cash so there's no record of the purchase. How about title and license? Where does she keep the car until she needs it? How does she get to it when she needs it without being seen? 2. Amy buys lots of tech toys and crams her sister-in-law's shed with them. How does she get into and out of the shed without her sister-in-law (who doesn't like her) noticing? 3. The shed is where her husband sometimes has liaisons with another woman. They don't notice the accumulating gadgets? 4. The gadgets are bought online. Who is signing for them? 5. When the gadgets are investigated, whose fingerprints will be all over them - if there are any? 6. Desi is supposed to have broken into the house, beat her bloody and kidnapped her. There's blood all over the kitchen, but none where she would have been dragged out of the house? 7. As he supposedly leaves the house with an at best barely conscious Amy, Desi picks up her diary, takes it to her father-in-law's place and attempts to burn it in the furnace. Why? 8. How does Desi know where Amy's father-in-law lives? 9. Several days elapse from the time of the supposed kidnapping until Amy winds up at Desi's lake house. Can nobody attest to Desi's being at home during the time he was supposed to be kidnapping Amy? 10. What will be made of the video cameras at the lake house not showing anyone there for the first several days? 11. Desi was supposed to be holding her prisoner. Did nobody at the casino notice them there - including the man who thought she looked familiar? 12. Where does Amy's car wind up? 13. Phone records I: Amy makes the anonymous phone call tipping the police off to the contents of the shed. No record of that? 14. Amy scores a hole in one at miniature golf and jumps up and down for joy - which causes her money belt to fall off. This apparently was an Acme money belt on loan from Wile E. Coyote. 15. A couple robs Amy of all her money. Being the psycho she is, are we to believe that she is going to let them get away with it? 16. Phone records II. What is going to be made of Amy's phone call to Desi? Sure it was from a pay phone, but isn't it going to raise any flags? 17. Amy self-inflicts wounds - supposedly in the bathroom out of sight of cameras - to make it seem as though she has been bound and raped. Yet wouldn't the cameras show her entering the bathroom without wounds and emerging with wounds? 18. Amy winds up in the hospital upon her return. They put wristbands on her and one guesses they examine her - but they don't bother to wash the blood off of her. 19. Do they also fail to notice that there is no evidence of the injuries that would have occurred had she lost copious amounts of blood at the initial kidnapping? 20. Nick knows that Amy tried to set him up for her murder, thus opening him up to a possible death sentence. He also knows that when her plan blows up, she elects to murder someone who has never wronged her (other than being male) in order to cover up her actions which, until that point, may have been criminal - but not capital - offenses. Why does Nick elect to live in the same county as this woman, let alone in the same house? I could go on, but I realized before the movie was halfway over that I had already wasted too much of my life on it.If Fincher was looking to UNDO himself...he has succeeded. I'm only writing this review because I noticed this appears in the top 3 of IMDb's "Top Movies of 2014" at the time of writing. This in itself was enough to make me p*ss my trousers, but I then went on to read some of the reviews, after which I completely soiled myself. I'm all for suspension of disbelief, especially when watching Hollywood fare, but how is anyone buying this bullsh*t - and people are making comparisons with Alfred Hitchcock!?  It's as if the second half of the movie forgets the first half had happened. Let's look at what unfolds: Psycho woman fakes own murder and plants enough clues around to implicate her husband. All the clues are so contrived that, for a short while, even the detective suspects all is not what it seems. Meanwhile psycho wife has skipped out of town and disguised herself by dying her hair slightly less blonde and smacking herself in the cheek with a hammer, presumably to look like some trailer trash victim of domestic abuse and consequently giving her an excuse to wear Jackie Onasis sunglasses. All of this is keenly noted by the perceptive woman she moves next door to, yet despite watching her story on the news every day, her actual identity completely illudes the observant neighbour. Despite psycho woman's meticulous planning and care, everything unravels when she accidentally drops a money belt (how does this happen?) with all of her cash in it, whilst, wait for it, playing crazy golf thus tempting said woman next door to rob her, which she does with the aid of her hick boyfriend. Calculating psycho woman sits by and does nothing at this stage. Instead choosing to call up an ex boyfriend and potentially throwing her entire plan to the wall. Luckily (phew!) her ex boyfriend is so obsessed with her (no-one knows why at this stage, or even cares) that he puts her up in his lake house with security cameras everywhere for her safety. He is quite happy for an innocent man to be sentenced to death it appears, despite having a visit from the guy in which he implies that there may be more to his wife than meets the eye. He does have very expensive sheets though. Meanwhile, despite their best efforts, animators fail to make the Ben Affleck model appear in any way emotional or human. Not even CGI has any effect, so they just give up an go home. By now, no-one in the audience cares and Ben is replaced with a peace of plasticine that was left over when Tony Heart created Morph. Nobody, not even the supporting actors, notice. Just when you think things couldn't become more contrived, psycho wife ties a ribbon round her ankle and throws some wine down her top to emulate the fact that she has been raped (?), or had a miscarriage, or just, I don't know, "Was that her favourite top she threw wine over, because she looks very upset in front of the porch camera."  She then has what clearly appears to be (for the sake of the cameras), consensual sex with her ex, before cutting his throat with a box cutter and making a dramatic return to her husband, without so much as a call to the police. Falling into her play-doh spouses arms, she is then rushed to hospital, where she convinces local detectives and the FBI that she was abducted and held as a prisoner, by her ex, this whole time. Detectives and FBI suddenly suffer from complete amnesia and forget entirely about the murder set up. If she was abducted by her ex storming into the house and whacking her with a club, why does she have no injuries, is she some kind of self healing salamander. She'd only been gone for just over a week. Why did no'one notice this altercation, or the ex-boyfriend appearing in the middle of the day - after all, the neighbour noticed the door was open? Where did the several pints of blood come from on the kitchen floor? Why was the lounge area staged? Did the ex-boyfriend leave a slightly charred copy of her diary in her husband's father's oven? Even window-putty Nick has the sense to ask "Erm, how did she cut his throat if she was tied up all the time as she claims?" "To which the uninquisitive police response is, wait for it, "Can't you just be happy your wife is home?" "Yes, of course, we should invite Bundy, Manson and the Wests around and celebrate" It's good to know that all you need to do, to hoodwink the FBI is act like a damsel in distress, wrap some rope around your wrists too tightly, and re-enact a scene from Big Brother using a champagne bottle for them to forget any evidence that may implicate you in murder or conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.  I'm sorry but even as some sort of metaphor about domestic bliss or mass media, this film fails on so many levels.  Total sh*t.Dark And Twisted, Full Of Great Visual Storytelling Dark and twisted, David Fincher's stylish new mystery thriller was derived from Gillian Flynn's intriguingly slick tale from her complex and suspenseful novel. By far one of the best acting performances to have come from Ben Affleck, 'Gone Girl' boasts some strong yet disturbing portrayals from Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry and Affleck. Fincher has garnered fame and recognition as a mainstream director, that is not only able to engulf the audience within the picture, but actually make them part of the scenario. Fincher exercises upon his trademarks with the swift and stunning cinematography, the chilling score and tight editing, all of which makes 'Gone Girl' a movie full of great visual storytelling.A total mess. I guess one thing this movie is really good at is getting people to just roll with whatever happens. Well, it's also beautifully shot and well-paced. But if you are intent on watching 'Gone Girl', I dare you to stay critical. Think logical. Because if you do, the plot is almost insultingly bad. Plot: (spoilers) Woman fakes her own murder and tries to frame her cheating, violent husband for it (a divorce wouldn't do?). In the movie you're presented with the framing plot around the 1-hour mark (or far earlier if you see it coming). So what happens for the rest of the movie? A train- wreck, is what.  -The GOAL was to have her husband killed. As soon as she loses ALL of her runaway money (what was her plan once her husband was jailed, anyway?), she flees to her obsessive, creepy high-school sweetheart (who, mind you, was already similarly framed once before). Once he turns possessive (who'd have thought!), she KILLS him rather than try to flee, and manages to drive home, fully blood-clad, without alerting anyone along the way. Home, to the husband she wanted dead... right? -Upon arriving, she gives the police a terribly contrived story where she explains to have been kidnapped and raped day after day (doesn't really match with the security footage) until she (mercilessly!) killed her alleged captor. What she says hardly makes sense (interrupted several times by the one investigator who still has a brain), yet she is simply sent home. Still covered in blood. Yes, really. -There appears to be no further investigation in the past scheme of framing her husband: the countless credit card purchases stored in the shed, the diary which was conveniently left only slightly burned, the POOL OF BLOOD which was cleaned up in the original murder story (her kidnapper did all that??). The other ex-boyfriend who she had charged with statutory rape, surely he could help prove her extremely manipulative and utterly insane behavior? -Despite all this, there is apparently "no way" to come up with any concrete evidence of her crimes. No, we're not even given a remotely satisfying conclusion to this mess of a story. SURPRISE: his sperm from the fertility clinic was somehow stopped by his wife from being destroyed (even though she wanted to kill him the entire time?) and she manages to get pregnant with it (without him, her husband, being alerted of this at all). And then the credits roll, and I'm left thinking "how come so many people actually like this movie".What a terrible lump of trash. I am baffled by the good reviews. I really cannot figure out why this movie is so highly reviewed. Everything it sells itself as is a lie. For starters, it is portrayed as this suspenseful thriller where there are constant twists and turns and you never really know what is truly happening. Well, that is a total lie. There is no suspense, there are no serious or intelligent twists, just a litany of idiotic contrived absurdities. Spoilers below:  You clearly see what is happening in very beginning with Nick (Ben Affleck) and you pretty much know he did not kill his wife 30 minutes in. Your initial sense is that she is not dead and he did not kill her, and you are right. There are no more "twists. "The "twist" is that she is insane, and the movie descends into 2 more hours of ever increasing idiocy and farcical garbage. Amy (Rosamund Pike) goes off into a series of illogical and irrational behaviors, including consorting with some random trash at a trailer park, despite having faked her own death and being the subject of a massive manhunt. The story just gets more and more absurd, with more illogical stupidity and unbelievable actions by other characters, which include police getting a search warrant on a house based on an "anonymous tip," Nick and his sister being apparently the dumbest people on Earth who would not move any of the loot out of the shed before the cops find it, the police engaging in the largest manhunt ever for a missing person after about 6 hours, etc. The movie starts out decent but gets continually worse as it goes on, and just starts getting worse and worse at a faster rate as it continues. The acting is decent to middling, with Affleck probably giving one of the better performances overall, and Tyler Perry actually being an enjoyable aside. The other characters are largely unlikeable, unbelievable or just stilted caricatures. The last 30 minutes are, as others have noted, unbelievably ridiculous and moronic. The woman who so carefully plans out her own death with a massive amount of preplanning, somehow commits a savage crime of passion, which is a story FILLED with holes, but somehow is supposed to have gotten away with it. Also, apparently even though she plotted all along to have her husband executed, she somehow had the presence of mind to save the sperm sample, keep it, then AFTER he is exonerated and she has to alter her plans to return to him last minute after murdering someone else, has the means to get it successfully implanted in herself. Oh, she is an absolute psychic apparently. The ending is ludicrous, the characters are unrealistic farces that only someone who desperately wants to love this movie would believe, the story is overrun with artificial plot devices and deus ex machinas that serve only to advance nonsensical story lines, and the movie is in no way a twisting, changing thriller. Its just a predictable drama where the only "unexpected" things are unexpected because they are absolute nonsense that are make about as much sense as random dog running on stage and relieving itself. One of the worst movies I have seen in years.Shock and Awe How on earth is this film attracting so much criticism?! This is one of the best films of 2014 and people are labelling it "utter tripe", "an enormous heap of illogic and nonsense", "wish I had missed it". Are these people serious? Can we no longer appreciate - or even identify - a great film?! Gone Girl is a peerless plot-driven story about a wife who goes missing. Seems pretty ordinary, right? Well it's not. And it doesn't take very long at all for any sane viewer to recognise this.  You start watching and - as you do with any mystery - you start collecting the clues and piecing together an explanation for the events which have taken place. But no sooner than you have formed the perfect explanation in your mind is it immediately swept away in the most overwhelming twist of the year.  And it only gets better from there. Gone Girl is a roller-coaster; only you're riding it in the dark. You don't know where the next turn is, you can't see where you're headed, and you have no idea how many more ups and downs you're going to experience before it's all over.  It's a film that keeps you guessing and just as you're beginning to (once again) think you've got it all figured out, the game changes and it's all up in the air once more.  The diary-exposition format is also very clever and was executed perfectly. Many films fall victim to losing the viewer when jumping back and forth between past and present, yet Gone Girl - you guessed it - does it just right. This film ranks high in the mystery/thriller genre. It is just as compelling and perplexing as Shutter Island - if not then moreso.  And let's not forget: the acting. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike do a phenomenal job in their roles as husband and wife. Not a line feels out of place and both seem as though they were born to play Nick and Amy Dunne. By the end of the film I felt so immersed in their story that I found it hard to believe it was just a film.  All in all, I for one am thoroughly pleased with Gone Girl. I knew from watching the trailer it would be something I would like, I just never imagined it could thrill me this much. A very underrated and overwhelming story that should be enjoyed by all.An enormous junk heap of illogic and nonsense One of the most ridiculous spectacles of bad storytelling I have ever seen in my entire life. "Gone Girl" gets its title I think, from the fact that she was supposed to be done away with (murdered and disposed of) but is really "gone" psychologically¬óshe is a pure psychopath. The movie tries to tell you that she is highly intelligent, and meticulously plans to fake her own murder and frame her husband for it. Here's the pathetic execution of her plan: 1. he leaves the house one morning, and she springs into action.  2. she breaks the glass coffee table, pours about a half quart of her own blood in one puddle, in front of the kitchen sink. That much blood from a violent attack would be all over the room.  3. she flees, leaving the front door open.  4. A nosy neighbor notices the door ajar and calls the husband (somehow the neighbor knows exactly where he is.) But no one saw the wife leave. 5. The husband comes home. He has not a scratch on him.  6. he is totally co-operative with the police.  7. They eventually find her diary In a wood stove at the husbands father's house. The wood stove door is ajar and the diary is only partially burned; it really makes you wonder how that played out¬óthat the husband put the diary in there to burn but just left it singed, all that work, cleaning up the blood at home, but not to burn the book, as if he needed to make a special trip to his dad's house to dispose of a stupid book. and the only thing incriminating that she wrote was on one page which he could've simply torn out.  8. When the wife runs away, she only changes her appearance slightly and then, instead of secluding herself, she makes friends with some low-lifes, with whom she sits and watches her story unfold on TV.  9. she murders the Neil Harris character in an attempt to switch the blame to him. That would then imply he was the one that drained so much blood from her back at her home, he cleaned it up and he put her diary in the wood stove (?!)  His car wasn't seen at her house.  He then kept her a prisoner, starved and raped her.Yet she found the opportunity and strength to kill him, but didn't call the police from his house to come rescue her. rather she jumps in his car and drives all the way home.  10. upon returning home she has no wounds consistent with the bloodletting at her original house or at the hands of her alleged kidnapper.  11. There is no visit to or investigation of the alleged kidnapping crime scene¬óhouse on the lake. 12. The hospital sends her home in a nurses uniform, underneath which she is still caked in blood. This movie is just about the lamest piece of S**** I have ever seen.Utter Tripe Just seen the film Gone Girl.  I really struggled with the book and found it incredulous so never finished it but the film was getting good reviews so I thought I'd give it a go. What a pile of crap! Two and a half hours of my life wasted. The story is just unbelievable. Neither character makes you like them or hate them. They are just bland and, well, unbelievable.  By the end I just wanted someone to firebomb the house and kill the pair of them. I would have stood up and cheered. As it happened it has a really lame ending. A waste of my life. Utter tripe!Slow burner with a twist for the ages. Fincher does it again. The first act of the movie is the run-of-the-mill wife gone missing, the husband accused of killing her plot. This is clearly established in the theatrical trailer and may have thrown off some potential viewers. To the people who are familiar with David Fincher's work, this is not the case with Gone Girl. Yes, the first act is very ordinary, but the second act uproots whatever ever considered dull about the movie as it takes a rapid turn into thriller stardom, resembling something taken out of a Hitchcock movie. Only a handful directors can completely enhance the movie's narrative through editing, and Fincher is one of them. I know there is a lot of praise around Rosamund Pike's performance, which makes it easy to overlook Ben Affleck. He plays the tired, oblivious and boyish really well. This may be the very reason why he is completely overlooked. And in a time of sequels, prequels, remakes and biopics, finally a contemporary piece of work! Stellar!Sad Commentary on Film Today Thought this would be a good thriller, but ultimately it was draining and depressing. Would think any man who sees this film would never want to have sex again......it portrayed woman/women as being monstrous and men as passive, sex-crazed zombies. The story had so many loose ends and unbelievable scenes, such as where she returns home covered in blood.....then she's at the hospital - there had to be an exam, then giving an interview to detectives, then comes home still covered in blood....how much time elapsed during these scenes, and who would allow her to drive around, carry on, covered in blood for all that time? With great emphasis on crass words for women, violent sex scenes, and a score that sounded like a synthesizer importing screeches from an airport runway, this was one depressing film. The only place it was believable was in its depiction of the media and how they revel in tragedy and perversion. If this becomes our prime form of entertainment we are in big trouble. Need to watch a pre-1960 film or musical now.I can not believe people like this ~~~~~contains spoilers~~~~~~ Please do not waste your time or money on this nonsense. Oh boy where do I start. OK for me the worst thing is when she gets back and tells everyone that Neil Patrick Harris "kidnapped" her (Rosamund). He did this by bludgeoning her and she lost a large amount of blood which he cleaned up. Then he takes her diary to her husbands fathers house to burn!!!!! (how does he even know of this location)?????? But he makes such a p!$$ poor attempt to burn it which would take 5 min to do properly as opposed to the 30+ to clean the blood. and no one questions this even once!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No one even looks for any wounds or asks about her wellbeing and she is not treated for any wounds. Oh and the hospital sends her home covered I mean a copious amount blood. No flipping way, the hospital would clean her looking for wounds especially with this much blood.I could go on and on but just read the other truthful reviews they will point out most of the other glaring mistakes and downright intelligence insulting nonsense. I really wish IMDb would have a 0 or negative review number as this does not even rank a 1. I give this -5 for utter bull$h1*.Horrible the movie was just so unrealistic that it sucked i got pulled in at the start it turned out like any other mystery, action movie all the clues and other attributes etc... but there was so many thing that just are so IDIOTIC that it pisses me off.  I have had so much tension on this from the book thinking it will be amazing but it all went away half way through the movie. Spoilers: The part when she actually tries to make up the part of rape and when she puts wine on her skirt and whatever was so STUPID, WHAT ABOUT THE BLOODY CAMERAS YOU IDIOTS. And if you're going to say she disabled them, the what about the actual fake rape scene. she sucked his dick and was wearing lingerie for gods sake who wears lingerie randomly. if they looked at the cameras to watch the rape then what about the dick sucking and shirt tearing and pulling him in on you, then pulling a knife out from under the pillow.  But what finished it for me was the ending. WHAT MAN LIKE HIM IN THEIR OWN MIND WOULD STAY WITH A MURDERING BITCH LIKE THAT AND STILL LOVE HER.  This was my opinion you don't have to agree but i just found it so stupid.Maybe, maybe not David Fincher is a phenomenal craftsman. His visual style dominates every inch of the frame but why is it that I left the theater so untouched, so unscathed. I told the story to someone over dinner and I couldn't do it without laughing. This is no comedy, or is it? So, what is it about David Fincher's movies that include some shocking stuff without shocking me. I can observe without participating. Cold, maybe that's it. The passionate story is told without passion but with a feverish attention to the cosmetic veil that covers or masks the real story. I wasn't bored, just impatient and a bit put off. I admired the performances and wondered about the casting of Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry. I suspect is code for something but I can't imagine what. After all said and done, goo see it.Wow, and not in a good way... Never again will I trust the Metascore. Big fan of David Fincher, but let me tell you this movie was spectacularly bad. The score was ham handed and clashed with the film itself and I was embarrassed for the actors at some points that they had to say the ridiculous lines in the terrible script. I felt every single minute of this 149 minute movie. At one point my husband turned to me and whispered "this is really bad" and we started laughing. Then we started rewriting the story and recasting. For example, Ben Affleck could have played his own twin sister and it wouldn't have made the movie any more ridiculous. You might love it. I really, really did not.Almost as terrible as the book. It's a mistake to recruit the author to do the screenplay - they are too emotionally invested, and if they aren't known for writing scripts the disparity in quality can be obvious. Take The Exorcist III for example. Or Gone Girl. The Gone Girl novel was a lavishly praised exercise in cryptic dialogue, high school prose, and incompetent storytelling that defies conventional formula. Unfortunately, you can only defy the formula and get away with it if you are very good. Gillian Flynn just isn't.  Her characters speak with bizarre, hyperactive energy that made me feel breathless just from reading it. It's like listening to someone recall a fond memory at a party - a memory that nobody else cares about. It's inexplicably cryptic. It's not how people talk, and you can tell that on screen Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike don't really know what to make of their lines. Their sentences are too long, too wild, too verbose. They talk like stage actors fresh out of drama school. The supporting cast are also similarly lost - the two detectives especially. The female cop is just a frustrating "loose- cannon-independent-woman/symbol-of-women's-suffrage" poster girl. She talks fast and drinks coffee - black, no doubt (Yawn). Her male partner just seems to follow her around like a lost dog and nod agreeably with everything she says - three cheers for women's rights! Down with the glass ceiling!  You might as well slap a domestic violence advertisement in the credits. The lack of tension evident in Flynn's writing translates well to the screen. Your nails will not be bitten to fleshy stubs watching Gone Girl. More likely you'll end up filing them into neat, buffed arches out of boredom. Fincher can't elevate the inherent drabness of the source material. He, like the rest of the cast, seem to misunderstand the script. They just "don't get it." Gone Girl is one of those wrongly-praised cause celebres. People are too keen to jump on the bandwagon after learning about the *gasp* "shock twist" in the final act (that is hardly shocking, original, or interesting).  Re-watch some of Fincher's better work instead. If you've already invested money in the novel, take solace in knowing it is the perfect size for a doorstop, and about as entertaining.Wish I had missed it Actually a good well acted movie till the end. Ben Affleck was excellent and Rosamund Pike had me 100% convinced she was evil incarnate. Carrie Coon as Ben's twin sister and Kim Dickens as the lead detective also gave excellent performances. As for the story, I can deal with sad endings where the hero dies like Braveheart, Cool Hand Luke, and endless others. When the credits came up on Gone Girl, I could only regret spending over 2 hrs to watch a movie that left me that angry. I would have preferred she had just killed Ben Affleck and gotten away with it. Assuming the book had the same ending I would have thrown it across the room upon finishing it. I enjoyed the movie up till the end but that completely ruined it for me.Truly terrible movie. I wish I could rate this movie with a 0 Maybe the first part, is OK, before anything happens. When the action starts, you see that the acting, the plot, everything starts to go down the drain. I must say that in general the acting is very bad, and there are very stupid moments. Like when the wife returns after killing her ex-boyfriend, she is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood, telling the story that she was raped. Well nobody cleans all the blood of her in the hospital, and she is in a room with at least 10 FBI agents that look goofy, a lot of local police, plus husband, lawyer etc etc. Then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and they go home together. Then I walk out, maybe 10-15 minutes before what I understand was a awful ending. How can IMDb give such a high rating?????Unique and darkly funny Two movies for the price of one.  That's a fairly glib start to a review of a movie that I really liked, but it is true. The first half of Gone Girl is a fairly standard "did he or didn't he" mystery thriller. Then, about an hour in, the perspective shifts entirely and suddenly you realise that you're watching ‚Äì perhaps ‚Äì the most pitch-black comedy that you've ever seen.  Despite the abrupt shift, I still think that Gone Girl holds together extremely well as one whole movie. Ben Affleck's Nick manages to inspire sympathy without ever being truly likable while Rosamund Pike's Amy (the star of the show in my opinion) is brilliant, terrifying, hilarious and despicable in various combinations and occasionally all at the same time. David Fincher's direction is both classy and clever (as usual) and several scenes are particularly outstanding due at least as much to his brilliance as that of the actors involved in them. My one complaint would be over the length ‚Äì it really didn't need to be two and a quarter hours long. There were certainly a few moments, particularly in the first half, when I wished that the movie would hurry up and get to the point just a little more quickly. Gone Girl is a movie unlike any that I've ever seen before and as such largely defies further description. I would recommend this movie to all (with a warning that the adult rating is well earned) but especially those with a dark sense of humour. The darker the better.Too Many Loose Ends I have not read the book so I cannot compare this movie with the book. But judging from the fact that Gillian Flynn has also written the screenplay of the movie I trust that the movie has done justice to the book. Which might not be a very good thing to say about the book because I wasn't very impressed with the movie.  Please don't get me wrong, I like David Fincher's works. He picks up off-the-line subjects and execute them very well. Sometimes he also leaves loose ends. Loose ends are not bad because sometimes they get the audience to think more than what the movie is trying to convey. Unfortunately, this movie has too many loose ends and turns. The movie starts as a psychological thriller then turns into a treasure hunt with well-planted clues which are easily understandable; then into a war between a smart psychopath wife and a clueless husband. In the end, the movie turns into a common hate story of a husband and a wife. What surprises me in the movie is that the wife is a smart psychopath, the philandering husband also gets there gradually, being smart. But the general public, media and FBI are just dumb. How is it that FBI is not able to understand that a man gets enough time to go to his father's house to burn the diary but does not have enough time to burn it completely and still leave pages which can get him caught? How it is that FBI cannot find the missing wife? Now I am not a detective but I do know the general modus operandi of any detective agency - keep a tab on the previous acquaintances of a missing girl. Might not be a bad idea to pay a visit to one of her ex-boyfriends and Viola, there she is, living a good life. Found and case closed. More surprisingly, when the missing wife has decided to come back nobody even wants to re-look at the clues that she had planted against her husband. After all, everyone had started to doubt him. The list does not finish here. How come the camera at Desi's house can only catch her alone, evidently tortured. But there is no video of Desi actually torturing her. But no one wants to ask these questions to the wife. Only a few questions and FBI just lets her go. How come doctors forgot to check her so called bruises which she was supposed to have when her husband was supposedly dragging her? So there are too many loose ends. Is it that the makers of the movie think that the general public both within the movie and out of the movie is so dumb? Within the movie, the general public thinks of the husband as bad guy when the wife is missing. But when she is found nobody is questioning her motives and now the poor-dead-ex-boyfriend is a bad guy.  On top that, there is a supposedly smart lawyer (Tyler Perry) who is of no help to the husband besides making few funny comments. On the good side, Ben Affleck and Carrie Coon still managed to be convincing. Rosamund Pike is Okay. But that's the only good part I could see. All in all, I am a little disappointed with David Fincher. Se7en, Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button were really good movies and had given its audiences lot to think about. Unfortunately, this movie does not do that besides giving message that every man is a sex maniac and women are psychos. What surprises me the most, the book and the movie are getting good ratings.  These are only my opinions but if you still want to watch it please go ahead. After all it is your money. It does have few funny moments.Best performance of an actress for 2014! Having read the book, it was not an easy feat who will be able to bring to life the leading character of the book, which is Amy Dunne. Her character is so complex, that Rosamund Pike deserves all awards that will be coming to her. She was able to give Amy the mysterious vibe but likable aura of a socialite New Yorker. The score of the film is perfect, as it builds up suspense and the tone of the story. Great supporting performance by Ben Affleck, and the actress who plays her sister. Great ensemble cast who works together to delivery the dark humor lines in the film. This movie will definitely be an instant classic and I cant wait to watch it again!Everyone has a very different opinion As I read through the reviews and view the scores given to this movie by my fellow members I wonder if there is something deeply wrong with my perception. Or if others are drawn in by the ultra hype some movies are given before release and with that expectation start off viewing with rose coloured glasses. i.e. I saw almost everyone who acted in this movie on almost every talk show before its release. There were rave reviews in news articles both on and offline, on social media sites etc. I enjoyed parts of the movie even if I felt some of the characters did not have a good fit with others and most scenarios were not plausible. The story was interesting enough and fast enough paced to keep the viewer wanting more, but wanting is the key word here. The full air of mystery did not exist. Many areas did not leave much to the imagination and one was able to draw conclusion long before it played out on screen. Finally the ending failed miserably. Almost as if the writer reached a peak, ran out of thoughts and threw something together for a quick finish. I was very disappointed. I would have given a higher score if not for the movie's lack of a fulfilling end and the many unexplainable loopholes. Bottom line I was surprised after all the hype this movie turned out to be so very, very bad.The Horrors of Domesticity The basic premise is as old as the movies. An abduction leads to a media-circus.  Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) comes home one day to find his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing. The ensuing search and all the subsequent events, which shall not be revealed here, draw the viewer closer and closer into a complex world of everyday suburban reality and everyday suburban horror. As if it needed to be pointed out, this balance of reality and horror, or horrendous reality, is the domain of Mr. Fincher. In his clear-cut no-nonsense style he has fashioned a powerful mystery-thriller that lands somewhere between Hitchcock, Lynch, Bergman and Chabrol. Although vastly different directors, they have shared an interest in dissecting reality and human nature.  Profiting from two exceptional lead actors (doubts about Mr. Affleck's acting abilities will hopefully be dispelled), it is Ms. Pike, who reveals herself as an immensely versatile and unpredictable force in this movie. Over more than ten years Ms. Pike has played big parts in small movies, or small parts in big movies (such as ¬ÑPride &amp; Prejudice", ¬ÑWrath of the Titans" or ¬ÑJack Reacher"). Under the guise of Mr. Fincher she excels in every aspect and if any contenders for awards are to be named so early in the season, hers would be one of the first names (next to the outstanding cast of Richard Linklaters ¬ÑBoyhood") to be written down.  Visually stunning as one would expect from Fincher, with an immersive soundtrack by Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross and an editing rhythm that cuts like a knife through the tissue of the story and its characters, ¬ÑGone Girl" leaves no doubt about its craft and the deceptive nature of its source novel by Gillian Flynn. The author adapted her book into a tightly wound screenplay, that adds fuel to an already burning analysis of modern marriage and human frailty. The themes are familiar to Fincher, but he assembles them in an expertly fashion. And we are left wondering, amidst the suspense, about many of the so called estimable American values of the 20th century, that have now come crashing down under the weight of an economic, political and spiritual crisis.If Fincher was looking to out do himself...he has succeeded. Gone Girl marks Fincher's tenth feature film and his most mature work since Fight Club. Centering on Nick Dunne, a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder. The story sounds straight out of the Scott Peterson case and the film looks unlike any film I've seen in recent years. Lead by an all star cast featuring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, Gone Girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling, phenomenal pacing and perfect performances. What Gone Girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audience's psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt. It is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all. With plenty of twists and turns, Gone Girl keeps you, not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage, but the intentions of every character in the film. It is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book that's out there right now. Gillian Flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel. The dialog is crisp, the characters are multi-layered, it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesn't have one false moment in it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are EXCELLENT in this film. This is a different Affleck, a very human and realized Affleck. Nick Dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director. Harris and Perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to Affleck and Pike. David Fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth create a dreary, horrific tone for Gone Girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching. Every shot is meticulously planned, showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words. It is truly gorgeous filmmaking. And now for the score...Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch deliver a perfect score, besting their Social Network and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo score. If Reznor won for Social Network, I fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film. Overall, this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience. It is impeccably made, beautifully acted and an all around near perfect film.Just didn't care After watching over the first hour of this movie I just couldn't stay interested in any of the characters or even in the plot for that matter. In fact I was kind of hoping that his wife was dead and not just missing. I really hoped he killed her because I didn't like her character and I really hoped Affleck would die too in a shoot out with cops; and I kind of hoped he would get lucky and kill them also. Well maybe not the sidekick, he was cool. I just couldn't relate to all of the pretentiousness of the wife's family or even Affleck himself. I mean, I even hoped her parents would die because they were jerks too. About the only person in that movie I found interesting was Affleck's sister, I think her name was Margo. The movie just failed to hook me in an hour and fifteen minutes. No plot twist can recover the amount of boredom I had at the one hour mark. Plus there were some very graphic scenes that didn't really add to the movie (not all, some very well expressed how disturbed individuals were). I don't need to see Affleck going down on a chick on his first date to kind of figure out they bumped uglies. Graphic scenes have their purpose but when you over-do it, you lose value.Gone, but definitely not forgotten Wow, actually a thriller that's pretty good. Yes, it's fair to say that 'Gone Girl' is a really engrossing film. As with almost every film, it's based on a book. And, as with most films based on a book, I haven't read the book, so I haven't got a clue how well the film relates to the source material. But then I don't care. I just enjoyed the ride. 'Gone Girl' is one of those films where you don't want to say too much about for fear of giving things away and spoiling it for people who haven't seen it. Ben Affleck plays a (reasonably) decent husband whose well-to-do wife disappears. The media circus that follows then starts to reveal that the truth is far more complicated that it first seems (not to mention the obligatory police investigation). It's fair to say that what follows is a film that twists and turns, so you only really get one chance to watch it and not know what's coming. Many people don't really like Affleck when it comes to acting (even less now he's due to don the Batsuit!), but I think most people will relate to him as he gets pursued and hounded (unfairly? You'll have to wait and see!) by the media. Rosamund Pike plays his (gone!) wife with a flawless American accent. Again, you'll have to see whether she's found alive or dead. The story bounces around back and forth in time, making sure you're just confused enough never to put too much together before the film's ready to reveal what's happening. If I had one complaint it's that the film is a little too long. Perhaps ten to fifteen minutes could have been edited out at around the three quarters mark, just to speed it up. But that's a minor gripe. Basically, if you like your thrillers twisty and turny (and have a couple of hours to spare on a film that you really have to concentrate on) give this one a go.From intelligent to absurd I can't remember the last time I went from thinking a movie was great halfway through to thinking it was absolute trash when it finished, but that's exactly how I feel about 'Gone Girl'. The storyline goes from being intelligent and engaging to just plain ridiculous. The second half of the film just jumps from one far-fetched scenario to another, and the big plot twist at the end is frankly absurd. Even without the many plot holes and unanswered questions, a storyline like this was never going to be remotely realistic or believable. I'm afraid the hype around 'Gone Girl' is completely unjust. It tries to be too clever and the end result is an illogical mess of a film. The fact that they ask for two and a half hours of our time with material like this is insulting.Suck-tastic If you get bored easily with overly dramatic acting, bad crime drama, this is certainly it. Oh, and if you don't want to see Ben Afflecks dick, don't watch this. What is it with movies always flashing dicks nowadays, anyway? Everyone does it and it isn't funny! There weren't any boobies or anything, but there was Ben Affleck's endowment which was quite large.  What kind of psychopath acts this way? OK, so Ben's wife is crazy, OK, but I don't know of serial killers who think that far ahead, OK. Real life serial killers are usually fringe dwellers and not so intellectual. This is another Hollywood clich√©': that Hannibal Lecter is some kind of genius who fell from grace. Psychopathy is apparent by your teenage years, and if you aren't someone important by your mid-20's, you will be a loser for life. It has Doogie Howser, and he gets killed in the act with Ben's supposed missing wife. The movie basically lost me at this point it was so boring.plz don't make a sequel this is my first movie review and i think it will be the last unless they make a sequel of the worst movie in the history, i made an account on IMDb just to tell people this movie is waste of everything, time, effort, breath etc... one of the worst nonsense plots ever, the plot have bigger holes than a black hole in the space. don't watch it even if your life depends on it.Intense The entire staff on this film (director, producers, actors and all others) should be applauded for creating one of the most intense movies I've seen in several years. They all "spun quite the yarn" on this one. My wife and I decided to watch this on video at home and chose a dark, rain and snow type day to watch it. I think that added to the power of the experience watching it. I highly recommend watching this movie, unless you are married to a highly manipulative spouse.Amazing Amy Redefines Being Amazing This film is absolutely revolutionary. The cinematography, the score, the directing, the acting, you name it...it is AMAZING!!! Rosamund Pike did a phenomenal job recreating Gillian Flynn's iconic character. No complaints whatsoever. The "cool girl" monologue delivered a perfect balance between genius and twisted feminism.love it! Before viewing the movie, I read the book and could not put it down so I was a little nervous about watching the movie because I was scared it wasn't going to live up to the book, but it did not disappoint. I was really happy with the casting choices and how it follows the plot of the book so closely. Also, round of applause to Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike who kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie even though I already knew what was going to happen. You could tell they put a lot of hard work into it and they both fully embraced their characters and it payed off. It has a pretty long screen time of 145 minutes but it doesn't drag for a minute. I definitely think this is one of the better movie I have seen recently and would recommend.Interesting movie, but as a movie, not something realistic! I love this movie, because it made me think! I think the author of the book is tremendous, and this has some great one liners in it. However it is a movie, and someone with a Harvard degree would not kill her self because your first pick of a husband was bad! What makes the movie interesting is how clever and well written it is, thanks to the book and writer. But it is not a plausible reason. If Amy has everything in her name and all the money, she just moves on! Amy's situation happens to many women, but that is because they have nothing, no money at all! In real life this would never happen! Amy would just leave and with her Harvard degree, find a better husband. I do not think she really loved Nick, she just wanted in the end to make his life hell, and nothing else.I love the clever writing but no attractive Ivy league graduated woman would ever do this!Did not see it coming Nick and Amy Dunne, two struggling writers slash journalists, used to be madly in love. Theirs was a dream marriage, two soulmates who had found one another. In their own words they were so cute you wanted to punch them. But that was in the past. Then Nick's mother got sick and they had to move back to his home town in the middle of nowhere. Now Nick owns a bar bought with her money, she's a loner in the neighbourhood and their relationship has gotten progressively worse. And then she disappears on their anniversary and he becomes the main suspect. Gone Girl was directed by the legendary David Fincher, the man behind Se7en and Fight Club, and it shows. He has moved from the have-nots of the society to the haves, but it's still very clearly his style and skill behind the camera. Every scene is filled with meaning and every scene has tension behind it. Almost like there's always something just behind the counter. You're constantly expecting the pin to fall, for something to go for your throat, for something to happen. And for a psychological thriller, that's a great feeling. And the film in no way disappoints. I absolutely don't want to spoil the plot to you, but trust me when I say that it's going to take you for a ride. There are so many rug pulls in this movie that it'll leave you spinning. That being said, I do think that the first third of the film is a bit tedious. You get to know the people involved, there's some backstory told well enough and the initial setup is revealed, but the movie really takes off only after the twist at the start of the second act. Before that you're always wondering where the film is going and whether something is going to happen, but not in a good way. It keeps you waiting too long. It doesn't ruin the film, but it definitely tests your patience. Still, the second act more than makes up for it, leaving us with a great if perhaps a tad flawed film from Fincher. Not his best film by any means, but definitely worth a watch for all his fans.Good movie but not in par with the book The day of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne returns home to find that his wife Amy is missing. Her disappearance receives heavy press coverage, as Amy was the inspiration for her parents' popular "Amazing Amy" children's books. Detective Rhonda Boney does a walkthrough of their house and finds poorly concealed evidence of a struggle. The police conduct a forensic analysis and uncover the remnants of cleaned blood stains, leading to the conclusion that Amy was murdered. Suspicions arise that Nick is responsible, and his apathetic behavior is interpreted by the media as characteristic of a sociopath. Flashbacks reveal that Nick and Amy's marriage had disintegrated; both lost their jobs in the recession and moved from New York City to Nick's hometown of North Carthage, Missouri. Nick has become lazy, distant, uninterested and unfaithful. Boney unearths evidence of financial troubles and domestic disputes, and a witness states that Amy wanted to purchase a gun. She also finds a medical report indicating that Amy is pregnant, of which Nick denies knowledge, and a diary supposedly written by Amy highlighting her growing isolation, ominously ending with the fear that Nick will kill her.Gripping The one star reviews seem to think this was about a bunny-boiler and an unfaithful husband, when it was about gullibility, rash, unfounded judgment, spite and their consequences. I'm not surprised Fox viewers don't get it, and the consequences of this aggressive, vicious ignorance got you trumped. The cops get off quite well considering the regular "robbery gone wrong" or "suicide" conclusions for real life cases. The television opinionaters could have come straight off air with their bloviating b s and the complete lack of consequences for their actions and hyperbole. Having worked in media for over thirty years, I'd strongly suggest not instantly believing what is presented for your consumption, especially if it slots in nicely with your belief system unless there are facts, verifiable facts and actual evidence, not just words and beliefs. You might believe in magic. You might believe in the tooth fairy. That doesn't make it real.An excellent thriller made by a master filmmaker I seriously believe David Fincher is one of the most talented directors working in film today. The way he's composed and worked on such a variety of different thrillers is amazing, and has one of the best track records of a director in recent memory. Gone Girl, now a little over 2 years old, is still a masterpiece and holds up as the best of the best of the ongoing decade so far. Taking place in a Missouri town, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) are a happily married couple who are living the dream, but when his wife goes missing, and more and more clues are revealed, Nick Dunne must prove the claim of his involvement in his wife's disappearance. Fincher gets so much right with this. The tone, the editing, the cinematography, and the acting all come together so beautifully to make a near perfect film in the mystery crime drama. Twists at every turn, and a plot so intriguing it keeps you engaged for the rather lengthy 2 and a half hour plus runtime. Rosamund Pike shines as Amy Dunne, and Ben Affleck continues to impress with one of his best roles to date. I cannot recommend this film enough. It's a masterpiece made by a masterful director. Ever since it's release, I've gone back to this about 6 or 7 times. It's THAT good. Don't miss out on a sure fire classic.A gripping mystery with plenty of twists Before watching this I knew that there was a fairly major twist but had thankfully managed to avoid details and as it is so major I shall endeavour not to spoil it here even though that means not saying much about the second half of the film. On the day of Nick Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary he is talking to his twin sister about his wife Amy¬Ö and not in a good way. When he gets home there is no sign of Amy and there are signs of a struggle in the house. He calls the police and they search the house; among the things they find is an envelope labelled 'Clue One'. Nick explains that she created a treasure hunt for him on their anniversary; the first clue leads to a second then a third¬Ö then Nick tells the police that he can't solve the third; he clearly has something to hide. It isn't long before the police suspect he may have murdered Amy and the more we learn about him both through seeing his actions and a series of flashbacks based on Amy's yet to be discovered diary it looks increasingly possible that he did kill her. Then half way through the film there is a twist and most assumptions are turned on their head. From then on we learn more and more about what really happened and things look worse for Nick as both the police and the wider public become more convinced of his guilt. I'm glad that I managed to avoid spoilers as the story kept me gripped to the very end as I wondered how much of what had been revealed to the viewer would become known the police within the film. There is a dark tone throughout the film so I wasn't convinced that it would all work out in the end as one usually is in mysteries. Director David Fincher does a fine job as he keeps us guessing as to what really happened. The cast did a great job; Ben Affleck impresses as Nick; a man who at first appears innocent but clearly has secrets and Rosamund Pike excels as Amy. The rest of the cast are pretty solid too. Most of the time the sense of threat is fairly existential; whether evidence will lead to Nick being charged with murder there are some moments where the threat is very immediate and in one occasion things get shockingly violent and very bloody. There are also scenes of a sexual nature and considerable amounts of swearing that some viewers will be put off by. Overall I recommend this to anybody looking for a gripping story with some surprising twists.Will keep you guessing Wow I saw this movie with no prior knowledge of the book or even an idea what this movie was about. I was in for quite a ride. I was riveted; it was so intense and I totally got caught up in the suspense of the plot. In a way it's a horror movie, a frightening physiological thriller. The main cast was really good. Rosamund Pike was perfect and totally creepy. I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck, but he was awesome in this, as were the rest of the cast. David Fincher is a master of style, and he knows how to make almost any material absorbing. Gone Girl is an entertaining movie with a great story line, filled with memorable acting. The only fault was I felt it was kind of long, but the movie will keep you guessing and you really will not know where it will end up.Twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat Wow, I just saw GONE GIRL y'all. I'll come right out and say it because I really can't say too much without giving anything away, it's flat out awesome! The movie, based on a best selling novel by Gillian Flynn, stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as Nick and Amy Dunn and tells an engrossing tale of deception and intrigue based around the sudden disappearance of Amy from the family home in small town Missouri. In short YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE! It's THE best psychological thriller I have seen since something like The Usual Suspects or American Psycho. Affleck and Pike are stellar together and the entire cast surrounding them is equally impressive (yes, even Tyler Perry). This movie is like an onion with layers that keep you on edge and wondering what's going to happen next minute after minute. The movie is over 2 hours and it still had me wondering, "WHAT'S NEXT?!" like I said, you have to see this movie! It's skyrocketed to the top of my must see list for this year and it'll probably be something I'll be looking to see again. Gone Girl gets to coveted 5... out of 5.Amy, the wife of Nick Dunne went missing on their 5th anniversary wedding. Mystery begins to puzzled out when Nick reported to the authorities about Amy's disappearance. Gone Girl is not my typical mystery romantic film that supposed to make every faces to blush. Obviously, the film really twist my mind that it's not so usual like such previous romantic film I've watched, how they ended up with common ending.  Gone Girl gives a unique unpredictable and interesting plot from trailer to the actual film. I like how the details and the first hour of the film never give any hint what would happen next. Specially how David Fincher - the director of the film gave a brilliant ending that something I was never expecting. It is exhilarating to watch, thrillingly unique. A pinch of bad points how I got bored on the first long hour of the film how they established the life of the married couple that feels me like I can skip to the first 30 minutes of the film to get everything started.  At the end, Gone Girl is definitely a must-watch film for every mystery/drama genre fan.A Thrilling Mystery David Fincher is the man when it comes to physiological thrillers and Gone Girl is one of his greatest movies with possibly his greatest plot twist. This is a film that is admittedly best on its first viewing for the intense mystery and whodunit that anyone can be intrigued by. The reason it's so investing is because they never rule out Afflecks character as a suspect and through flashbacks you even start to suspect him as well. The flashbacks are used perfectly they fill in the blanks as they should but add to the tension and mystery. The way this movie looks at the media and outside worlds perception of events forces the viewer to think about what they're mindset would be during a situation like this and makes the movie all the more fascinating. Like I said this movie is at its best on a first viewing but they thing that's really going to get people to come back and watch it again are the performances especially Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Affleck is just so believable in this film he's perfect at conveying his characters more scum bag qualities while also being very convincing at portraying the immense stress that he isn't under to prove his innocence. At first Pike seemed like a likable character with some real emotion to her but as soon as we discover what she really is it turns into without a doubt Pikes best performance. Tyler Perry was extremely entertaining as Afflecks lawyer he had great chemistry with the cast and really makes me hope that he'll come back to more dramatic roles like this. The ending of this movie is quite divisive at first i didn't know what to think but I soon realised that were meant to feel that way were meant to feel unsatisfied with the ending because that's how Afflecks character would feel. This movie of course is directed beautifully David Fincher creates for some dream tension and heartbreak throughout the run time. While Neil Patrick Harris was good in this movie I just didn't like his character and was a pretty annoying presence.  Overall I love Gone Girl it's not for everyone but it's a deeply investing and disturbing movie that will go down as one of Finchers best efforts.  95%/ADefinitely worth watching even though it's unpleasant. What I like most about this movie is the social commentary aspect. The story is great and keeps you guessing without confusing you too much, and the characters are all equally pleasing and displeasing. But there aren't many movies that I've seen that make such a great use of their subject matter as a way to put a mirror up to the audience. My parents have been happily married for more than twenty years and they hated this movie for a couple of reasons. I think they recognized the skill that went into it, but they just didn't enjoy it, which I guess makes sense. If you're married or engaged or in any kind of serious relationship while you watch this movie you can't help but wonder, "how can I trust my spouse?" It's not a pleasant thought, but David Fincher has specifically told us that he has no problem with leaving people feeling a little bleak after seeing his movies. I'm sure couples don't want to have a conversation about whether one of them is cheating on the other or whatever, but I think this movie is saying that you need to have those sort of conversations or your marriage is going to fall apart. But it's really not a message, it's a theme that's open for interpretation. Gillian Flynn isn't saying to do this or that; she's just presenting some of the facts that people prefer to ignore and saying "do with this what you will, but don't you dare think you're exempt." I listened to most of the audio book, which is pretty long and is equally as good as the movie, but for different reasons. In the book, there is more detail concerning Nick and Amy's past. You get deeper into their characters, particularly "Diary Amy". It's actually pretty incredible how they were able to squeeze so much into 150 minutes and retain the quality of the story. In the book, Nick makes a lot of points about how much people's views on Amy's disappearance are skewed by the tropes that they see on cop shows and crime movies. This isn't really mentioned in the movie, but the motif is retained in other ways, like how we get to see the contrast of how characters like Nicole Hawthorne and Andie behave so much differently on camera than they do in real life. Public opinion is so vital to both Amy's plan of framing Nick as well as Nick's quest to prove his innocence. And in the end, it forces them to stay together so that they can be America's perfect but flawed couple. The pacing was great in the movie. You're pretty much on the same page as Nick and, like him, you're always curious to find out more about the mystery behind Amy's disappearance. It does get harder to follow once you find out that Amy has fabricated much of her diary. In the book, she was more clear on what was real and what she made up as evidence, but that was harder to grasp in the movie. The execution was fabulous. Rosamund Pike definitely deserved to win Best Actress for her performance as Amy. I'm not really that into Ben Affleck, but he was perfect for the role. He was genuine but shady at the same time. There's so much ambiguity in the performance that it makes you want to like Nick, but there's a definite danger that it's all just a guise that he's putting on to try to avoid suspicion. The minor parts were pretty good too, namely Tanner Bolt and Go. Some smaller characters got diminished from the book like Amy's parents and the woman who takes a compromising selfie with Nick. Fincher made great use of the fade-outs to set the right mood, and once again he plays with the color scheme to create an effect. Whereas in Fight Club he made everything a little grainy and off color in some scenes, here he makes the images sharp and makes all the shadows a little darker. I would recommend this to most people, particularly married couples. I know it isn't the movie you want to see, but it may be able to help your relationship grow stronger. I will warn you that there are some pretty disturbing and gory scenes. If you like an interesting story, whether plot driven or character driven, this will satisfy. There is only one aspect of the plot that people might find especially implausible, which is Amy's willingness to sacrifice her life to prove a point. I could agree to this, but you have to remember that Amy sees herself as a martyr for all married women and is an expert in the art of revenge against men. Overall Rating: 8.5/10.Gone Girl The story is about a relationship of a couple. One day, a husband comes home and he notices that his wife disappears. The police thinks that she implicates in a crime and doubts that he kill her. However, he expects that she may disguise her appearance and may try to charge with murder. He checks up on many things and he knows that she disguises. In the end, he wants to divorce. But she wants to keep marriage life and he don't know what she think. The film has dialogue and colors. The genre of the movie is crime, drama and mystery. I think it can change a point of view according to sex. Because many people sympathize with same sex character. In addition, I think that the film's main theme is what is a married couple and focuses on marriage.Guilty until eaten alive If there's a better example of how quickly people can turn on you, I'd love to see it. This movie might not have a serial killer, but it has pretty much every element that a great horror movie has. Relatable main characters, check. Suspenseful atmosphere, check. An engaging story, check. A psychotic villain, double check. Not only does this movie have all of those things in spades, it also has an awesome social commentary undertone. It might not be 100% accurate, but the way almost everyone in the universe turns against Nick is pretty freakin' accurate. I think as a species, we just naturally jump to conclusions, it must be some kind of primal instinct. Even though a majority of the evidence points towards Nick killing his wife, it's circumstantial for the most part. That doesn't really matter to the media though, does it? They jump on the story like vultures and make it their sole purpose to present their opinions as fact. Like it or not, that's what about 99% of the media does, it's a necessary evil. The themes and horror elements combined with David Fincher's attention to detail is a match made in heaven. The ending might not be happy, but it's horrifying if you really think about it. Nick can't leave Amy, because if he does the entire universe will hate him, but if he stays with her, he can never mess up again because then the whole nightmare'll start over. It's a perfect way to end a cleverly disguised horror movie if you ask me. Also, props to Fincher for getting an amazing performance out of Tyler Perry."Gone Girl is a compelling picture with an impeccable pacing, and features superb performances overall." I cannot say that I do not have a remote knowledge of David Fincher's filmography. Out of his ten feature films, I have only witnessed four (Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network and Gone Girl). And I have only seen them once (except Gone Girl) for each. David Fincher is so well tied-up with making movies that anchored to a distinct visual kind and malignant dark themes. His "The Social Network", which is largely a biopic, is also dark in its story. "Gone Girl" is obviously without exception; his signature movie-making style retains, but this time falls through within the strife of a married couple. On their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) returns home only to discover that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), goes missing. Her disappearance attracts strong press coverage; and after days of investigation by the police, they discover pieces of evidences which only conclude that Amy is murdered. Financial problems and signs of Nick being the abusive husband lead to him being the prime suspect of Amy's murder, although he constantly denies any wrongdoings. But what could have had happened to Amy? Murdered? Kidnapped? "Gone Girl" broaches the unexpected. It rarely allows us to expect what is coming. "Gone Girl" boasts interesting images, especially for scenes that were shot indoors. The result for its cinematography matched the common tone that Fincher had brought in for his past works. It is dark, intimidating and undeniably beautiful. The images consistently and confidently suffused throughout the running of the movie. Indeed, cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth understands Fincher's own visions. David Fincher brought the best out of Ben Affleck, Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens in what they could deliver for acting on screen, but it was Rosamund Pike who was triumphing over the stars. She was incredibly convincing in all Amy's different persona ‚Äì the good wife, the depressed wife and the villain. I dare say, the movie is worth watching for her performance alone. I have not seen her past performances, but I am convinced that her work for this one is one of her, if not, the best. Really, it is like an untainted, near- perfect performance by an actress. It is uncommon for the writer of a book, which is going to be adapted into a film, to be attached fully during the process of making the movie. Gillian Flynn, the writer, led the screenplay of the film. It was her first time on being a scriptwriter, and the script is a great one; it is smart, but not conceited. The superiority of her screenplay is that it never seems undercooked or overcooked but just right to allow the story to flow naturally. "Gone Girl" is slightly a drama and mostly a thriller. The story paints a picture of the life of a married couple, but greater concentration is being invested for the case and its development regarding Amy's disappearance. "Gone Girl" is a compelling picture with an impeccable pacing, and features superb performances overall. David Fincher had once again earned himself a fine addition for his superb filmography. "Gone Girl" surely an unmissable yarn. (Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)Deliciously Disconcerting 4.5 Stars out of 5 David Fincher is the only director for the kind of story. If anyone else had directed this, it wouldn't have been half as good. Like all Fincher movies, it's complex, adult, disturbing, mid-budget, and buzzy. It's got the cold colors, the nihilism, and the passionate acting one would expect. It's about a man, played by Affleck, accused of killing his wife, played by Rosamund Pike, a crime which we know from the start of the film he did not commit. In a normal film, if we know someone didn't commit a crime, it makes the film less interesting. Not here. This film isn't about murder, not really. What is it about? Marriage, mostly. Most every theme in the film, from deception to betrayal to compromise, can be considered to be a part of one big social commentary on marriage, particularly modern marriage. Of course, it's deeper and more complex than that, and there are many different angles to discuss, but this a review, not a reaction piece titled 'What Gone Girl Says About Marriage in America' or something like that. Like a lot of Fincher movies, it's very narrative and very talky. It doesn't help that the author of the book wrote the screenplay. That's not a complaint, mind you: just an observation. There are a couple scenes I wish had more time to breathe, but the mood Fincher's able to project more than makes up for it. It's not really different from a normal Fincher film in that regard. As it's so narrative, I won't spoil any more plot details, but I will say the plot is very juicy and very worth digging into. Everyone delivers virtuoso performances. Probably my least favorite performance of the film comes from Affleck, though I will admit that his underacting is a conscious choice and part of the character he's playing. The most surprising performance comes from Tyler Perry, who does a bang-up job as Affleck's defense attorney. I wanted to see more of his character. I would watch a full movie centered around his character. I'm not sure whether Fincher comes off as a cold director because of the films he picks, or if he picks his films based around the knowledge that he's a cold director. Either way, he's extremely good at making the audience feel full but unsatisfied. Of course, one of his movies was based off the Zodiac killer, who was never found (unless he's really Ted Cruz), so that's sort of a prerequisite. You never feel cheated, but you never feel like you get the ending you wanted either. The media factors into the film. It's made clear that our protagonist is receiving few favors from any outlet, but thanks to the Law of Conservation of Detail, special attention is given to one show run by one horrible blonde lady. Even if we didn't know that he didn't do it, that show would still make me sick to by stomach. It's like the unholy lovechild of Lifetime and Fox News. Media manipulation has always fascinated me, so I'm glad they included this. I actually hate the media in this film more than I hate any of the mains, and one of them's a psychopath. If you took The Hunger Games, took out the Hunger Games (the event), and had someone with a cynical worldview write it, the result would look something like this. When all the Oscar-bait and empty summer blockbusters are busy being forgotten, movies like this cement themselves further into the public consciousness. You can't forget them. They're unique and artful and chilling. They stick with you,  Sharp, well-paced, cruel, twisted, stylish, delightful, and poignant, this is one of the best films of 2014. Give it a watch.wow WOW¬Öand nothing short of. Let me start with this, this a romance/mystery suspense/thriller/who- dunnit/ conspiracy/drama movie. OH MY GOD! What a beautiful piece of work by the hands and imagination of Gillian Flynn and a standing ovation and credit for the producers in asking Flynn to write the script based on her own novel, a step I thought was pure genius. To create different-genred stories woven into one whole story was breathtaking, it was like watching three or movies in one, all in a package of two and half never-boring hours. The story was so smartly written that while watching the movie you can kind of predict or guess two or more different scenarios this story could go to and I bet you might just get close to one, you think the story is going in a certain direction that it just completely goes in the opposite or just another way, and then just when you think oh okay it's going this way now, it changes again.  Fincher's marvelous work strides in parallel between a loose method in the romantic scenes and the good old days in the lives of Nick (Affleck) and Amy (Pike) and the more strict, sharp, and abrupt direction and editing in the troubled times that Nick faces, which is even evident in the opening credits, just as soon as any name filters in, it fades out. Fincher keeps up with his style of dark, not-so-lit, dry colored scenes, even the paparazzi and TV show scenes don't look glamorous and that is just one of the themes of the movie, how media destroys your life. "Marriage is hard work", is another important theme, when Amy thought their fairytale love story did not need hard work and was not hard work, how wrong was she? Nick cheated on her, abused her with his spending, and simply got lazy after being laid off from work, not only lazy with his professional life but lazy with his love life as well, on the other hand, she too was an uppity snobbish woman who controlled Nick's life, and this caused the major imperfection of their marriage which in turn kick-started this whole conspiracy thing on behalf of Amy to the point of the ridiculous and silly. Nick passes through a humiliating phase, from an employed man who got married to the love of his life to a media circus freak, she goes from a rich woman to a disguised country girl, having to hide out in some motel, conspiring to get her cheating husband not only punished but executed, that is one sick revenge ploy, hehe! which brings me to the most beautiful twist of all to me, the ending¬Öspecifically the end scene where Nick and Amy are on that TV show presumably faking their intentions and lives and pretending all is okay, but at the same time, for the very first time since their troubled times, you actually see that they both have matured throughout this horrendous ordeal and journey, they both have stuck around to commit to their responsibilities towards one another as partners and lovers, for the first time we see them after a long tiring and excruciating journey of 'working hard', his responsibility is for the baby on the way and his wife who killed her ex-boyfriend to save him from the inevitable death row and her responsibility for the man whom she still obviously loves. In the end, they both paid pricey and costly for their mistakes for ruining each other's lives, for not being responsible for not putting the effort to work on their relationship. He certainly paid his due with surviving the circus that the media has turned his life into and she paid hers by killing another man to order save the life of the man she loves, Amy: "I had to fight my way back to you". Ultimately they became better people but by all the wrong means.Quickie Review: Gone Girl Much like The Game, Gone Girl requires you to suspend your level of disbelief by quite a bit in order for you to enjoy it. The events in the movie aren't necessarily impossible, just highly improbable, which can be a problem when you're expecting a realistic and grounded thriller. Even so, Gone Girl acts as something of a swansong to thrillers made in the 90's in which ordinary people were caught in ordinary circumstances and, before you know it, you've uttered the phrase "they don't make movies like this anymore."  Twisted, dark and surprisingly violent, Fincher's 2014 offering is a stylish and slick tale that kept me engrossed for around two hours. Some pieces of dialogue felt forced, other actions felt contrived, but overall it's a thriller/drama well worth watching. Despite numerous plot inconsistencies, I found that I came away from the film feeling satisfied¬Öand yet slightly hollow. Maybe the bulk of my negative feelings are towards the last half an hour of the movie, where it really got weird. I heard this was changed from the source material too.  It's pretty funny though, seeing confused feminists rant and rave about the film, unable to decide whether it is pro-feminist or anti- feminist. Best Scene: BoobsGreat and intelligent thriller Gone Girl is yet another great accomplishment by one of the best directors working nowadays.. Ben Affleck plays a complex role and truly realistic..and Rosamund Pike, for me, is a revelation, she's an extraordinary woman and her role is amazing! It captivates you from right the beginning! Boom..this is my state of mind after I saw this film. I would watch it again and again and so on... In my opinion this movie is absolutely fantastic for it's plot twisting and for incredible facts. I am really enthusiastic about it so I invite everyone to watch it!It gets completely under your skin and I think it's the best thriller movie of 2014.Not bad... But not even close to Fincher movies.. Is not a bad movie. But the story is kind too much predictable. And has bad poor "plot twist". Its good to pass some time, but doesn't look like a Fincher movie.so bad plot, so sudden ending This was a bad plot, too many gaps, and a sudden ending. we were like what happened now?Movie One of the most brilliant transcripts, I've enjoyed every minute of the movie...Mysterious Great movie. Mysterious yet not scary. Would watch this againFor the Pessimist I watched this with my wife which was the biggest mistake ever. It's super depressing, makes you think love has no hope because every relationship will evolve into an endless cycle of manipulation, where one party is playing their agenda. It's a movie you watch on Valentine's Day when you're single. It's a well made movie so I give it 2 stars. Overall I hate it because the experience was negative and I despise depressing movies.JUST WATCH IT Gone girl is really great. I don't really want to go into any more detail than that because the best way to watch this movie is with next to no knowledge of the plot because oh boy does this thing throw more curveballs than Babe Ruth (I don't watch baseball but I'm pretty sure he used to be top shit in that field). The constant twists and turns of the plot paired with David Fincher's flawless direction and some of the best acting I've seen in a very long time, coming from Rosamund Pike in particular, will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Seriously, watch this movie.The right way to write noir movies Years ago, the story of Scott and Lacy Peterson was in the spotlight. Lacy disappeared from home, and Scott was the murder suspect. I can't remember what happened to Scott, and I don't really care. I think this movie is based on that highly publicized story.  But, it's definitely not that. It's a noir movie that keeps you guessing to the end. I heard there is also a book that I can't read anymore. The movie is that perfect. The story is an abduction drama, but then it's also a roller coaster and I was glued to the chair. There are two main stars in this movie, one is Fincher, the other is the writer. But, that shouldn't take away the acting performances. I loved Rosamund Pike whom I though was just someone who makes a great Ingrid Bergmann impersonation. Well, I'm happy her part was substantial. Without her and Ben Afleck, this would have fallen flat. I cannot spoil this movie, because there are many surprises you don't see coming.From The Girl Who Wants It All Movie Review: "Gone Girl" (2014) Director David Fincher's latest movie comes along in tight-gripping 140-minute-cut by Academy-Award-winning editor Kirk Baxter, when leading cast all up front Rosamund Pike in a role of a life-time as fucking amazing Amy Dunne and Ben Affleck beating exactly for what he came for in hopelessly-failing attempts of making sense to his one-of-another disappearing wife, carrying the picture on his shoulders to become a victim of his own crimes and misendeavors to make love and get loved again in an inevitable relationship between a woman &amp; a man, so sharply-analyzed by best-selling novelist Gillian Flynn, who then felt compelled to deliver the ready-to-shoot screen-adaptation herself. Cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth and Production Design by already Academy-Award-honored Donald Graham Burt become a relentless forcing cinematic vehicle to show off David Fincher skill of controlling the image systems of his pictures since "Se7en" (1995) starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman inside out to deliver ensuring smash hit movie in Fall 2014 for distributor 20th Century Fox, even after three and half years highly-recommendable for revisits due to down-to-the-bone truthful as satirical views on the human condition, where exposure of secrets creates the weapon of choice in "war of the roses" between male-female revelations down to blood, which seemingly never gets old to begin with. ¬© 2018 Felix Alexander Dausend (Cinemajesty Entertainments LLC)Brilliant thriller Brilliant thriller, filled with all the usual David Fincher twists, mind games and clever manipulations. Great plot. While most stories give you a feeling that there is some way out for the "good guy", here the "good guy" seems doomed, once the wheels are set in motion. Furthermore, you are never sure who is the "good guy" and who the "bad guy". Even once the twist is revealed, you feel there may be another in store. Very un-Hollywood ending too, which is good. Superb performances by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, especially. Pike well-deserved her Best Leading Actress Oscar nomination. A searingly brilliant performance by her. Good support from Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon and Kim Pickens. Only negatives, I feel, are that the big twist came too soon. I would like to have been kept in suspense for a while longer. Plus, knowing Fincher's other work, especially Seven and Fight Club, I was expecting a big twist near or at the end. When it came it was gradual, and felt a bit flat. Still a good ending, but it felt like I was being brought down gently, rather than with a jolt.The best film of David Fincher. Director David Fincher has completely outdone himself with this psychologically chilling masterpiece. The film delivers in every way. Its superbly directed, has great cinematography, is written brilliantly, and contains phenomenal performances by its two leads and the entire supporting cast matches them. My only gripe is the casting of Neil Patrick Harris as a stalker. I feel like maybe someone more intimidating would have made his role way more memorable. But then again I might be biased because I am a big fan of How I Met Your Mother so I can only see him as Barney.this movie sucks big time This movie is not a good movie. the ending of it is absolutely rediculous.. the police story has not one single input in the movie,neither does the attourney. you can try and keep up with all that happens but in the end it will be a total waste of time. do not watch this movie and expect to have a nice time,cause after it ends you ruined 2 hours of your precious time..Could've been so much more The plot had amazing build-up, the cast was superb and the suspense was certainly there. Unfortunately, the ending was a completely anti-climactic, and there were so many amazing opportunities to build on the ending that were missed. It just felt like I wasted precious hours of my life watching this; I wouldn't recommend it.Fincher makes this worthwhile GONE GIRL is another epic-length feature from director David Fincher, in which he gets into the nitty gritty of the material like few other directors can. This one's based on a bestselling novel about a wife's disappearance in which the finger of suspicion falls on her own husband. It's a good whodunit-style mystery which twists and turns throughout and keeps you surprised with some unpredictable moments, but I did find it rather long-winded and suffering from a lack of likeable characters. In Fincher's hands it's an enjoyable film, and it's certain that both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike rise to the occasion to deliver lots of intense character moments. But at the same time I didn't really feel anything about what I was watching, and some of the moments feel very artificial and contrived, as if they could only come from a writer's mind rather than happen in real life.SAY WHAT? Make sure you use closed caption. Mumbling is at a premium. I am not sure where people talk this low in real life, but they certainly perfected it. I always thought you were supposed to care for at least one of the characters, but that also seems to be lost somewhere along with the use of the English Language.I am still trying to figure out why this movie is so highly rated. I even created an IMDB account just to post this.  The movie is so full of holes it astonishes me with its 8.1 rating.  It has a great structure and an even better storyline. But the execution is poor. The holes in the ending are huge. I wanted to like this movie, but the last bit of the movie feels like it was rushed. The "Murder Scene" in a real situation would have been immediately labeled as set up based on blood splatter analysis. Where are her recent, 30 day old wounds that caused her to bleed so much? How did she get a box cutter if she was constantly tied up in Desi's house? How did Nicks sister not notice Amy loading her shed up. How did anyone not notice it? Where is the CCTV footage from the Casino or Desi's house? Why was she allowed to go home while covered in someone else's blood? A woman who was captured for weeks and raped, leaves the hospital covered in her "Captor's" blood willingly? Nah. The feds never bothered to look into her recent spending habits that would literally say "I am trying to plan my own Murder." if they did. I could keep going, I'm too annoyed by the movies success to bother though. Sure, movies still have holes. It happens. But this movie has more than it should for its level of praise and the holes are so simple.Silk Purses and Sow's Ears When beautiful thirty-something Amy Dunne disappears from her home in North Carthage, Missouri, her husband Nick, a writing teacher at a local college, falls under suspicion of her murder. It quickly transpires that their marriage was not a happy one; Nick was having an affair with a teenage pupil and there are also suggestions that he may have been a reckless spendthrift and a perpetrator of domestic violence. The case arouses considerable media interest, as Amy was the inspiration for a series of popular children's books written by her parents. Although bloodstains are found at the housed, the main weakness in the police case is the absence of a body and the investigating officer, Detective Rhonda Boney, wants to give Nick the benefit of any doubt. When, however, the police uncover Amy's diary, which reveals that she was living in fear of her husband, Nick is arrested and charged with murder.  At this point, about halfway through, "Gone Girl" appears to be turning into a standard whodunit-cum-courtroom-thriller which will doubtless end with a climactic trial scene in which the truth about Nick's innocence or guilt will be revealed. That, however, is not how the film plays out. Now comes the first in a number of plot twists: Nick is not only innocent of Amy's murder, she has not been murdered at all. She is, in fact, alive and well, having arranged her own disappearance and framed Nick for her murder. (My apologies to those who don't like spoilers. This is the sort of film it is virtually impossible to discuss without writing a spoiler.  There are some good things about this film. Rosamund Pike is good as Amy, as is Ben Affleck, an actor who in the past has not always been a favourite of mine, as the hapless Nick. There are some decent supporting performances, especially from Carrie Coon as Nick's twin sister Margo and Kim Dickens as Rhonda. David Fincher handles the direction and there is some effective satire directed at the media which take an obsessive interest in the case and an irrational dislike to Nick, whom they automatically assume to be guilty long before the police have even formally charged him. (In Britain, in order to guarantee a fair trial, we have laws preventing the media from commenting on cases which are still sub judice, but the American courts have always taken the view that such rules would be an impermissible breach of the right to free speech).  And yet this is not a good film. It is difficult to make a decent film without a good story, and that is something which "Gone Girl" conspicuously lacks. I have never read the novel on which it is based, so do not know how the story would work on the printed page, but it never works on screen. The main problem is that Amy never emerges as a remotely credible character, and the fault lies not with Rosamund Pike but with the way the story is written. Nick is indeed guilty of infidelity, but the other matters of which he is suspected, especially matrimonial violence, turn out to be inventions of Amy who wants to make her diary as damning as possible. If Amy had wanted to punish Nick by obtaining a divorce we could have understood her, even sympathised with her. What we never understand is why she should have conceived so violent a hatred for him that she wanted to see him executed for a murder he never committed, a fate most of us would not wish on our worst enemies.  Amy's original plan was to commit suicide, thereby providing the police with the missing piece of evidence, her body, thereby sealing Nick's fate, although it is never explained why she thought that a forensic examination would not reveal that she died by her own hand, thereby securing Nick's acquittal. Nor do we ever understand why she should abruptly abandon this plan and return to the husband she so loathes and despises, explaining away her disappearance as the result of a kidnapping by a jealous ex-boyfriend (whom she has conveniently murdered in the interim). The only plausible explanation is that she is completely deranged, but even as a psychological study of madness the film is never convincing. (If Amy is indeed mad, we never discover how she became mad in the first place). The best actors, and the best director, in the world will never succeed in making a decent film out of a story as badly written as this one. Silk purses and sow's ears come to mind. 5/10Gone but not forgotten Gone Girl features an astonishing performance from British actress Rosamund Pike as a former New York socialite Amy Dunne who one day suddenly disappears on the day of her fifth wedding anniversary. Her husband Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) becomes a suspect, the media circus descends and demonise him, neighbours turn on him and skeletons pop out from his cupboard but not his wife's body. As Missouri has the death penalty and Amy's diaries reveal an unhappy marriage, Nick needs the aid of an ace criminal attorney. The film has a tangled plot because it has an unreliable narrator. What starts as a missing person's case becomes more complex, as Nick fights for his liberty we find out what really happened to Amy. Director David Fincher directs a muscular taut thriller with dark comedy elements. It does have flaws especially with the supposed abduction part involving Neil Patrick Harris's character which does not come across as plausible.great book, good film Watched half an hour of this the other night on TV. Then deleted it - half the dialogue was inaudible. I'm sure that wasn't the case with the cinema film, which I enjoyed. What happened to the sound on transfer to TV?Great film. Disspointing ending On his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Affleck) reports that his beautiful wife, Amy, has gone missing. Under pressure from the police and the media, Nick's life begins to crumble. Soon his lies and strange behavior have everyone asking did Nick Dunne kill his wife? This had me on the edge of my seat right the way through. Very good crime drama. Just the ending (semi spoiler alert as you'll know this is not the ending) I would have loved, after the money flies in at the end and the Bar is franchised, would have been great for Nick to say to Amy ..... 'we did it' !! Long film. Not bored once. Really enjoyed itA fairly original gripping murder mystery 'Gone Girl' is a hard movie to review - I really don't want to give away too much, because the less you know, the better. I'll say this much - it's a very engrossing mystery/thriller, that's for sure. Certainly lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing and engaged throughout. The main problem is the length - at over two &amp; a half hours, I feel like it could have been wrapped up in a double 'Law &amp; Order'/'CSI'-like episode (i.e. one &amp; a half hours). Sure, it's moody and suspenseful, but it definitely drags at times. The ending is a little ridiculous, but fits with the rest of the film. On the plus-side, the acting is superb, with Affleck &amp; Pike doing the majority of the heavy lifting and truly lending gravitas to their characters. The support cast is also great - Coon as his sister, NPH as the ex-boyfriend, Perry as the lawyer and Dickens as the detective. The Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross score is again ominous and fitting, if a little bland at times.Should have been an 8. Let down by the last 30 minutes Firstly, I would recommend that people watch this film. For the most part it had me hooked with some interesting ideas and nice plot twists. Affleck was good at walking his character along the line between likeable and unlikable (probably because this is the way that Affleck comes across in real life), and Pike's acting was sound until towards the end (which I suspect is more to do with the directing than Pike's acting skills).  Sadly, the film was let down by the last 30 minutes, which came across as rushed and/or overly edited. The storyline became totally unbelievable and I was no longer able to suspend my disbelief. Which was a shame because I feel the potential was there.  So here are the SPOILERS... These are the plot holes that I took issue with: 1. Why did Amy suddenly lose all ability to be duplicitous when being interviewed by the police when she had managed to "keep in character" for months or even years before this? 2. Why did the police/feds not see anything unusual in her behaviour, especially as we had been made to focus so heavily on Nick's behaviour earlier in the film? 3. Why did the doctors let her return home with her husband so easily when she had said how afraid of him she was? 4. And why, oh why, did Nick stay with her when he knew she had committed murder and tried to get him arrested and killed?!!! I think there would have been scope to justify the last point through Nick's desire to keep the house and bar but this was never effectively conveyed. I also feel that Nick should have been darker in character, which would also have helped justify the end.  Ultimately, I really wanted this to be an 8/10 but, alas, I really don't think it is.Into a trap. If someone carefully plans to attack someone, there is no other way to avoid it. Especially if the person planning the attack is considered socially weak, for example, a woman, an elderly person, or a child, no one would doubt it. This film shows how shocking it would be if a person who was regarded as a socially weaker was identified as a sociopath or a psychopath. In the last scene of the movie, it is not a little unreasonable for the wife who returned home to set the case to end without suspicion by the FBI. Because it turned out to be true that her husband, Nick, made statements about amy, and Nick heard about other men who had been set up with amy, but nevertheless the investigators could ignore them.Nails the tone, but the book's flaws remain Some movies fall short of the book versions, and - very rarely - some movies exceed the books that inspired them. This one? About the same, honestly. Gripping for the first third, electrifying for the middle third and crippled by its implausibility over the last third. Fincher nailed the tone perfectly, though, and that certainly did not hurt. Pike nailed it too...you almost forgot how ridiculous the character was.The book stunk so how could the movie be any better I agree with the review by Tommy Bott, even though I didn't see the movie. I read the book. That was enough. I would not waste my time watching the movie.For everyone complaining about plot holes I do understand that there were many plot holes in the movie. But all the people who gave this movie one star simply don't get it. The plot holes were exactly the point of the movie.  Amy's plan was flawed she had many holes in the story but they went unnoticed because of the big media attention. And the movie had an open ending so we don't know if the case was closed or not. Maybe they will find out about her lies and arrest her. We don't know. That's the point. Instagram @punkifex880 reviews and counting.... I just saw "Gone Girl" tonight. However, by now this will be the 880th review, so I will try to be very brief. After all, just about everything that can be said about the film probably has. Suffice to say I liked the film but think its extremely high rating on IMDb is perhaps a bit higher than I'd rate it. It's good...but I can't see it as the 140th best film of all time. So what did I like? Well, the Nancy Grace-like 'journalist', Ellen Abbott, was terrific and I am happy about anything that makes Ms. Grace look bad. I also liked most of the acting. I actually thought Ben Afleck was really good. The plot also reminded me a lot of a great old film "Leave Her to Heaven". But I also felt the film was too graphic--too bloody and too much nudity for me to let a kid or teen or even more see the film. Overall, an impressive film but not among my favorites of 2014.Fincher Once Again Comes Thru Gone Girl (2014)  **** (out of 4) David Fincher's adaptation of the best-selling novel about a husband (Ben Affleck) who finds himself under media scrutiny when his semi-famous wife (Rosamund Pike) goes missing is certainly something twisted and wicked but what would you expect from this director? I went into this film knowing nothing of the story, outside of the wife going missing, so I was really along for every twist and turn that the story threw at us. Obviously, with this type of mystery, it's impossible to fully discuss it without spoilers so I will avoid that for any new viewer. With that said, there's no question that Fincher can handle a bizarre mystery like this but what makes the film even more memorable is the rather sly and bitter social commentary on the media and how they'll destroy anyone just for a good story and ratings. Fincher is too smart to make the social commentary stick out like a sore thumb but he does manage to put it in the film and play it off well with the mystery that we're watching. The way the film unfolds is so brilliantly done and edited that you can't help but be wrapped up in the mystery one moment, cheering for one character the next minute but then a second later be feeling something completely different. The film had a rather laid back approach and it clocks in at nearly 150-minutes but the roller coaster ride is there from the opening scenes to the closing one. Again, I'm going to avoid spoilers but you and your date will certainly be discussing the outcome and events for months.  What really helps are the terrific performances including Affleck who once again proves he can act whenever he wants to. This is easily the best performance of his career and not for a second do you see a superstar but instead you see a husband who is facing the biggest stress of his life. Pike is another standout as the wife who will certainly go down in history as....well, I can't say it because it would spoil too much. Neil Patrick Harris is also very good in his supporting role and even Tyler Perry brings a certain style and cockiness to his role, which was really needed. Carrie Coon as the sister and Kim Dickens are also stand-outs.  GONE GIRL, due to its story, has a few moments that you might question and there's no question there are some major twists and turns along the way. What's clear is that this script and cast could be given to a dozen different directors and I think it's safe to say that ten would probably really mess it up. It's the type of story that one false move in the directing department could lead to a train wreck of a movie. Thankfully Fincher is smart enough to pull the material together, bring his style to it and deliver a very memorable film that keeps you guessing, and most importantly thinking, up until the credits roll.Another David Fincher winner and one of the year's best David Fincher to me is one of the most talented directors around today, and while Se7en from personal opinion is his best film Gone Girl is up there with his best. Fincher directs with his usual superb class, giving the film great style and keeping the story alive(Gone Girl is easily one of the year's best directed films), and the whole film looks absolutely great with brooding lighting that evokes the creepy atmosphere brilliantly and Gone Girl is also a film that makes good use of digital, after seeing many directors over-using or cheapening it it was refreshing to see the technique done with taste. Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross's music score gives the film a haunting vibe and adds much to the unsettling intensity that a lot of the film(at least two-thirds worth), managing to not do it in an in-your-face manner. The use of sound mixing was interesting and came off cleverly, almost like a distant thought process. Gone Girl also has a brilliantly written and adapted script that does a great job balancing dark humour- that's not overused and is often hilarious- and suspense mystery (The Cool Girl monologue in particular is a masterpiece of script-writing, one of my favourite film monologues ever), while the story(apart from taking a bit of time to get starting) is absorbing from start to finish, rich in detail and characterisation and is filled with shocks and unpredictable twists that will be guaranteed to leave you reeling. That it is adapted from superb source material(one of the best books I've read in recent memory actually) helps it, and that it is faithful to it is commendable, a case of being faithful to the source material actually coming off wonders rather than being bogged down by being too faithful. The not-what-they-seem characters are incredibly interesting and richly developed, especially Amy who is one of the most chilling female characters of the year. And the acting is one of the high points of the film, as good as Fincher's direction and the score are it's Rosamund Pike's knockout turn as Amy in restrained- she only has to raise an eyebrow or something like that and it says a lot- but quite terrifying mode(especially in the third act) that makes the film. It will be a great surprise if she isn't at least nominated because it is easily her best performance. Ben Affleck has the other not-what-they-seem role and plays it with oozing charm and brooding intensity, while Neil Patrick Harris surprisingly excels in a very against-type role(who knew he could be sinister?) and Tyler Perry oozes charisma and is very funny. Carrie Coon is the standout in support, it's a tricky role and the moral compass of the film but Coon is touchingly likable in it. The ending does for my liking end too suddenly and the storytelling got implausible and lazy at this point, but apart from that Gone Girl was a winner and one of the best of the year. 9/10 Bethany CoxStarted great, middle OK...then bombs. OK, so I saw this film tonight at my local cinema and was hopeful the movie would live up to the hype I had been reading. Yes I have heard that the book is great although can't be bothered with reading it. Anyway the film starts slowly where Affleck's wife goes missing and we follow the manhunt and the media frenzy as BA tries to put the puzzles together about his wife whereabouts, with his twin sister. Evidence start to stack up against Affleck as does peoples opinion. I won't spoil it for anyone but the plot didn't disappoint and the film is quite enjoyable for the most part.  Direction, acting, music and storyline blend well together to reward the film-goer. But here is where the film disappointed me or rather the storyline. For the last 15 minutes of the film I could not believe what was happening. It was as the author had given up on the last pages his book on how to come up with a great ending and goes for some unbelievable long-shot, hope it will stick conclusion. The story was so captivating and believable that I could see Fincher on the red carpet with the Oscar, but the ending killed the movie for me. When all is said is done, could have been thriller of the year(IMO) but came up short.Can't get behind Gone Girl (SPOILERS) First of all, let me say, I am fan of David Fincher. I like his films a lot. But I cannot get behind Gone Girl.  No, I have not read the book, and I don't care. Movies are free-standing, and it is not their job to be an addendum or a companion to the source material. The film should work on its own. If it doesn't, it only has its makers to blame.  This film has a too many flaws to ignore.  First, the beginning setup back story was pretty bad. I understand all the flashback stuff of Nick and Amy when they first met and started dating is important to the story. I am just saying that it was bad. Some of the dialog was so stupid, I wanted to laugh out loud in the theater. If the dialog was taken verbatim from the book, well, its the director's job to see that in film form it doesn't work. And for me, it did NOT work. It was just so contrived and unbelievable as to be ¬Ö well ¬Ö dumb. That is the only word for it - dumb. And this back story, in the form of flashbacks, litters the first third of the film.  But the film finally starts gaining steam, overcoming the cookie-cutter mundanity of the first act. Amy's framing of Nick is being revealed. Nick is now being looked at hard by the police. The physical evidence is starting to pile up. Yet they still have no body to charge him with murder. Nick must run to a fancy lawyer. He is being slayed in the media. Perhaps that is the strongest part of this film ¬Ö how the public is so impressionable and so deceived by the media. Most people will believe almost anything they are told on TV or read on the Internet and become overly emotionally involved. It's pretty disgusting. We obviously have seen that numerous times in the past 5 years or so.  So, it's inevitable ¬Ö at some point Amy is going to be found alive or she is going to come home. You just know that is coming. And come home she does, after murdering poor Desi Collings and framing him for her abduction.  So you think the movie is going to end soon. Nope. What we are lead to believe is building up to some awesome, climactic ending slowly drips to disappointing dud. And no, I don't care if this was how the book was written, and when you read the book, "it's awesome." This is a film, and it has to work on it's own, as a film. To me, it didn't.  Look, I don't mind unresolved, unconventional endings. I am fan of art films, so this is not some plebeian movie-goer here complaining about how the ending "sucked bad, bro." But it just didn't work in this case. It was not THAT type of film for the entire runtime. You can't just tack on some awkward ending and accept the audience to accept it, when the rest of the film was trying to be something else. To be blunt, the ending was just awful. If Gone Girl was not based on a book, I would have assumed that they didn't know how to end it in the writing process, so they just tacked on some awful ending that was thought up in a production meeting or something like that. It was that level of bad.  And speaking of awkward. The score just didn't work for me. It seemed like Fincher once again teamed up with Reznor and Ross because he uses him on all his films now. The score was good on it's own, but it seemed out of place in this piece to me. It made the whole thing, cinematography included, seemed forced and out of place.  Affleck was okay. The best acting in the film came from the female cop, the twin sister, and of course Rosamund Pike, who played her character to perfection, even if a lot of her dialog was contrived and unnecessary.  Anyway, I am sure a lot of people will disagree, but but that is how I see it.Marriage-A Undying Loving Relationship Or A Sin Of Knowing a Person So Well My Review For Gone girl Is marriage is such a complicated thing? We all know it has its ups and downs can marriage can be dangerous too? How well a person can understand the other person in just 5 years of there relationship ?. All this question rush through my mind when I left the theater with a heaviness in my heart. I read the book Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn 1 month ago it was such a great experience of exploring such dynamic characters and Gillian Flynn does it so well that the story gets deeper and deeper in to the horrors of marriage. The movie starts off great with the line which is also the starting line of the novel an if look at it carefully you will understand that the movie completely justifies the novel except the movie doesn't go deep in to amazing Amy fantasies story books as they have written in the book. David Fincher nails it again,the atmosphere of all the scene and the lighting effect are just as perfect as they gets when you read the novel this movie gives you a remainder of Hitchcock classics suspense movies. Ben Affleck was amazing, cool guy the kind of character who keep all his fears secrets inside his stomach and doesn't give you a slightest of the hint when you look at his face and Hats Off to Rosamund Pike the greatest on screen performance of the year she truly deserves an Oscar Noam and Margo played by Carrie coon was too perfect and all the other characters was also great. The ending of the movie will be a part of the discussion because I can say that the people who haven't read the book are the people who will not like the ending. The message you get is like marriage is like a cigarette you know from the start that the thing is going to kill you someday but you couldn't leave that because that is the only thing that you need when you are alone or under stress so its an undying relationship. So go rush to the theater and this movie will make you dayOh, yeah, she's gone; brilliant, engrossing movie Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) lives in the small, riverside Missouri town that he grew up in. It hasn't always been so. For a number of years, Nicky worked in Manhattan as a journalist, where he met his brilliant wife, Amy (Rosamunde Pike). Also a writer, Amy grew up in the area, with two somewhat famous author-parents, who concocted a young lady's series of books called Amazing Amy. But, the economy took a nosedive and both young marrieds lost their jobs. At the same time, Nick's mother got breast cancer so the couple decided to move back to the Show Me State. Nick opens a bar with some of Amy's trust fund while Amy ponders her next move. One morning, alas, Nick is called home by a neighbor, who has seen his cat outside. When he arrives home, Nick sees signs of a possible break-in at their abode and Amy is missing. That's right, she's gone, girl. Meanwhile, there are scenes of Amy writing a diary, telling the details of how they met and how blissful early married life seemed. She also notes that the Missouri move has troubled her. But, now, she's missing. The police have few clues but believe a media event to ask for the city's help in finding her would be the best way to go. Reluctantly, Nick calls his in-laws and they rush to town, where they make a televised appeal for Amy's safe return. All too soon, Nick is attacked as "not sorry enough" and is fingered as the likely individual responsible for his wife's disappearance. The only person in Nick's corner at the moment is his twin, Margo, who co-owns the bar. With an increasing media frenzy, Nick is in the hot seat. But, there's more. There are secrets by the dozens to be uncovered, some for Nick and some big ones for Amy. What appears to be a kidnapping may be something else. Will she be coming home? Will Nick be sent to the slammer? This brilliant, engrossing thriller cannot be talked about in detail; otherwise, the twists are revealed. Let's just say "what lies beneath" may not be pretty. The cast is stunning, with Affleck and Pike doing grand work while Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry, Kim Dickens, and all of the others are fantastic, too. The watery setting is likewise intriguing. But, its the story, script, and direction that towers above everything else. Gillian Flynn, who wrote the novel, has fashioned a script that mirrors the book and is quite wonderful. As for the direction, David Fincher (with great editing, too) keeps the relentless pace and mystery in every moment. Equally good is his camera shots, opting to fade in and out with visual power. So, add it up and the sum is one fantastic flick indeed. As Mikey said long ago, oh yeah, she's gone and viewers wouldn't want it any other way.Best movie of the year Do you agree?  My review:  For the most part, critics have been good with their ratings this year with a few exceptions. However, this is not one of those cases. I don't get the critics sometimes. Giving ridiculous movies like Maze Runner, Lucy, etc., good reviews is mortally wrong. They gave this a 59%, barely rotten, but should be higher. It's not Antoine's best work but it surely dishes out a blood justice good time. It's bloody, violet, meaningful (whatever rotten), and shouldn't br taken too seriously. This isn't as masterpiece or Denzel's best work, but it's clearly should be fresh. If you're going into this movie thinking it's going to be nothing but a fun movie, then you're setting yourself up for a bad time. It has its smart moments, but it's basicaly the rated R version of taken, which I loved. Overall I loved this movie, not for the smart and master piece of a movie, but for the violet and action packed movie. 8.5/10Gone Man: Hijacked by his Co Dependency After having both read the book and seen the film I was struck with one theme. Gone Man: Hijacked by his co dependency and addiction (alcohol) Ben Afflect was well cast as the perfect gone man who is also known as Nick.  The final scene leaves Nick so cut off from himself that he goes into a hypnotic trance to keep his wife's crime of murder a secret. Does Nick know what it feels like to walk in the perpetrator's shoes? Will he know what it feels like to walk in the perpetrator's shoes. The ending leaves the audience all hanging. Very well written directed acted and produced! Cathy SargentUnforgettable Fun Gone Girl is a tour de force of modern cinema. It combines that best of both worlds; those worlds being 90s Fincher and 2000s Fincher. It has the intricate, multi-perspective narrative of The Social Network, the interplay of media and crime reminiscent of Zodiac, the playful surrealism of The Game, the brash blood and gore of Se7en. And of course, like Fight Club, it had that indefatigable story, twisting and turning at every point imaginable, and taking the audience on an unforgettable cinematic experience. It was particularly joyful to see such well written female characters, the centerpiece being Amy Dunne played by the Hollywood newcomer Rosamund Pike. Like an amoral Lisabeth Salander, Amy presents a terrifying image of female vengeance. It was good to see a filmmaker known for his sausagefest films expand to include a more balanced cast where women aren't reduced to sexual objects (I'm looking at you, The Social Network). I hope this marks a new era of Fincher, one which balances intelligent, sophisticated filmmaking with loads and loads of dark, twisted fun. 10/10The best i saw this year I was saving a movie to give a score 10 this year. And, despite the script failures (normal in movies), I must confess that in itself comes to interpretation and idea for a long, this movie was the one that caught my attention. In some moments you can be easily putting yourself in the main character shoes. Holes will exist in almost every film, and who have not seen it yet, will notice this a few in this movie, as well as some very surreal situations .. For me, normal, when you do not want to tell a very boring story. Ben Affleck was remarkable and Rosamund Pike, for the first time in her carrier (personal opinion), act with paper and salt and not like.. tasteless. Very worth checking out this movie."When two people love each other and can't make that work, that's the real tragedy" One thing I can count on from David Fincher - he's consistent. Consistently great - as a director. From Fight Club to Social Network, no one can quite mix social commentary with a streak of dark humor quite like Fincher. And somehow, he can keep you on the edge of your seat - even if you know the outcome. With Gone Girl, he has done it again, and, if you haven't read the book by Gillian Flynn, do yourself a favor and don't spoil this one - because it's worth it to go into it with as little knowledge as possible. I will try to be as spoiler free as possible in this review. We start off with Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) heading out for the day to hang out at The Bar (yes - wickedly original name) that he owns with his sister, Margo (Carrie Coon). It seems like today, the fifth anniversary to his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) he would rather forget. Seems things are a bit rocky at the Dunne household and even since moving from New York to Missouri to care for his (now-deceased) ailing mother, the relationship has soured a bit from the heady, happy days when they were both employed and hadn't fallen into such a rut. Things go from bad to worse when Nick returns home to find his door open, Amy gone and a broken table. Enter Detective Rhonda Boney (Amy Dickens) a by-the-books cop who wastes no time in ascertaining the situation. Nick is fully cooperative, even as things start to shine a light on him. Soon enough he is hounded by the media non-stop, finds Amy's parents (David Clennon and Lisa Banes) turning against him - along with public sentiment, as secrets are uncovered and he learns some disturbing information about his wife's past. Needless to say, there is a much deeper plot afoot - one long in the making that will have lasting implications on the lives of the people involved. Gone Girl isn't just about the characters, even though they are greet. Affleck stated that he studied many real life crime cases to play the role of Nick Dunne - especially Scott Peterson - and he nails the part. And Pike is even better as Amy - just when you think you know her character, the film throws in a completely new angle and, needless to say, it gets better with every twist. But the supporting characters are great - even Tyler Perry, a man I thought would forever be ingrained in my mind as "that dude who dresses up to play Madea" is good in his role as a hotshot lawyer known for defending husbands in trouble. Look for Missi Pyle as dead ringer for witch hunt queen Nancy Grace as well as Sela Ward as a top network interviewer (ala Diane Sawyer). The media plays just a big a role in this film as the characters - and that is where Fincher takes his social commentary. I know - I watch CNN every morning and if there is one thing the media is great at - is jumping the gun. How many times has a person gone from victim to villain or vice versa? Remember how we treated the "Olympic bomber" Richard Jewell? If not - his case is a prime example of how quickly a life can be ruined by media speculation. The media here is always present - TVs are always on in the background - a smile and a selfie become damning evidence and talking heads and online comments spiral out of control. It is fascination and disquieting just how effective the film is at portraying the media. Aside from that, the story is riveting, although you are sure to see some of the twists in advance, watching how it plays out is a great way to spend the time. The ending may be a bit abrupt, but essentially if gives you an open-ended way to end the story - in your mind, and it can play out in so many different ways. The movie is long, but it moves at a brisk pace. There isn't much outright humor (aside from a few well-placed lines) but the underlying tone is there, dark as it might be. Gone Girl is one of the better movies of the year, and once again I have Fincher to thank.Great thriller with Good Acting Seeing this movie twice I will admit that this movie does contain plot holes but overall it is still a highly enjoyable thriller with what I believe is some top notch acting. Both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are great in their roles and both Oscar worthy, even Tyler Perry does a surprisingly great job in his role. The score is a highlight worth mentioning in this review because it is amazing Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross did a superb job the soundtrack is amazing and should win an Oscar because it is hauntingly powerful. I recommend this movie for anyone willing to have a good time trying to witness a good thriller and great acting.Crazy. Best movie I've seen in a while. Deserves to be in IMDb Top 50 list. This movie had really great writing. Was anyone surprised with the amount of dark humor in the movie. Not only was it dark and twisted, but it was hilarious! Very smart and witty writing. I've seen it two and a half times in theaters already. The novel is even better. Flynn wrote the screenplay so she was able to get the right tone and dialog, but there's just more room for it in a novel. I never really considered myself much of an Affleck fan before, but after Gone Girl I'd say that from now on I'll be seeing whatever he puts out. I liked The Town and Argo, and will admit he's a suitable director, but his acting wasn't anything special to me. But to me Gone Girl was an INCREDIBLE example of Affleck's acting and how he really is on a hot streak. So glad Fincher got him to do this, he's the perfect guy for the role, and if you haven't seen it yet, pleas go see it. I was also blown away by Rosamund Pike. I've admired her work for a while (she was one of the best things about Die Another Day IMO) but Gone Girl was something truly special. People are murmuring about Oscar buzz for her but at the very least I think this film will catapult her to the so-called A list. Upon my second viewing, it became abundantly clear that Gone Girl was a perverse Romantic Comedy, albeit a Dark Comedy. The kind of comedy only Fincher would have the cunning to pull off with a straight face. It plays like anything but upon the surface, but like Amy and Nick Dunne, there's plenty more than meets the eye.Fincher at his finest I had not heard about "Gone Girl" before September 2014. I discovered it when I decided to check David Fincher's filmography one day. "A new Fincher movie!? Awesome!" were the thoughts that flew through me. Unfortunately I didn't get to see it in theatres, but I did get to see it after a while. The story is dark and superbly crafted. It is rare to find a story with such a simple premise yet such a complex execution. You'll second guess yourself every scene to what is going on yet you will always be wrong. The acting is also really great with Affleck and Pike giving truly great performances. And yes, I had no problem with Tyler Perry. The score by Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross was great as always. And of course, the direction by David Fincher is superb. It is rare to find a director as great as him working today.  Overall this movie is great and should not be missed. But be warned, this movie is quite disturbing.It Must Be Cold in Hell David Fincher knows how to pick his choices for movies. He's gone from the nightmarish but brilliant "Se7en", the puzzling "The Game", and list goes on and on, but nothing will prepare you for the sharp portrayal by Rosalind Pike of the fantastic character that is the heart of "Gone Girl". Throughout the film, she shines, radiating this cool, cold beauty, matched only by the cold design of her intellect and the execution of the movie. At first, I thought having Affleck play her counterpart was one humongous mistake, but it actually works well because Affleck's range gives him enough room for us not believe that he can never be a match for her. It's obvious from the beginning that he is nothing else but another step on her way to something much bigger and better. Yes, there are a few seconds when we think it is possible to up her game, but if that were to happen, it would feel like cheating. It's nature game that it's the survival of the fittest, and if he is to make it, it's not going to be her choice. In fact, I think it's pretty courageous of Fincher that the film ends the way it does. Everyone involved in the film is fantastic since they're not afraid to show their flaws, their doubts, the fact that it's after all, a cold and unsympathetic world. We never root for anyone because we're surrounded by vultures, ready to prey on the leftover of the other vultures. Children are nowhere to be seen, except for a couple of shots where they hurriedly leave the scene. If anything, they are weapons to trap and destroy your opponent or worse, they're to be used in order achieve bigger goals. A man soon becomes the presumed guilty party in the disappearance of his wife, a woman who is seen by many as a stranger and difference creature. She is after all, from New York, and this is a small town where affairs happen, but murder is just something else. The rope gets tighter and tighter, and we have no other expectations that the mystery will be solved and Affleck will get his due. Before the deal is done, the first of the unexpected turns happens, and designs change because of fate. Here is where everything we think is coming takes a completely different spin, but the tone and the mood remains. This is where the cool beauty of Pike gives way to her cool mind, and things become uglier as we discover what is really going, and how she is one of the most resourceful people here. It becomes clear that it would take a miracle to upset the natural order of things, and the realization is not how it will end, just bad the ending will be. I overheard some people walking out of the theater expressing disappointment, but that only made me realize, how well the resolution is executed because this is after a work of art that has taken plenty of chances both in its written source and the translation to the cinema. Unlike "Tattoo" where emotional involvement went subzero in its American adaptation, this one maintains its rotten heart beating quite strongly. There is not much affection or happiness involved. This is not a movie about love, but a movie about how dark human nature can be. There is very little bloodshed because even the big scene is meticulously executed, almost begging to be admired rather than for shocking purposes. Sharon Stone's character in "Basic Instinct" would be a mere apprentice if she hanged around the characters in this movie. Behind the camera and in absolute control is Fincher who manages to give Missouri and the Mississippi a cold, gray and steely look and feel that has probably not been seen before. It's an incisive look at how humans really behave when the fantasies of love go away for whatever reason that might be.One of those can't even get up to go to the bathroom kind of movies... Brilliant absolutely brilliant. From start to finish this was an all around great movie and is pretty much the film I'm always looking to find. Every twist and turn was completely unexpected which can be pretty rare in a drama/thriller...If your reading these reviews most likely you want to watch or already have and if your in the category of "wanting to watch" DO IT!! You will not regret it!I really didn't think I would even enjoy this for some odd reason but after the first ten minutes that changed and for me to be able to say that that's a total plus in my book. p.s. for all the lovely ladies Ben Affleck and Tyler Perry are some serious eye candy to boot. Enjoy.Flawless Art Whenever a novel is being turned into a film, I am always extremely skeptical. Most of the time, an adaptation of a book so widely loved is made purely for the fans, and all it does is serve justice to the people who were losing their mind over this book over the past couple of years. But now that I have seen Gone Girl, I can now understand why people were going crazy. This story and the way its is filmed is undoubtedly the best we have had all year, and quite possibly the best adapted film ever made. Having not read the book, I was completely shocked when it was revealed that Amy was still alive and it was she who staged the entire crime scene. It is the twists such as these that had me wanting more of Gone Girl, cringing and impatiently waiting to see what the next oblique turn it will take. I have never been so shocked, disgusted, and overall emotionally invested in a film as much as I was with Gone Girl. As I have been staying, the story and screenplay are flawless. But what really steals the show of the film is the presentation. Ben Affleck gives the performance of his career in his character which is sometimes despicable, sometimes empathetic. However, it is Rosamund Pike who acts as the stand out role. From being a scared vulnerable housewife to a manipulative murderous psycho, Pike delves deep into the persona of the Amazing Amy and mesmerizes in every sense of the way through very word she speaks and every move she makes. I will be shocked if both of them do not receive an Oscar nod, and even more so is Pike does not take home the gold. But what really is the most impressive aspect of this film to me is the work done by the great David Fincher. Every shot in the film is so meticulously crafted and cared for that sets up the dark mysterious tone of the film. The cinematography gives an overall dreadful atmosphere which sets you on edge, leading to the climax of the film. You guessed it, the part in which Amy kills NPH's character. This scene may be one of the most expertly staged shot I have ever seen, it sneaks up on you out of no where and it made my jaw drop. I will never get the image of Amy stabbing him out of no where and bathing in his blood out of my head.  There is no higher praise I could give this film. The statements it has on the media and marriage are so unique, and make your evaluate the success of our century. A movie has never made me think so much about how much I know the people I love. And with the presentation and acting of the film, it all adds up to be a flawless piece of cinema history. Grade: A+ / 100What a flawless film. The best part about Gone Girl is that the plot is so immersive, it can make you easily forget about the subtle details that add to this masterpiece. I had to go see the film twice just to appreciate these details put there by David Fincher. That, and simply because I loved the film. Gone girl represents the hardship of any relationship; to the extreme. Nick's undoubtable feeling of being not good enough for his wife is something a lot of men can relate to, whilst Amy's feelings of isolation can be easily be related to by a lot of women. No doubt, Rosamund Pikes stellar performance also helps to bring these hardcore feelings to life. Ben Affleck also played a major part in this with his believable portrayal of Nick Dunn. You can also peel back these marital themes and see the other side of Gone Girl as well. The idea of anchorage in the media, no doubt, plays a major role in the film, with Ellen Abott representing Nick as a horrible, pathetic excuse for a man, and also employing the idea that Nick had incestual relations with his sister. Both of which were not true, but made selling the story to viewers easier. Fincher also puts in subtle instances of foreshadowing. When Nick is at his dads house, he say's something along the lines of 'I'm just checking the place hasn't burned down'. Later in the film we find out that Nick's dads house was where Amy had burnt her diary. Furthermore, when Desi is driving up to his house with Amy in the car, there's a quick shot of his front door that seems out of place, this is to highlight the fact that the front door holds significance in Amy's staged rape (Desi walks out the front door after Amy messes up his hair and clothes) and to, understandably, foreshadow this scene. I would recommend Gone Girl to anyone, I believe it's easy to resonate with the characters, the plot is incredible and the entertainment value of the film is second to none. Kudos David Fincher.Thrill for the whole time of the movie Definitely the movie to watch! I saw it by accident because was no really other movies to see in the moment, but me and my friend already decided to have a movie night. So happy we did this choice! I watched the trailer before and wasn't expecting anything exciting because thought all story have been told already. And wow, I was totally mistaking! The story line was going so unexpected that I was afraid to miss even a second of the movie! Actions taking place in there were so intense that kept me thrilled for the whole time of the session. One of the best movies I've seen so far. Rosamund Pike does phenomenal play in there! And David Fincher is totally genius!Gone girl This movie sucked. Horrible plot... What a waste of my time!!! The investigation did not carry through in so many different areas. Why didn't they interview the creep? He shows up at the support rally knowing he once had a restraining order but they didn't see it as anything suspicious?? What about that amount of blood they found on the floor and she comes back with minor bruises? The movie left holes left right and centre! Ugh what a disappointment. There was a little twist but it carried out WAYYYYY too long.. Like two hours too long. Why on earth was this nominated for best picture? Why has it been rated 8/10?! Are people actually getting stupid? I actually created an account just to rate this stupid movie.Overrated nonsensical melodrama This movie was on TV this evening and I decided to watch it partly because it has a reputation as a decent film, and partly because there was a joke that referenced it on "You're The Worst" this season and I wanted to get the backstory. Since it was on regular TV, it was obvious that some bits had been cut out and some dialog had been changed to get around the R rating, but I'm pretty sure I got the gist of it. And it baffles me that anyone thought this was a great movie. Others have done a great job of pointing out all the plot holes here on IMDb (as I did to my wife while watching it), but not many have mentioned how over-the-top melodramatic the story and acting were (as my wife did to me several times while watching it), to the point of near self-parody. Speaking of the plot holes (SPOILER ALERT), I'll just mention that my favorite is that the wife is DRENCHED in blood after killing her "alibi", drives all the way home that way (without calling for help), is taken to the hospital, examined by doctors, sedated, questioned by the FBI and police and taken home again...and is STILL drenched in blood, finally showering it off at home what must have been hours later. What the heck? How was that supposed to be even remotely believable? But maybe, just maybe, despite all that I could have found it in my heart to give this a 5 or 6 rating (after all, it did help kill three hours of an otherwise dull evening), IF IT HAD HAD SOME KIND OF ENDING. Seriously, I was really curious about how they were going to resolve this whole thing - I expected either the husband to kill the wife or vice versa, but nope. Affleck's character decides to just live fearfully and suspiciously ever after with his psycho wife, roll credits. Wow, what an anticlimax. The movie probably still deserves a 3 or 4, but I'm going with 1 just to try to bring its ridiculous 8.4 average down a bit.Boring, Ridiculous and Shallow I read the book and absolutely despised it, mostly for its cookie-cutter characters and the bizarre overuse of sexual dialogue coupled with an incredulous mystery that was more silly than engaging. I was hoping maybe the film would be a bit of an improvement but nope, not a bit. If anything the film is worse. Too many long, dull and badly-lit shots, too many stupid and weird lines ("cool girl presents her mouth for f*cking and shaves her p*ssy", what the hell?? Now there's one quote that you won't see up there on the 100 Best Quotes Times Magazine List!), too many characters who you wanted to strangle, from the psychopathic yet pathetic wife to the whiny busybody nerd friend. A serious lack of imagination and a serious injection of pretentiousness that just comes across as very annoying more than stylish. Somehow this waste of Kodachrome (or whatever film stock they used for it) has an 8.1/10 rating, higher than masterpieces like "The Killing Fields" (1984) and "Christine" (2016)? How on earth did that happen? Is the review system rigged? If not completely horrible, Gone Girl is at best terribly overrated. I was not a fan of most of the actors' jobs in this although I think they were just trying to work with whatever material there was. The soundtrack is totally unmemorable and boringly flat, as flat as the characters and scenery. Gone Girl could have been something better than this, but it tried too hard to be profound and ended up just coming off as shallow, petty and pointless.Nothing connects Affleck plays Nick Dunne whose wife goes missing. When treasure hunt-like envelopes with 'clue x' written on it appear, the viewer knows the disappearing was staged. Oddly enough, the movie then continues as like the viewer doesn't know this. It makes no sense. Gone Girl is Fincher's weakest effort to date. Nothing in the film connects to that which was intended to be displayed. The actors don't fit the characters, much like the synthetic dialog, and way too many scenes lack the proper build-up, feeling like they belonged in a completely different movie. Every character in the film comes across as a one-dimensional product of someone's limited imagination rather than an actual person. Yet the sloppy way the implausible, immature storyline is sold as credible, is surely the movie's biggest flaw. Our hearts go out to the family members of Suspension of Disbelief. May it rest in peace. The scenario would perhaps fit a Coen brother's movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and where the absurdity can be put to use as a form of comedy. As it stands, the lacking source material just contrasts too much with Fincher's superior directional skills and cinematographic wizardry, not to mention Reznor's outstanding soundtrack. It's all just one gigantic mismatch. 1/10
A Thrilling Sequel that Raises the Bar for Marvel With Rogers, Fury, and Romanoff previously established, directors Joe and Anthony Russo do a magnificent job at expanding these characters ‚Äì along with some secondary characters we've seen before ‚Äì providing more depth to understanding their actions and how they will affect future stories. Sam Jackson has a stronger presence this time around, validating Nick Fury as a main staple in the MCU among the big boys. Captain America is stronger, faster, and a more refined soldier, equipped with better fighting skills and understanding of current technology. Evans plays the earnestness of Captain America's black and white morality with convincing finesse in an age of grey that he has yet to find a comfortable middle. And Johansson progresses the allure of the cunning and multifaceted Black Widow, while bringing a splendid and lively balance to Rogers' straight and narrow. Amidst such a tight and clever script, The Winter Soldier introduces a band of new characters, all of whom play a significant role, creating a more layered and conceivably real MCU. Frank Grillo brings the swolling mass of muscle known as S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Brock Rumlow to life. Emily VanCamp surprises with her portrayal of Agent 13, whom I wish had more screen time with Cap than just two quick scenes. Robert Redford plays Alexander Pierce, a superior ranking Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., friend to Nick Fury, and representative of the World Security Council. Pierce is a wonderful look into the higher ranks at S.H.I.E.L.D., contributing new insights as to how the organization is run outside of Fury, Agent Coulson, and Agent Maria Hill. Anthony Mackie is Sam Wilson aka The Falcon, an ex-military special-ops paratrooper and a welcomed addition recruited by Rogers to help fight the good fight. Mackie fits comfortably among the cast of veteran actors and should play nicely with the other Avengers. Enhanced for combat and strength, The Winter Soldier's presence is terrifying when it comes to any action scene. Sebastian Stan does an amazing job holding his own against his targets and those who get in his way of his missions. My only gripe is that it is not explained how he obtains the immense power and skills he beholds. The connection between Rogers and The Winter Soldier is dealt with true care and excels the story of Captain America from the first film brilliantly. (Be sure to stay after the credits for a nice button leading into Captain America 3.)  The Winter Soldier is not just a fantastic sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers, it should also be recognized as one of the best sequels ever made. In fact, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the duo behind Thor: The Dark World, the Narnia Trilogy, and The First Avenger, have done such a great job shaping Captain America's story that this movie could almost stand on its own. There are many exciting twists and turns in this well-constructed, political action-thriller, but nothing comes as more of a shock than how important the story is at defining the direction of the MCU. What takes place in The Winter Soldier, along with an awesome mid-credits sequence tie-in, will inherently influence Avengers: Age of Ultron as well as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. ‚Äì which should make the TV series a lot more interesting and reward fans who have stuck by its side. Tonally, The Winter Soldier is the darkest story we've come to encounter, raising many deep-seated questions about government and soldiers of war while also taking Rogers on an emotional journey. It also has the best action choreography among all of the MCU movies thus far. Whedon's NYC battle in The Avengers is beautifully shot and written, but cannot compare to the hard-hitting set pieces found in The Winter Soldier, each building up to the bigger whole. The Russo brothers come from a background of directing television comedies such as Arrested Development and Community, and it's extraordinary how well they handle a big budget action blockbuster from cinematography to pacing. They do infuse their own style of comedy with fun references and a cameo other than Stan Lee, functioning properly within the confines of the tone and story. Henry Jackman (Captain Phillips; Wreck-It Ralph; X-Men: First Class) also composes an adrenaline pumping score that sets the right mood every time. The biggest fault found in The Winter Soldier is that it does not address the whereabouts of other heroes or where we are in terms of the time line of the other movies. Why can't Captain America call on Tony Stark to help him out or even Hawkeye who is a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. himself. This is a recurring problem we have seen throughout Phase 2 of the MCU in Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. Marvel Studios needs to acknowledge this hiccup if they want us to continue to believe all of these characters live in the same universe together. You cannot exclude these characters once you have opened Pandora's Box. Marvel Studios has hit this one out of the ball park with yet another gripping adaptation for fans to enjoy for years to come. By and large, Captain America: The Winter Soldier succeeds on all fronts. It is the perfect set up for future films and at the same time it increases the value of its predecessors. There is little to argue against its merits and should be regarded as one of the greatest superhero movies of all time.A wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great great film This film is simply exceptional in every way. The edge it has is delivering the best, grittiest action the genre has ever scene and characters that are as complex as the are fun. Why do I say that? Well... What I love about the character is that Steve Rogers has "I'm-a-man-out- of-time issues" but he's comfortable with the chaos that it brings. In acclimating himself to this century he is at his best. Yes, most people would be overwhelmed but because of who he is and where he's from, he's able to cope and adapt. The serum that gives him his physical edge also gives him a mental boost. It's his emotions that are raw and unaided. Time has passed since Avengers so we don't get to see his day to day amazement and adjustment. I'm glad they skipped that stuff. What we do see is the man who once represented America and has become alien to America and it's slanted values. The passage of time. Add those struggles to a full blown conspiracy film and what results might just be the best film released all year long. Steve Rogers is basically a John Wayne American. The world shifts to him and it's his job to tell everybody "Here's they way things should be done." We saw that in Avengers and even the first film after he gathered his Howling Commandos. Now, the powers that be are a lot more flexible in terms of loyalties and how they're going to get certain jobs done. How he handles this century's gray morality is at the heart of the film. Like most men from the 1940's, Steve keeps things to himself and keeps his emotions bottled up. (EX: the first film when he mentions his mother dying of TB and he was even embarrassed when Peggy found him mourning alone for Bucky) So, bringing The Black Widow in to this film gives him someone who is going to draw out his story, because he's never going to offer it up of his own accord. Natasha learns from him. Fury learns from him. Sam Wilson learns from him. Yet, they all give him something in return. Every character used is utilized perfectly and smartly. Falcon for example, is not in awe of the legend of Captain America. This is exactly what Steve wants in a friend and in a fellow soldier, to not have to be Captain America. Everyone fits perfectly in to the plot and allows access to different beats, tones and emotional depth. Yes, conspiracy thrillers need depth and this one has it. Captain America is probably the only superhero left in this world of the reboot who is singularly heroic. He doesn't have this dark existential quandary like other reinventions. Plugging that resolute goodness into a morally complex story means he doesn't question what he believes, but he questions whether anybody else does anymore. He doesn't question his foundation but he questions where he has ended up and what his role must now be. The conspiracy element and structure of this story helps in that Captain America is not up on a pedestal being self righteous, he's in a corner and that makes you want to root for the guy. He believes in what he's doing and the viewer is along for a great ride sharing that belief. Marvel movies usually establish character early. This one starts out fast but it's got a lot of character in it. The first act packs a punch but does it laying the groundwork for a remarkable third act. They take time showing the issues and you immediately empathize with Steve. Giving us good character depth means the action delivers more punch. And the action here is beyond great. This movie absolutely punches you in the face in the best way possible. The action has advanced a lot from the first film. How he now operates in the world and kicks butt is all very impressive. So, this is probably Marvel's grittiest movie and it's also their best sequel to date. There's a dash of humor but there's mostly a wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great great film.Pure Awesomeness Went into the movie not expecting much as I felt that the first Captain America was one of the weaker movies in Phase one of the Avengers. However, this movie was one of the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. First off, the action and fight scenes in the movie are just awesome and there is plenty of action to keep you entertained throughout the entire movie. There is also enough humour to balance all this. The characters all had their own amazing moments and the acting is decent as well. You get to see more of Nick Fury, and he was awesome in this. Black Widow is used much more in this movie and as well as being badass, she brings out more of the Captain's story. Sam Wilson (the Falcon) is great and is involved in some great action scenes. The villains in this movie were awesome as well. Quite enjoyed the story as well. There were a few twists; some unexpected, some expected. And the reveal of the unexpected twists in the final third were epic. The story is not just about Captain America and the Winter Soldier, there are darker forces at play and causes the Captain to ask dangerous questions. This movie is very entertaining, the story is decent, the ending is awesome and satisfying and I would recommend watching this. Makes for a decent political thriller as well. This will easily be one of my favourite movies.Brilliant film! Now "The winter soldier" is everything a Captain America movie should be. While it maintains some of the humour that now has become the trademark of Marvel films, TWS is way more serious than all of them combined. And this is truly where the film feels so brave and yes different than any other superhero flicks that we have seen.  Which brings me to the most important point, the plot. While of course it is not going to be the most original or complicated film of the century, there is the basic screen writing elements that so much lack from modern day blockbusters. You have the (likable) characters and a mystery they need to solve along with a racing clock. It reminded me the 70's political paranoia thrillers (3 days of the Condor - another Redford link, The parallax view, Z) and it is a welcome tone that makes the WS to differentiate itself from the rest. There are strong scenes regarding political fear, control, and information manipulation but it never feels bloated or overbearing. the purpose is to entertain even if it manages to squeeze through a bit of political views with Rogers replacing the viewer's voice on screen. At one point there is a talk about who is who which results in every man for himself mayhem in one of the most interesting sequences that you may see this year. We do not get this stuff these days! Besides the charged plot, the introduction of new characters and the mega mayhem in the streets of Washingthon DC, the Russos have found time (and they should bloody do since TWS is 2 and a half hours long!) to inject some sentiments in the proceedings - a visit to Peggy, a confrontation with Fury regarding SHIELDs actions, Bucky's memory recall, Natasha's kissing talk. They could have easily skip these "crap" but instead the extra running time feels adjusted and coherent with a bit of more characterization which results to bring us closer to the on screen counterparts.  However, the action is what took me by surprise. The bar has been set higher now. It is truly unbelievable to think that these two directors (of the "Community" fame) came with such inventive ways of using Cap's shield. Finally, the shield gets to be seen in all of its glory. In addition, all the fist fights (and they are many) are excellent examples and putting the glasses to the school of frantic edit (which I truly despise) with varied and rapid choreography. A terrific elevator fight sequence probably stands out as truly memorable whereas the encounters with the Winter Soldier never feel repetitive. The Russo brothers keep changing the game from stealth and cloak missions, to car chases, to gun fires, to dog fights, to fist fights. There is something for everyone here and it is arguably among the finest I have seen. Impressive considering their credits. Real stunt work (backflips, wrestle moves, somersaults, etc), real fights and it is a pleasing sight to go away from superhero duels of the Avengers, Thor and Iron man. These characters rely on instincts and bullets. No more and no less and most of them do have some brutal moments for a PG-13 film (and blood too). The actors are absolutely brilliant in their roles. While Evans came out as a bit arrogant in the "Avengers" and the least interesting character, here he truly shines. First time ever, I actually bought what he was bringing on the table. This is a soldier who believed in protecting the people and their freedom. Here though, in the modern era of espionage with multiple intrigues and political events, he finds himself unable to identify which side he is on and for what. At one point he even considers himself Fury's caretaker of terrorist "problems". The other side of the coin is Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury and Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce. It is nice to see Jackson expanding his role from 1 minute cameo in "Iron Man" to a fully supporting actor here. But the real standout is Robert Redford. Kevin Feige (the producer) probably knows how to do casting because so far there has not been a single acting mistake. Bringing heavy-acting-weight Redford to a superhero film is actually a bold move and while most movies do not focus on the talented cast, here the Russo brothers give Redford plenty of close ups and necessary gravitational dialogue that kept surprised me for a "summer" and "mindless" blockbuster. Antony Mackie plays Falcon believably enough and it is very good to see a great supporting turn instead of being the comedic sidekick. The winter soldier now himself is as you would have expected? probably the best villain outside Loki(!) in the marvel films. A truly unstoppable and cool killing machine that shows no remorse or regret considering his complete disregard (and destructive) actions throughout the film. Shaw manages to bring a bit of menace to a generally light hearted series of fantasy films as he has to act more with his eyes rather than sharing any scenes of actual dialogue.  Is it perfect? Of course not but it does not feel that it is drugging forever or raising any boring flags. There is plenty of plot, intelligence and sweet characters moments to keep anyone satisfying. This is blockbuster at its finest, a superhero film with heart, immersive action and subtle touches of humour. Totally recommended.What should have been a typical superhero film, now becomes a conspiracy-espionage thriller. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the third film in Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (after last year's Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World). Compared with the mighty giant green monster, the hammer wielding Norse thunder god or the 'genius, philanthropist, billionaire, playboy' armor man, the Captain was never quite as appealing as the rest of the 'Unusuals'. Steve Rogers is portrayed as an old-fashioned, straightforward, honest, courageous, sincere, patriotic superhero. This makes him a less-interesting, boring character. Moreover, as Tony Stark said it, "Everything special about you came out of a bottle!" Most film-goers would know that Marvel films are famous for its bright, fun and not-so-serious approach to its storytelling, together with some catchy, witty dialogues. This film is a game changer in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This time around, Marvel decided to take a different approach on things: To make a Captain America sequel with a more serious, darker plot development and more face-to-face close-range hand combat fights. What should have been a typical superhero film, now becomes a conspiracy-espionage thriller. Two years after the events that happened in New York city, the Captain still struggles with adjusting himself to the modern world, with no apparent social life or girl friend, which is why Natasha/Black Widow tries to introduce or recommend him some cute girls in S.H.I.E.L.D. for him to date with. He is shocked when he learns that the very governmental organisation he is working for is not what it seems to be, as the Cap said in the trailer, "This isn't freedom. This is fear". Soon, he finds himself entangled in a conspiracy that puts millions of innocent lives at risk. The film comes with excellent, fast-paced action choreography. Although the cinematography is a bit dodgy due to the shaky-cam techniques used for depicting the chaotic moments, the fight scenes between the Winter Soldier and the Captain is fantastic and serves as one of the film's highlights. The audience finally gets to see how the Captain's shield is utilised effectively in both offensive and defensive combat situations. It also good to see again how Natasha kicks ass in the film. All actors delivered a pretty decent performance in the film. Once again, Chris Evans and Scarlett Johannson both proved that they fit their roles well, adding more depth to the characters they portray in the film. Sam Wilson/Falcon is a welcome addition to the Marvel franchise and hopefully he will appear again in the Avengers sequel. Unfortunately, despite the film's title, the winter soldier is not a complex villain and doesn't appear much in the film. It's such a shame to just show him as a formidable physical fighter who's capable of challenging the Captain. The film is well-scripted, filled with suspense while highlighting some important socio-political issues such as government surveillance and control in its storytelling. Although the twists in the film is predictable and fairly easy to guess, the sequel is a marked improvement compared to its predecessor, Captain America: The First Avenger. The story unfolds gradually and comes with huge, surprising developments by the end of the film. Marvel Cinematic Universe is not going to be the same again. What's going to happen next? How the story is going to progress in Avengers: Age of Ultron, after what had happened in this film? Interesting. Rating: 8.5/10 http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/movie-review-captain-america- winter.html Be warned. This is not the typical fun, 'not-so-serious', entertaining Marvel film that you used to watch in the past. You might like it or find it a bore. In order to recognize some of the characters in the film, you need to remember some of Marvel's Phase One films. Most importantly, you need to watch Captain America: The First Avenger before watching this to understand the plot. Note: Guess you don't need me to remind you to stay for the mid-credit and post-credit scenes. It foreshadows what's going to happen next by introducing a lesser-known supervillain and two new characters, 'Miracles' (another name for 'mutants' because of screen rights issues) which going to be in the Avengers sequel, Age of Ultron. It further confirms that one of weapons depicted in The Avengers is indeed one of the six infinity stones.Marvel makes a bold move! Marvel showed pretty clearly in Iron Man 3 that they are not afraid to take risk, bend comic stories and venture into unknown territories. I was pleasantly surprised by Captain America : The Winter Soldier because Marvel is able to do surprise audience like never before. This movie has mostly everything a fan could ask for. A political drama, conspiracy theories, Chris Evans portrayal of a "out of his time" superhero who is trying to blend in with the world and thinks that "Internet is helpful", typical Marvel's laugh out loud moments and above all some mesmerizing action sequences. Threat in this movie is not as big as the one in Thor :The Dark World since only our tiny planet is at stake rather than entire 9 realms with imaginative difficult to pronounce names, but thanks to some very smart blend of direction, acting and close to perfect background scores, threat seems to be much bigger and more importantly, real this time. You actually care for the fate of entire planet and characters. You do come face to face with the full potential of SHIELD and its structure, its influence on world politics and when the actual villain is revealed, you just cannot hide your excitement. SHIELD acts as a central character in the movie and shows itself to be far bigger and complex than what we suspected after watching all the Marvel offerings. There is Nick Fury as usual hiding secrets, keeping secrets and digging secrets but watching him vulnerable in this movie is much better than watching him acting all almighty in Avengers. Chris Evans shine in this role and I can imagine he won't be at the bottom of favorite Avengers list after this movie. His portrayal of Captain America is near perfect. Scarlett Johansson is a surprise package in the film portraying Black Widow character. She gets ample screen time presence this time, even in scenes where she is not kicking someone. It is actually the first time we learn something about Black Widow, duplicity in her character just adds tension to the already built suspense in the movie. Sebastian Stan is good in his portrayal of winter soldier. He is a perfect nemesis to Captain America in the movie. I bet you haven't seen such creative combat scenes between these two ever before. Action here is not as loud as Thor movies, it is more real, every bullet which find its target hurts, every punch delivered matters, it is so enjoyable to watch just because it is so real. I wish I could write about some more characters but that will be giving away some key points. Please be assured there are some great character comebacks, some you expected, some you didn't. I was a little let down by the climax of the film by its simplicity after the real motive of the real villain is revealed, but of course you have to remember its a Marvel film, there doesn't exist any situation alien/political/social which can't be solved by few explosions and kicks. Overall it's a highly entertaining film from Marvel, I will put it behind only Avengers and first Iron Man, this movie deserves your weekend. And of course it goes without saying, don't dare to leave your seats until last credits have rolled out, you have probably all heard the rumors about Joss Whedon directing the end credit scene. Yes it is awesome and offers an insight into the next Avengers movie.It's smart, intense, well acted and superbly done. AMAZING FILM! I'd have to rate Captain America The Winter Soldier as one of the best comic book movies ever made. It is as close to a perfect movie as you can get. Superman has generally held the title as most fondly remembered or nostalgic superhero film even though it has some campy flaws. Spider- Man has generally held the title as most beloved superhero film because of the character. Iron Man has generally held the most grounded and well liked superhero film. The Avengers has generally held the title as most highly rated and best film the genre has seen. Well, Captain America TWS can compete with them all in every category. It is IMO near perfect on every level. It's smart, intense, well acted, fun and superbly done. The first film delivers a lot of action, a tantalizing and beautiful love interest, many humorous moments, powerful messages about internal fortitude and courage, a classic villain, fine acting and many of the basic essentials of any good action movie. This sequel adds an intriguing plot and does everything the first film did but does it BETTER. Including, incredible stunts, unbelievable feats and, not to be rude, but a climax that plays out like a multiple orgasm. The finish features one wave after another of edge of your seat moments. As fantastic of a movie that's ever been made in the genre and I'm not exaggerating one bit.Solid Thriller I applaud the Russo brothers and the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely on a job well done in this action thriller The action is riveting as are the quite scenes between the characters. There are Good humorous punches in this script also. The returning cast are great and expanding their roles from other movies, I am trying to be vague here as not to ruin the movie. Also there are some great additions to the cast as well. Anthony Mackie does a soaring job as the Falcon (pun intended), he has a very comfortable fit to the cast and no way feel forces in. Robert Redford is a very compelling character and presence on screen. The action scenes were fantastic when I saw the resume of the Russos's movies I was a little worried, now I think they might have to worry about being type cast as action movie directors. There are a few changes from the comic book story line but they are not distracting. The Winter Solider is a movie that greatly expands and shakes the foundation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Stay for the two end credit sequences. I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it. If it's action you want. Go see the Captain.Amazing Cap, Just Amazing!!!!! Another hit from marvel!!! can they do anything wrong. With the success of the recent marvel films, this one again is sure to do well at the box office. whats more pleasantly surprising is that this film is probably the best they've made so far, even rivalling the avengers. I'm sure that with these positive reviews this movie will make upwards of 600 million, beating Thor: the dark world, but i doubt that it will beat iron man 3. however with the success of this movie, i feel that many more people with be eagerly waiting for the third instalment so watch out Batman V superman!!  The acting as expected from Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans and Samuel L. Jackson was excellent. Robert Redford was impeccable in his role and he was worth the effort that Marvel put in to get him on board. The rest of the cast all play their roles extremely well and Marvel have done the right thing by bringing the Falcon in the movie, which was played well by Anthony Mackie. The movie is a great political thriller and i must admit, even without the bonus of superheroes, the script/story is a great movie. The superheroes is what we pay and want to see but the amazing flow of the movie itself should leave many satisfied. The superheroes and villains were all great and i hope we continue seeing the Falcon in the future along with Black Widow. This movie is the most closely linked with The Avengers and also Avengers Age of Ultron, from the rest of the phase 2 films. This is a great movie and one that i highly recommend watching. BTW stay for the end credits for an extra bonus!The most exciting this franchise has been in years When Fury(L. Jackson, tough as usual, for him and these) is attacked by an unknown enemy, the Captain(Evans, will of steel, heart of gold) and Black Widow(Johansson, sultry and devious ‚Äì this uses her right, finally) find themselves(they have a great chemistry, with a charming running gag of her wanting to pair him up with a girl, going through a list of ones they both know; and with his straightforward nature, and her relative lack of integrity, they both affect the other towards them, benefiting both) with no one else to trust, except perhaps the veteran Falcon(Mackie, amiable), as they uncover a genuinely devastating truth, while on the run from a considerable force ‚Äì including the elusive assassin, The Winter Soldier(Stan, terrifying, pure awesome pretty much every second he's on screen). This is just short of the level of The Avengers. It uses the strong continuity of the cinematic Marvel(as in, their own studio) universe better than any of the others, and does justice to many different elements, most of them set up prior to this. Events occur in this that will have serious consequences for future entries. The plot-driven nature and approach of a 70's political thriller(where some characters, all credible and with something to do, happen to wear a flag or the like) in a contemporary setting and with biting satire(on foreign policy, something not entirely new to these, but never before this sharp¬Ö commenting on mass surveillance and executions taking place before any trial against the (supposed) perpetrator) is spot-on. From a 40's war flick, with heroism and defined lines between good and evil, to the modern method of taking on the opposition ‚Äì with spying, and questionable tactics(compared to one army versus another). The action all comes about naturally, it's personal, hard-hitting and, on account of next to no CGI, it's "real". Each intense set-piece is varied(fighting, shooting, chasing both on foot and vehicular¬Ö), you will remember them, and except for one bit, they feel fresh and original. Among the very few weaknesses are that Sharon(VanCamp, another compelling and strong woman) has nothing to do in this, appearing as if her important scenes were cut, and/or that she was setup for the next one. She is the only one that that goes for, a pleasant surprise considering the seemingly bloated cast of characters. This explores S.H.I.E.L.D., and how the iconic super soldier fits into it ¬Öor, whether or not he does, at all. The 3D is unobtrusive, adding depth and atmosphere, similar to Avatar. There is violence and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of, well, blockbusters. 10/10When Captain America throws his mighty Shield !!!!!!! This movie Rocks!!!!!! At first, I wasn't very confident about watching a captain America movie because he looked kind of old-school. But when I watched this movie - BOOM !!!!!!! This movie blew my mind.... It is really AWESOME!!! There are many sequences that will make you jump up in your seats. And though I have not included any spoilers, I would like to recommend you to stay after the credits for two amazing scenes, now this is hardly a spoiler as everyone knows marvel always treats the audience with surprising after credits scenes. I shall say no more here. Marvel has done an excellent job on this movie. Chris Evans has done some excellent work as Captain America. But Scarlett Johansson as Black widow steals the movie. Her character is evergreen as usual.Others to look forward to are Sebastian Stan as the winter soldier and Anthony Mackie as The Falcon. I highly recommend this movie. Guys, this movie is really worth your bucks. Moreover, the movie runs for over 136 mins, but never at a single moment during the movie you feel bored. And the ending of the movie leaves you craving for more and more. The climax is terrific. I haven't seen such an awesome climax of a movie since the Avengers. So guys, go for this movie.... take your kids with you. They'll love it. It is a perfect start of summer blockbuster and one of the best movies of the year without doubt..Triple A logic error popcorn cinema Captain America The Winter Soldier is supposed to be a AAA Hollywood movie. Apparently this means that it only needs explosions to be good. If you dare to demand a logical consistent story you will be unsatisfied. The acting is good, the explosions are just the same as in every other marvel movie. The story is very obvious and the supposedly surprising changes are foreseeable by a 10 year old. My biggest problem is the logical inconsistency. In the following a few examples: SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The propulsion of Director Furys car is destroyed by an explosion, and the damage is fixed by restarting the PC of the car. highly impossible no matter the technological level. A broken wrist is healed by antibiotics, during a fighting scene. Even so this might be useful in the long term healing of the wrist, but during a gunfight it's probably not the most important thing to do. Director Furys car has a stationary gun inside the vehicle. This gun safes the live of Fury, however it doesn't explain why it even exists. This gun can only be used to attack people inside the car, why is it stationary? This scenes shows that many gadgets the heroes used were designed by the writes exactly for this one scene, instead they should've tried to create gadgets which might be realistic, and then change the scenes so that the gadgets make a sense, not vice versa. Fury escapes heavily injured through a hole in the ground. The bad guy super soldier is maybe 2 seconds behind him and doesn't hunt him down by following him into the hole. Why? He is faster, younger and healthier, why not try to follow him? Surely Fury wouldn't have been able to outrun him if the Winter solider would have tried. The big airships have a very important PC core. This core is extremely important, still it is positioned at the bottom of the airship and protected by glass. They chose to position the most important part of the airship at the least defendable and least protected position. wtf? why?Absolute Captain Crud OK, where to begin. This film had no creativity at all to it. I guess they ran out of ideas in the avengers, which was a great film. Who ever wrote this and got paid for it should have their head read. How much can and should you change the laws of physics to make something 'believable'. Plot holes as follows : Captain America has a shield the size of a large pizza and no one ever shoots at his legs or feet, only directly into the shield; Hundreds of what would be green berets equivalent, highly trained killers can not hit any human moving or non moving targets with rifles and machine guns; Nick Furys car that is getting attacked seems to have no external defence at all, not a single gun or weapon, instead, let's put a gun inside that has to shoot through bullet proof material, so we will wait till all that bullet proof material is gone and then try to shoot through an obstacle at highly trained professionals who can't hit nick when he is stationary and in complete view (fwoh); gigantic million ton airships fall slowly to the ground after all thrusters are gone; apparently reducing your heart beat to one pulse per minute can keep you alive; head of organisation is bad guy, shock horror shock (sarcasm) and so on, couldn't be bothered typing more. So see this if you are brainless, but if you actually like plot and good acting, see something else. I gave it 2 for the Apple Store scene.Marvel Less "Lotta things you don't know about me," Nick Fury tells Captain America¬Ö And he could also be talking to the theater audience since so far, through several films, the monotone, monologue-spouting S.H.I.E.L.D chief has been kept on the peripheral¬Ö And now he, along with former Russian agent Natasha, can step into the co-lead spotlight, which sadly winds up casting an extremely dull glow on everyone¬Ö Especially our hero, Steve Rogers, who literally starts out in a brisk, humorous pace and then has a bland pop culture conversation with fellow soldier Sam Wilson, played by Anthony Mackie, a forced sidekick eventually donning his winged-costume befitting a bad cartoon, awkwardly contrasting to the gloomy plot that's part James Bond, part political thriller... The latter where Robert Redford, as a stiff-suited wolf in sheep's clothing, fits like a dreary glove. Between spurts of bombastic action are lofty conversations about American defense, questionable freedom, and glimpses into the first movie including a pointless visit to Steve's old stomping grounds¬Ö This occurs after Sam Jackson's Fury has his very own car chase leading to the introduction of a stealthy, long-haired assassin with limitless fighting skills, equal to Captain America, and whose real identity adds to the melodrama. (Tony Stark, where are you? These people take themselves way too seriously!)  The only good parts that seem worthy of ‚Äì or that were already wasted and/or spoiled on ‚Äì theatrical trailers happen much too fast while the head villain's wag-the-dog goal is not only clich√©, but for a world derived from comic book origins, and following up the cinematic spectacle that is THE AVENGERS, this uneven, uninspired SOLDIER is no fun at all...Overlong Film Puts Audience to Sleep! Captain America lacks humor, engaging plot and script, relying solely on special effects and promotions to get box office honors! And to make matters worse, it dragged on forever! It was a silent audience for the entire 2 hours, not a chuckle was heard, and when it was finally over, the audience just walked out the door with not a soul staying for credits or musical score. From start to end, this was just a mish-mash of unengaging computer imagery, with so many scenes of shoot-em-up violence, shattered glass and chaos that it got boring within the first half hour. Camera work was shaky, editing poor with overly long scenes, and actors either miscast or just reading their lines without impact.And if there was a music score, I sure don't remember it.  And good acting just wasn't there. The CaptainAmerica actor used a faint persona drawn from Tom Cruise, who, with his intensity and charisma, would have raised the movie to a higher level. His strong woman cohort, played by Scarlett Johanson, was especially lackluster, with her only notable expression being frowning occasionally. And, casting an aged Robert Redford as villain was poor casting extraordinaire! Redford lacked energy, intensity, and physical presence as an actor. If you enjoy watching a Hollywood-style extravaganza with 90% special effects and actors sleep-walking through their lines, Captain America is for you! Even our 14 year-old for whom this movie was probably made, said "we should have gone to Spiderman!"Be warned this movie "sucks" I am going to put spoilers in this review, but it will probably be more entertaining than the actual movie. To the point. Nothing happens in this movie that you haven't seen in every other movie. Captian America is involved in a conspiracy that involves the company he works for- seen it. Captian America looses his leader and must try to figure out the differnce right and wrong-seen it. Captian America must stop a world power- seen it. blah blah blah. This movie is nothing but a repeat of movie scenes that made good movies 15 years ago. Captian America defeats the bad guy, only to save the bad guy. The same action cost him is life, Oh wait, some mysterious arm has reached out to save Captian Americas life.... who could it be. I was in total suspense for .27 seconds. Captian America gets on a Shield intercom system and warns everybody that the bad guy ( the same bad guy from 70 years prior) had taken control and should be stopped-at all cost. Given a liberating speech to all who can hear-seen it. Problem is who on board can remember or even is aware of and evil group from 70 years ago. Scarlett Jo. looked terrible, fake tan, everyone wore pink lipstick. I can get past a terrible story line if things looked good, but.... Of coarse Captin America had to get his old suit out- seen it. Absoultey nothing of any importance happens in this movie. Tha bad guy isn't stopped, the "death" of a leader didn't happen, the world isn't a better place. Captin America says Shield has to be stopped....So he shoots down 3 airplanes. WTC... I think Shield is a little bigger than 3 air planes. All the movie is, is a TV episode. The bad guy is still there, There are still problems to deal with , and the stakes got higher. No wait its not a TV episode, its a sitcom.the stench explodes I was forced to watch this horror by people who should have known me better. (The only movie I really wanted to watch this week was a Polish film, Ida, which was playing nowhere). Godalmighty, what a stinker this was. Character development? None. Dialogue? Laughable. Plot? Who knows. Against a ridiculous and badly done Washington process screen, I saw a ton of cgi star trek crap, mostly consisting in four-frame quick-cut scenes of people (?} kicking each other to no effect, a hell of a lot of useless machine-gun fire to equal effect, and explosions filling the screen followed by firy explosions filling self-same screen, giving way to yet more kicking and firy explosions. It did occur to me that I was not the target audience for this total crap, but then, as I have said, I was dragged to it.Superb. This could be the best sequel the genre has seen. This film finds Captain America still adjusting to the modern day, while working under the increasingly morally ambiguous government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. The set up is masterfully done. This is the third time we've seen the character and it's by far the most complex. The Avengers film touched bit with his feelings of what it was like to be in the modern era, but besides the deleted scenes, they had no time to dive in to the subject matter in that movie. That's not the case here. This is a wonderful character study to go along with a purely thrilling plot. This was exactly the perfect vehicle to deliver the film the character deserves at this time. What makes Steve/cap interesting isn't his abilities but the man himself. The "man out of time" to be exact. He must come to terms with a past that is long gone and a longing for a better more decent era. Dealing with the shades of grey of the modern era and being part of an organization like S.H.I.E.L.D. is taking its toll on a member of "the greatest generation." As he's finding his way, his past comes back and explodes all throughout his new life. Enter The Winter Soldier, who is an amoral assassin and an agent of shady government rogues. Saying any more about what is an ultimately cool character would be a spoiler. Fans of the books know who he is and what he's about but movie fans need to find their own way.  I really enjoyed the origin and First Avenger but this movie is darker than the original film. It has a whole new flavor and that;s exactly what was needed. The 1940's romance and even the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" tone fit the first film quite nicely but would have been out of place in this story. Just like Cap, adaptation is a key. Steve is still an unquestioning patriot but he shifts from being an unquestioning soldier. This is where his old-fashioned values pay off. Questioning what is wrong and questioning what is morally cloudy is a test of true character. That is exactly why the character of Steve Rogers is so interesting. He's so much more than a super soldier boy scout. There's depth, angst and pathos to the max. He is out-of-place and he is old- fashioned but proud of that in a way. He also is an enhanced thinker so it's not like modern era gadgets confound him. It's all played just right.  The story itself is a good old fashion action thriller with a ton of intrigue. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be this clever. Everything about this movie is a joy to watch. Tha cast is perfect and everyone is used exceptionally well. This could be the best sequel the genre has seen. It's Marvel's best sequel for sure.seriously? we all know that marvel films sometimes lack in plot, but in such cases they usually compensate with: a)humor b)good acting c)creativity and originality. this film - none of that whatsoever. a predictable plot (first 10 minutes and you already know who the bad guy is), shallow characters, disappointing acting, tedious action scenes with only loud noises to keep you awake...simply a tragedy. The few quips here and there are far from enough for a two hour movie, which on top of that presents quite a dull, grayish setting - no eye candy at all (shame on you marvel). and for a character who pretty much makes up the title of the movie, the winter soldier was...just there - no impressive lines, no stable back story. i think that this movie aimed a bit too high, but ended up being illogical, painfully predictable and all in all - laughable. marvel tried serious? well, marvel failed at serious.Shootout at the OK Corral A special effects extravaganza with a plot as thin as a wet tissue, best describes this "moving picture." (I hesitate to use the term.) And move it does‚Äîall the time, all over the screen, and all over what svelte plot there is. In essence, this film is a remake of the classic 1957 film Shootout at the OK Corral. Today's film mise en scene in current day and instead of six-shooters we see futuristic weapons that could wipe out mankind/womankind/etc.. There is the good guy and his sidekick (naturally), the good/bad/good female, the hard-as-nails. know-it-all top gun; and, of course the eeevil big-time manager who plans to rule the world. Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease!. Here's this fellows scheme: his cadre has pinpointed millions of people to be terminated because they are miscreants, old, sick, stupid, nonproductive, etc. As a result, the remaining folks will live in a Utopian society under his control. Does this sound familiar circa, 1933- 1945? At times, the dialogue is so trite and spoken so ineptly that I slid down in my seat; embarrassed for the patrons in the theater with me who had to listen and see this tripe. There is not one character in this charade of a film that engenders empathy‚Äîno one with whom we can identify, no situation or location that renders true. It's impossible to willing suspension disbelief in this film‚Äîthe audience's keystone to a successful moving-picture. This film is nonsense, idiotic, stupid, and a waste of time. Save you money. Stay home.Shaky Cam and Rehashed Action Ruins It Moviegoers above the age of 13 will recognize most of the action set pieces and plot elements from other films. There's an elevator fight, which we've seen before. Evil cops, evil suits, "big brother" danger, some running from fire and more explosions.  The fundamental problem with these movies is that you never feel like the main characters are in any danger. No matter how much of a beating Captain America takes, he's going to live to make sequels. The same goes for all of the popular cast members. Given the immortality of the good guys, the only question is How they're going to get out of peril. Don't expect anything new here. The best writing is happening on television, sadly. Film-quality writing is going to HBO and independent networks, and television directors are moving to the big screen. This one is all washed up. Hail hydra.Definitely one for the die-hard Marvel fans Saturday night. Nothing to do. I know, let's go to the cinema! My friend suggested that we go to see this film. I recall (dimly) seeing the first Captain America film but for some reason I couldn't make any sense of the beginning of this one. It seems that I must have missed a Captain America film at some point as there were lots of references to plot events of which I was completely unaware. Understandably this significantly detracted from my enjoyment. There is a lot of action in this film; having said that there was only one point at which this succeeded in engaging my attention. Sadly all of it was fairly formulaic cartoon violence, with indestructible people able to withstand the kind of physical traumas that would leave a normal person either hospitalised or deceased. There is also some acting. Not particularly good acting, mind you; the characters seemed to be paper-thin in many cases and the cast gave the impression that they were not hugely interested in anything other than their pay packet. A plot was present but at this stage I am not interested enough to comment on it. In summary, if you are a huge fan of mindless Marvel comic films and in particular Captain America then you will lap this up and rave about it to your adolescent friends over a Big Mac while simultaneously Facebooking on your smart phone. Adults should probably spend their money on something else.Another Marvel Movie. Nothing More. I wanted to start this review by saying that Captain America: The Winter Soldier is astonishingly bad, but that gives it too much credit: The Winter Soldier is not astonishing in any way. It is yet another mediocre superhero movie from Marvel. It teased at interesting questions, like, "Is it okay to kill people to prevent them from killing people?" but all it did was tease. The movie changes up Marvel's movie universe a little bit, but for what purpose? So another superhero can save the day next year in a slightly different way while uttering slightly different one-liners? In the end, the movie is about an uncompromising good guy who saves people from dying. That's not interesting in the world of fiction; it's overused.Marvel Slays it Once Again! Bravo!!! I had a feeling that Captain America: Winter Soldier would be an amazing movie once the trailer was released. Turns out, I couldn't be more accurate. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not the usual superhero movie, it underlies a dark theme of politics and conspiracy beneath it. Haunting pasts, betrayals and fake deaths all come into play. In this film, we get to see Steve Rogers' full potential in terms of his heroism and leadership. When the leader of S.H.E.I.L.D., Nick Fury, takes the fall, it is up to Steve Rogers to determine the fate of S.H.E.I.L.D and most importantly, the livelihood of mankind. As the stoic and fearless hero that he is, Rogers takes charge and enlists the help of Natasha Romanoff aka The Black Widow as well as a new sidekick, Sam Wilson aka Falcon, to defeat HYDRA. He exuberates skills that we have never seen before with his gravity defying flips, kicks and punches, even single handedly defeating a whole vessel of villains. It is also exciting to see the strong bond between Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon. The trios are as loyal as ever to one another, never once faltering despite near death scenarios and with multitude obstacles being hurled their way like a violent hurricane. They displayed excellent teamwork in the process of defeating the baddies. The movie also sheds some light and heart-warming moments as well. The playful and snarky banter between good friends Natasha and Steve is fun to watch. The escalator scene, anyone? Also, the scene between Steve and his former love, Peggy was priceless. Here, we get to see the vulnerable and raw side of the Captain which he hides so well on a daily basis. This film is a perfect blend of thrill, action and drama with an intriguing plot. The action sequences are plentiful; there is not just one "special" moment. I was gawking and gripping the edge of my seat throughout the movie. The stunts are top notch and are the best in its genre, perhaps even triumphing the likes of action movies. There are tons of extraordinary fighting combats, insane car chases and fiery explosions that would blow you off your feet. All the actors did a splendid job in portraying their characters convincingly, particularly Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson. Scarlett has a major role and takes up pretty much most of the screen time; so take note of this, fanboys. Captain America: Winter Soldier has claim its spot as the best Marvel movie ever produced in my list as it exceeds my expectations in every single way. I daresay it is even better than The Avengers (It is a large statement to make as I am a massive Avengers fan). I can't wait to see the next installment of the Captain America sequel and The Avengers: Age of Ultron. Bring it on, Marvel!Hollywood at its worst EVER Never have I watched a movie with so many clich√©d lines, excessive use of firearms and complete lack of credible story line. Plot twists were tedious and lines were forced and overacted. I believe Marvel has taken a turn for the worst. Why couldn't have been as well acted and written as the Avengers? Instead we are given a mockery of all superhero movies to date. We have been presented with unnecessary amounts of CGI and guns and killing. Superhero movies are supposed to present morals. How can a superhero movie depict a couple of characters running around shooting at each other and killing massive amounts of people in the process. In my opinion just plain awful. I can't but I'd rather give it a 0/10. (Only giving this review for the people with good taste in movies and are not forced to watch it like I was)Captain America loses his respect. Perfect pace and compelling script; with only one fault possible, maybe too much action. Anthony and Joe Russo direct this screenplay adaption of a Marvel comic by Jack Kirby and Joe Simon. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) is brought out of suspended animation to find a much different world; one in which S.H.I.E.L.D has suffered many dark situations and Captain America himself is labeled a villain and much sought after person of interest. The plot may be spread a little thin, as someone from Steve Roger's past proves to be his major antagonist. The "Winter Soldier" (Sebastian Stan) will cause two of Captain America's friends from the past, Nick Fury (Samuel J. Jackson) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), come to the aid of the star-spangled super hero. An astute cast also features: Robert Redford, Cobie Smulders, Toby Jones, Anthony Mackie, Emily VanCamp, Maximilliano Hernandez and Stan Lee.Captain America: The Winter Soldier******** Taking over the director's chair for the Captain America franchise is the Russo Brothers (Anthony Russo &amp; Joe Russo), they did not disappoint, it was a step up from Captain America: The First Avenger, and I was a fan of the first movie. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a smart and an engaging film. A more realistic take, reducing the work of CGI to a degree in favor of some retro action. The story was suspenseful and I've gotta say, good character development as well. Chris Evans does a great job at playing the role of a good friend trying to save a good friend. Also I was very impressed with Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes/Winter Solider, along with everyone else, they did a solid job. If this is the direction, the series is headed, I'm all for it.A very pleasant surprise Captain America 2014 is a very pleasant surprise. It is a plain action movie that goes for the thrills. I still have better memories from Commando and Robocop, but this is good too for a light evening entertainment. The script goes smooth with holes not big enough to be obvious during this roller coaster ride. And I am sure this one is faster paced than the late 1980s offers. Sadly, this is nothing more than brainless entertainment. The script and probably the whole Captain America franchise seems to be made by socialists convinced that all humans need is 'good' leadership. How can one tell the good from the bad? Well, obviously you haven't seen the movie. The good ones are the side we choose, otherwise all the teams are indistinguishable in their wacky race to rule the World. Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.chMarvel is leaving a good impression on franchise-cinema. The Winter Soldier is such an improvement over The First Avenger you'd find it hard to believe that they're part of the same series; don't get me wrong: The First Avenger was entertaining, but I thought it was more pedestrian than this film. The Winter Soldier is like putting Captain America into a James Bond film and S.P.E.C.T.R.E. has been a more immediate threat than we thought. Marvel does use a lot of the tropes of typical superhero cinema: cameos galore, references in-universe, and sequel-building; the difference being that the events feel more immediate to what's currently happening. The Winter Soldier stands out from The Avengers crowd, pretty well I might add. Captain America has gone up in the world since being in one of the 90's worst movies ever made (Captain America|1991): The First Avenger redeemed that partially, and The Winter Soldier effectively gave the character a complete turnaround and he's kept driving straight since. Of course I'm writing this after Captain America: Civil War came out and I can say that THAT film is the strongest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe thus far, but The Winter Soldier is still a personal favourite of mine. Steve Rogers is a freedom fighter in this film, and it does seem that Chris Markus and Steve McFreely wrote the script celebrating Edward Snowden's leaking of the NSA's global surveillance scheme. The Winter Soldier does play out like a regular superhero film, but it has more underlying themes than usual 'lets-bash-the-baddie-real-good' stuff, and Captain America wants to save the world from the control of totalitarian-hungry tyrants. On the surface Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a comic book movie full of stereotypical traits of superhero movies: underneath it actually breaks down what the character stands for, just like The Dark Knight did with Batman; we get the heroes we deserve but not the ones we need. We need to go through hardships to get the heroes we deserve, and Captain America is a character respecting this struggle.New World Order has arrived The sequel to Captain is a great thriller picking up where he unthalls from the ice to begin his life again and adjust to a changed world. When S.H.E.I.L.D is compromised by an assassin Winter Solider, Captain and Black Wideoe must stop his plan to sabotage the world government and implement a new world order.  I love the chemistry between the two leads and could feel the passion between them as they struggle against it to focus on the task at hand. Rogers has great comedic timing as he tries to understand how technology works and amazed by the new fashion women have adapted. His sincerity is ever present bringing the heart and soul of Cap to the screen which isn't an easy feat. Another praise goes to Marcus and McFeely for investing the story line back to the Nazis as hydra was developed by the evil organization to being the world to its knees. It elevates the danger imposed as heroes around the globe are left without data or can communicate between each other leaving them defenseless. While resolving plot holes in why the other Avengers can't join in the action. The fighting sequences were limited compared to the first but are styles and used to perfection as usual. The winter Solider was fantastic and even better them the first in my opinion.Evolving The real-life lessons: again with these kind of movies there is not much to this area, besides maybe the trending topic that you have to think by yourself because everyone else might have their own agenda.  Character development: strangely enough there was not much depth and development in main characters. Alexander Pierce strangely enough was the one that developed to an extend in the end. He gave reasons why he supported what he supported but why those reasons were his in the first place, was not explained. There was a failed attempt in my opinion, in developing Steve Rogers character by the dilemma he was having about how to fit in the new world at the beginning. But that dimmer somehow just seemed to disappear and was not deep enough. And it was bot well presented how he managed to escape it.  Storytelling: very well done in my opinion. It had its twists and surprises and was never quite enough and without action. It kept you interested and engaged. It evolved quite nicely and made time pass by quite quickly.  One more thing I liked about this movie- Steve and Natasha. They were a quite delightful duo.Edward Snowden Strikes Back Captain America: The Winter Soldier fixes some of my complaints of the first movie. In my review for The First Avenger, I opined that I never felt convinced about the relationship between Steve Rogers and his best friend Bucky Barnes. This film does a much better job going back and delving into that relationship to make it seem more convincing and relevant. If you are wondering why I mention Bucky Barnes in a movie called the Winter Soldier, well, connect the dots and keep in mind that I did warn you with a spoiler alert. Scarlet Johansson is at her best as Black Widow as the relationship between her and Captain America really develops as she finally takes responsibility for her previous mistakes. Also, Anthony Mackie is a wonderful addition to the Avengers as Falcon and seems like less of a throwaway than Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye. I believe the film does a decent job mulling over the moral implication of mass surveillance programs, and you even feel some empathy for some of the villains and their goals. As a result, Captain America: The Winter Soldier does seem to be the most morally relevant of the MCU films to date. My only complaint with this film is it seems a bit rushed at some points and the plot comes together a bit too conveniently; it seems like a lot has to go right (or wrong depending on which side you are) for things to come together in the epic finale. I guess I'm just not convinced that so many people (police, S.H.I.E.L.D., politicians) were working on the bad side without there being leaks. Maybe I'm naive but maybe not. The Winter Soldier gets 3.5 out of 4 hydras.The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078 What can you say about Marvel films that hasn't been said already? When Marvel started making movies, with the exception of Batman, I hated superheroes, I hated everything about them. I had written them off as the lowest, cheapest form of science fiction, and the first few Marvel films did little to prove me wrong, but then they started getting better, and arguably the best films in the franchise, or at least my favorites have been the Captain America films. Chris Evans is just terrific, he has this innocent naivet√© about him surrounded in a childlike wonderment, but when the time comes, he can still kick some ass and even crack a joke, Evans just fits the role like a glove. There's not much point summarizing the story, because if you're not into the whole Marvel scene, you're probably not going to understand or see this film anyway, and that's a shame, because from a visual stand point alone, The Winter Soldier rivals anything Marvel has put out to date. On that note, the one draw back to this film is there is a lot of Avenger story line involved. This is supposed to be a stand alone film, fans of the series loved it and rightfully so, but what about the people who just like the character and aren't into the whole genre? All the other Avenger/Shield/Hydra stuff and other characters from other series could make the story for them more than somewhat confusing. In watching this film, you almost have to have some kind of background knowledge of the characters involvement in other films in order to be in the know and that doesn't sit right with people, particularly kids, who just want to see Captain America. For the fans, however it doesn't get much better than this, it's slightly longer and rougher around the edges than The First Avenger, but it is still a great film, and a must see for anyone is trying to keep with the Marvel franchise.A great superhero political thriller! "Winter Soldier" is a step up from "The First Avenger," as this movie is more gripping with its political thriller theme and the suspense and action-oriented elements. The evil Hydra organization from the first Captain America movie takes on a more sinister role as they infiltrate Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow's (Scarlett Johansson) S.H.I.E.L.D. department to launch a powerful weapon against humanity. There are plenty of unpredictable moments, from character trust issues to espionage elements, that make this film full of surprises and a good dose of comic relief where appropriate - not forced comedy or overdone stuff like the Thor movies. Solid acting and a to-the-point plot, this is a great superhero film, overall, and one of the best from Marvel. Grade AMuch better than the first Captain America movie I was disappointed by the first Captain America film, so I was pleased that I found myself liking 'The Winter Soldier'. Director Fury has a prominent role - he is hounded out of his position and almost killed. So Captain America finds himself in a position where he doesn't know who to trust. That said, he seems to trust Black Widow, who he quickly teams up with and who also features heavily in this movie. And that's just the start of it. Together, Captain America and Black Widow uncover a truly sinister secret at the heart of the organisation they work for. It's all delivered with perfectly good fight scenes and character interaction throughout. The sinister plot is unravelled at a steady pace, meaning it's easy to stay interested right up to the climax. My major criticism is that I don't find the characters all that engaging. Captain America is a boringly clean-cut hero, and the bad guys didn't seem very memorable.From Yay to Nay ! At first, you feel that you're in for a superhero super action. But then, you feel that you're in the titanic, while its sinking !  Let me cut to the chase : If Nick Fury has a device that transports him from place to another in nanosecond; why he didn't runaway from the car while the attack on him ? And if he knew that Captain America's safe house is being watched; why he went to it ? And if the evil guy knew that he was there; why didn't he kill him earlier ? And if Fury assigned a girl to protect Captain America undercover; why she didn't act professionally and observe anything else that the radio's music was on ? And if Alexander Pierce (played by Robert Redford) had a device that could kill all the board's members; why he didn't use it since the start ? And if that so-called device could kill; how Black Widow (played by Scarlett Johansson) didn't die out of it ? And if Fury died, and became SO DEAD; how he was alive again ?! And please, can anybody sane tell me how Hydra was controlling S.H.I.E.L.D. during 70 years ??!! So whether the script finds it enjoyable to not telling us the answers, or DOESN'T KNOW THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE! As you see, this should have been named Captain America : Power of Idiocy, or Captain America : The Whys and The Hows ! In the climactic sequence, the script nearly committed suicide. If The Winter Soldier saved his friend in the end, how come he would be a menace afterwards ?! And it seemed to me that Falcon (played by Anthony Mackie) transformed into hero haphazardly. It's as if anybody Captain America might meet in his life would be a hero, good or bad one, later ! And, for the love of God, how Captain America wants to sacrifice himself, again, for saving the world, again, after the first movie ?! I believe that there is some unofficial rule that says "Do not repeat the first movie's end in its sequel". But I believe that it takes clever people to apply it as well ! The dialog is beyond silly, the information are being thrown at you faster than raindrops in a terrible torrent, and the clich√© of "Kiss me, so the bad guys can't find us" is hateful among all the other clich√©s, since they look at it as the most trite ! The whole cast is infected with the epidemic of Woodenness. Johansson and Mackie were the most sick. However, it was more than painful to see the honorable Mr. Redford turning into wood ! When I heard that he would play a role in a movie finally, and that role was in a commercial movie, that happened to be a superhero blockbuster‚ÄîI was surprised and enthusiastic. I remember things like praising the movie's makers for convincing him to do so, and envying them for having him too. But, eventually, it was the peak of frustration when he looked like a perfect Robert Redford pod. Regrettably, he wasn't evil as a character, but he was so evil as an actor ! The movie is overall heavy. It's 136 minutes, yet feels more than that already. The direction of the dramatic scenes was TV-ish. I lived a soap-opera disguised as a sci-fi action thriller. And it came with all the mortal sins; from the lifeless cadres to the awful acting ! On the contrary, the direction of the action did awesome sequences. The CGI approached greatness. There were creative, really cool, new weapons. And the Neo-Nazism's plan to take over the world digitally was absolutely fantastic. However, if you think that the virtues' list is long.. Be sure, the vices' list is longer !  In its first 2 movies, Captain America pushed me to the "This will rock" yell, to end up with a "Rock the boat" situation. Frankly, after this one's end, the boat tanked, and I found myself singing "My heart will NOT go on" ! ..Nevertheless, I hope that part 3 will be better than so-so, because I got fed up with 2 of that kind !Marvel's The Dark Knight. I remember the days I watched this film twice. I watched it with my mother once then I watched it again this time with my sister at the Director's Club. I had a nice experience watching the Phase One Marvel films from the original Iron Man until The Avengers because Phase One marks the beginning of this incredible Cinematic Universe Marvel has made. I did enjoy the first Captain America movie but this sequel takes it to a whole new level in terms of style, execution and storytelling which by the way is full of surprises that has never been done in a Marvel movie. To my surprise I like this film even better than the first film because ever since Iron Man 3 Marvel is brave enough when making their movies, they seriously showed proof when this film was made and makes you feel excited about the next Phase Two Marvel films. First of the action is intense and well choreographed. Everything in the movie is superbly suspenseful and very intense all the action scenes are well done combined with outstanding realistic practical effects and less CGI. Second of all the story is well paced and amazing. When the Winter Soldier appears on screen for the first time it was so shocking and intense how he was introduced. Last but not least the overall execution is amazing because this film is not only a Superhero film, but it also acts as a Conspiracy Thriller in the vein of Three Days At The Condor and The Parallax View along with The Dark Knight since both movies deal with similar themes and just imagine this movie being directed and written by Christopher Nolan and you get the idea of this film and the performances of the casts is really cool and amazing at the exact same time. If I would rate this film I would give it a complete 10 out of 10.One of the best movie sequels out there As a fan of superhero movies and the first captain America movie ( which some people like and others hate) I had my doubts going into this movie but boy was i surprised, the action scenes in this movie were well choreographed, the story was as compelling as it could get and the plot twist at the end is one to look out for. Captain America winter soldier shows how captain America adjusts to modern life and while he begins to build trust with men of today, he gets very betrayed before meeting up with something from the past which he thought was gone. As this film comes from people who directed only comedy before it is a very big shock that one of the best comic book movies comes from them. Bravo is all i can say!!!!!A modern film with a twist of retro themes and cold wars The Captain is back, and this time he's in the present. While the first film dealt with a back-story/ origin you may remember that at the end of the film Roger's is brought into the future after being frozen in ice for some 50-60 years. A lot has happened in that time and in between films you'll have to make the assumption that he has been debriefed and brought up to speed on the world which has changed significantly. If you search online you'll find a nice chronological viewing order so you know how to watch the films and where they sit on a chronological list; for the purpose of this lets say that the events of the first Avengers film have unfolded, as have all the Iron Man films and just before this Cpt America film Thor 2's events have also occurred. In this film you kind of get some of the fallout of those prior events (Shield is taking a lot of stick for events in the Avengers movie as well as the Iron Man films and is getting pressured to be safer and strong with controls in place) as well as things that spill out of Cpt America's past from the first film. Steve has a lot to catch up on and just when he's making friends (The Falcon) and finding his feet in the modern world Nick Fury is killed by an assassin working for Hydra. In fact Hydra have infiltrated Shield and parts of the American (and World) government so who can Cpt America rely on. Trusting nobody it's up to Rogers, Widow and Falcon to try and stop the assassin called the Winter Soldier and save the world, even when it looks like they are on the wrong side of justice because Hydra has infiltrated and corrupted most of the ruling bodies.  The stars of the first film and other recent Marvel films all deliver credible performances, that's Evans as Cpt America, Samuel L. Jackson as Fury, and Johansson as Black Widow. Introducing Widow into this film was clever as it allowed an emotional probe and outlet for Rogers, typical of a man from the 30/40's he's very private and doesn't let his emotions out, he is absolutely a man out of time, using Black Widow to help convey his hidden pain was very effective and gives the characters an additional layer of depth. I have to mentioned Sebastian Stan for his performance in this film, he's still Bucky Barnes but he's also the Winter Soldier and as a brainwashed assassin he does really well and suits the role. Anthony Mackie is introduced as Sam Wilson/ Falcon and makes a decent first showing. Cobie Smulders works well as Maria Hill and I am expecting more great things from her to come. Frank Grillo (Brock Rumlow) lays decent foundations for a role which is set to get bigger if you recognise his name from the comics. Toby Jones (Dr Zola) is just as creepy in this as he is in the first film despite not making a physical appearance.  I enjoyed this film as much, if not more than the first Cpt America film and other MCU films. It showed lots of clever depth with it's plots and sub-plots all unfolding at once and laid some great foundations for the 3rd Cpt America film which is set to put a 'cat amongst the pigeons'. This film is fast paced and very clever. It uses themes used throughout film and politics in the 60's, 70's and 80's including paranoia, secret societies and agendas, world domination, cold wars, and so on. This is not just a superhero movie but also a spy/action film with romance, heartache, reflection and ultimately a heart. 8 out of 10Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) Seeing this movie made me quickly realize that in comparison, it is better than the first one. I thought it was a bit of an improvement, which is one reason why I think it is a stronger film. When watching it, I thought it started off rather confusing when the people in the beginning were being held captive on a vessel and I think it was mainly because it wasn't clear straightaway who the character Agent Rumlow was, at least to me. I wondered if it was the result of HYDRA still being active and had members within S.H.I.E.L.D. There were a lot of things that were explained as the film went on, but I was just kind of confused by that beginning. I like the character of Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans). I liked the way he questioned S.H.I.E.L.D. As oppose to just blindly following orders because nowadays our government is far more corrupt then it was in his day. He's basically anti-establishment, like he wasn't for imprisoning people or enslaving people. Although this takes place two years after The Avengers, I like how it is also a continuation to The First Avenger. That was probably where I was confused, considering I have not seen The Avengers movie yet. The character of Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier made for a very compelling villain. The entire storyline of Captain America realizing his friend is the enemy is very heartfelt and gripping. I appreciate the measures he goes through to try to save him. Through every account of their final fight. He never stops trying to save Bucky. I love that aspect. Steve Rogers is constantly trying to get through to him throughout the fight. Even till the very end. He never gives up on his friend. They've known each other all of their lives and Steve Rogers aka Captain America did not want to give up on that. That really is a powerful scene. All of the action scenes are very well done throughout. Also, I like Black Widow and Falcon. I thought they were excellent.One of my favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe movies! The second Captain America movie sees Steve Rogers in the present day after the events of the first Avengers. Steve meets Sam Wilson, played by Anthony Mackie, in the park at the start and this friendship proves to be fruitful as he turns out to be the Falcon with a very cool suit of wings that allow him to fly. Captain works missions with S.H.I.E.L.D. and Black Widow, played by Scarlett Johansson, and Brock Rumlow, played by Frank Grillo.  There are a lot conspiracy and the movie turns into a political thriller with Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, discovering that Agents of Shield are not to be trusted. He is attacked by the the mysterious Winter Soldier in an awesome car chase, and injured badly. His only hope for help is to turn to Captain America. The action comes in spurts with some very cool scenes. The mystery was intriguing the first time around since I only had a few hints as to where the story was going. The major twist of Hydra infiltrating Shield took me totally off guard. I thought Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce was a pretty cool villain of sorts contributing to the overall force of the twist. Chris Evans looks more comfortable in the lead role and the special effects looked a lot better. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.comSuperb continuation of Captain America Captain America strikes back in this sequel to the 2011 box office hit that bridges a continuation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a sequel that not only boasts some of the best action sequences and heavy special effects of recent memory but also improve upon its predecessor. Expanding the character development and a more charged plot, Winter Soldier takes just about everything from the original and cranks them up to the next level. Chris Evans reprises his role as Steve Rogers who now works side-by-side for S.H.I.E.L.D with Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow (played by Scarlett Johansson) but has difficulty adjusting to the modern world as Captain America when dealing with powerful threats and moral obligations. Worse, he discovers SHIELD is being threatened by a terrorist group known as Hydra and the threat becomes real when SHIELD director Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is attacked and mortally wounded when Steve a visit at his apartment. With fingers pointed at him and his trust put to the test Steve, Natasha, and his trusted friend Sam Wilson a.k.a Falcon (played by Anthony Mackie) must fight against tyrant group while facing against questionable figures he once trusted.  It's difficult not see how well and what this film improves upon the first film. While the first one is highly entertaining and brought upon some likable characters and a plot keep it moving, this one digs deeper into the character arc and plot development while leaving room for fantastic special effects and pulse-pounding action. Chris Evan returns in the titular role and is more likable than ever before. Granted by a more three-dimensional development and a slight taste of humor, Evans strives in this role and displays his most charismatic performance ever put to screen. Scarlett Johansson is no exception. She stands well as Steve Roger/Captain America's trusted sidekick Black Widow and much of the appeal she brought to 'The Avengers' but with much more substance. Anthony is also quite entertains in his supporting role, and someone who viewers come to like. These actors appear to have fun as their characters and the chemistry results in a trio that audience can't help but care. If there is any surprise, it may come from Robert Redford playing a SHIELD agent, a role much different than what many audience are used to seeing him in.  The first film boasted a great introduction of our titular hero in a plot that generated plenty of fun and endearment, but the plot comes much more engrossed. As the plot centers around the main character facing off against an evil terrorist called Hydra which some may find familiar from the comics as the forces that brutally hunt down our heroes, it presents a more violent and darker tone but nonetheless a deeper atmosphere. Throughout the story, the characters are taken into deeper roots and surprises and with such an inspiring screenplay, it all works. Not to say it goes in the realm of flawlessness but is moves far enough to where it's flaws will come easily unnoticed. Along with the powerful plot development comes some of exciting, adrenaline-field action sequences complete with amazing stunt work and special effects too difficult not to appreciate. One scene in particular takes place with Captain America in an elevator that comes with quite a surprise, and in the end easily one of the most memorable scenes in the film. The action sequences do dominate much of the second half but what makes exciting other than the inspiring special effects is they never feel repetitive. As a result, they remain eye-catchers to the audience. Captain America: Winter Soldier is a great example of a sequel that manages to dig deeper upon its original outing, and thanks by the strong direction by Anthony and Joe Russo it's fun to watch and serves as a solid addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is very entertaining and will have viewers, particularly Marvel fans pumped for the next film Captain America: Civil War which I am genuinely excited about.Manages to Be Better Than the First Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)  *** (out of 4)  Captain America (Chris Evans) is still trying to come to terms with who and what he is but now he must face someone he remembers from his past. It seems the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is the strongest creation and it's up to members of SHIELD to try and stop him as well as a criminal (Robert Redford) wanting to cause mass destruction. CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER is a rare sequel that actually manages to be better than the original film. That's not to say the first film wasn't good but this one here pretty much adds a lot of steroids to the action and makes for an overall much better film. The cast is certainly in top form and directors Anthony and Joe Russo certainly know how to milk an action scene for everything that it's worth. There's no question that the highlights of the movie are the extended action scenes that features some terrific looking CGI that perfectly mixes in with the live action on the screen. It's really amazing to see how far technology has come over the past decade and this film certainly looks tremendous. The action scenes contain so much chaos and destruction that it's really a wonder that this stuff can be pulled off. There's one great action sequence after another and this here certainly makes the film. Evans is obviously quite comfortable in his role as Captain America and he's perfectly able to bring the human element that the story needs. The supporting cast is equally good with Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson and Anthony Mackie all doing nice work. Stan is also extremely good in his role as the villain and when you've got someone like Robert Redford it just brings your film to another level. CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER is a fun, fast and over-the-top summer movie that actually delivers a good time.Good Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a well-done film, I just don't get any personal investment out of it. Everything is well-done from the action sequences to the story but nothing holds me tight and truly grips me for me to enjoy like a lot of other people do. I definitely thought the action was really good and there were some genuinely interesting sequences but the film feels sort of...light. It's not like I can't appreciate the films efforts and there succession into crafting genuinely entertaining sequences, I just don't find it very enthralling and I don't think it deserves to be hailed as a masterful political thriller.Marvel's most impressive movie to date This movie is ultimately just a setup movie for the rest of the MCU, however that does not stop it from being a very well made and entertaining movie. Personally I was feeling tired of Captain America himself, but watching this movie again I found that he was actually a more likable, well written character. The Russo brothers did a very good job of taking an already well established character and making something much better of him - expanding his character and in doing so shaping him into a character who you will be excited to see in future movies. However the supporting cast of characters was a mixed bag. Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson both reprised their roles and if you liked them in previous movies, you'll like them here. I didn't feel we learnt much about their characters and by the end of the movie it felt like Scarlett Johansson's character was in the same place she started. However all three of the actors mentioned above gave great performances, and having seen the rest of the MCU movies I think the performances in general were some of the best in a MCU movie. The problem came in the new editions to the cast - I was disappointed to see Robert Redford given quite a bland character, who is an instant edition to the already crowded canvas of forgettable Marvel villains. The Winter Soldier himself felt like a kind of supporting villain without much of a role in the movie - definitely not a big enough role to name the movie after him. Although the final edition was perhaps the best character in the movie: Falcon. This was a surprisingly well written character wonderfully played by Anthony Mackie, who took a fairly large role in the film and was generally one of the most memorable aspects of this movie. This is the first MCU movie to be directed by the Russo brothers and by far the best directed MCU movie to date. Marvel has noticeably struggled with finding suitable and good directors to put any auteur in their movies, with previous directors such as Shane Black and Alan Taylor failing miserably. However here is a movie which not only found suitable directors but benefited greatly from them. The Russo brothers did a stunning job of portraying the tension and suspense both throughout the movie and in their juxtaposition of the the conflicting ideologies of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Steve Rogers. The Russo brothers shined in many other places, from their creation of highly emotionally resonate scenes to some of the best action in a MCU movie to date. The entire movie felt very well dealt with and made; the plot was stronger than most superhero movies and well thought out, and it did a very good job of setting up future MCU movies, in particular Captain America Civil War. In a world already crowded by an overload of superhero movies, this one is sure to stick out.Captain America returns with an incredibly gritty spy thriller. The good - Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson reprise their roles as Captain America and Black Widow with every bit of energy as their previous performances. It's great to see the more human side of Natasha (a precursor to Age of Ultron) and Evan's Cap is more than capable of making me cheer for a true hero in an anti-hero world. If nothing else, you believe that people would line up behind him to fight. The great - Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson (Falcon) is the heart, humor and humility of this film. He is a fantastic addition to the MCU and I bought his relationship with the Cap from the first moment. Being a big fan of the Cap and Falcon books as a kid, I felt this struck the exact right tone. I expect great things from the character going forward. The awesome - I love the third act of this movie. The assault on the Triskelion, Cap's speech to S.H.I.E.L.D., the final battle with The Winter Soldier, Widow's twist...it all worked for me. One of the best third acts in a series that has always excelled in them. Something should also be said for the close combat fight choreography in the film. The elevator fight got my vote for best fight scene in all the MCU in a recent poll and some of the hand to hand knife work is simply outstanding. The darkness - Following on the "dark" tone of Thor: The Dark World, the Russo brothers give us a spy thriller, wrapped inside of a comic movie, and I am not entirely sure it always works. The first act is rather disjointed, and a bit hard to follow (even after watching it a few times). The second act is a bit slow for me and while I loved Arnim Zola, I wanted him to stick around. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't take off until the third act, and, by that time, the spy thriller is pretty much over. Summary - If I stopped watching this movie midway it would score much lower than it will. The third act pays off tremendously, and makes this one of the better MCU films. I don't get the absolute love this movie gets from many Marvel CU fans, as many feel it is the best of them. I certainly don't get that, but I think it might have to do a lot with the whole "dark and gritty" thing, exemplified by the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. I have a hunch that they also think The Dark Knight is a best comic book movie of all time, and while it is a decent answer, it is still wrong...that honor belongs to Iron Man. :) Bottom line, for me, is that I love the lighter tone of (most) of the rest of the MCU, and while I enjoyed Captain America: The Winter Soldier (particularly the last act), it falls just short of the original.Captain America: The Winter Soldier "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" has probably the most intense and exciting action scenes of any marvel movie. In fact, I feel like the movie as a whole has more in common with a "Bourne Identity" movie than a superhero movie. This is largely do to the way these scenes were shot, edited, and choreography. The scenes are almost always shot in a wide angle, showing each full hit. While there are many cuts, I realized that again they almost never cut on a hit, which lessens the impact of the hit so it seems much less visceral. Also, again, while there are many cuts, the action is always kept in the center of the frame, so the viewer's eyes aren't jumping all over the frame every second, trying to figure out what is going on. Finally, the character always starts at a disadvantage at the beginning of a fight scene and has to fight his way back up (particularly in one of my favorite scenes, the elevator fight). I know these may seem like very subtle touches, but they add up to make some incredibly visceral fight scenes. And those are definitely the best parts of the movie. The fight scenes. Don't get me wrong, nothing else is really bad, per se. The main characters are rather well rounded (for a superhero movie that is), and they all follow similar character arcs (they all learn to be able to trust in people again, while also learning that maybe everything is not quite what it seems). There's also some political commentary, but it's very surface level stuff. Basically it tries to tell us that, while technology becomes better and better, the government will be able to develop more powerful weapons. And the government themselves could actually be apart of some Nazi party and we could be entirely oblivious as to everything they believe in and the power that they hold. Of course this sounds ridiculously over the top, and that's because it absolutely is. Hell, I even found myself laughing out loud at some of the crazier moments in the plot. So obviously it didn't exactly portray the message that I thought it was going for very well, unless it was going for satire, which I'm 99% sure it wasn't. But nonetheless, it was a very entertaining movie, with pretty good dialogue (although some obligatory cheesy superhero movie lines), well written characters, great action, and a little bit of political commentary delivered in a very over the top fashion. So I'd say it fulfilled it's purpose, and even went a bit farther than that.Best Marvel movie Captain America: The Winter Soldier  This is the best Marvel superhero film, at least my personal favorite. It is better than the first entry of this super hero character, Captain America: The First Avenger. Where to begin? There is the political intrigue since the start of the film. Who is the bad guy? Is Nick Fury corrupt? All these questions get answered eventually as the film develops from a start that exposes a state in which everything is under control and serene into chaos and gun fights. Redford is giving an important role in this film. SHIELD is compromised since the start. You cannot trust anyone, Captain America learned this right away. Also it is worth the mention of the Captain's old flame, Peggy is still alive and she is quite sick, she has aged 70 years and she remembers Rogers. It get emotional as it had been a long time since World War II where their story had been so tragically separated from each other. Rogers needed to see her after all these years and Peggy seemed genuinely sad and hurt due of the distance in time, it has been too long. Indeed it is bittersweet for both of the would be lovers of another era. The time is gone and time does not wait for anyone. Then the attacks are done against the director and the soldier. Captain America is not easy to kill and he is bulky and has super strength but he can get hurt by guns and bullets. Captain America is disavowed by SHIELD, but this organization is not what it appears. Captain America thought he had defeated the enemy Hydra and the Red Skull in the end of World War II, but his sacrifice was not an end, it appears. There a good scene when the former Hydra scientific doctor, Zola, had been given an old dated artificial intelligence because his body had failed him and his mind had been stored in this computer. Mackie is the Falcon, a man that glides in the sky with a machine with wings. It is cool to watch, but it seems a bit too fantastic. Johansson is back as Natasha Romanov and she acts accordingly. The action is great the Winter Soldier had known Steve Rogers before, they had been best friends. The winter assassin had been Bucky Barnes and all people had thought that he had died in the bridge falling off a train. But he had not died, he survived and was used by the evil doers, Hydra, to kill many leaders and people around the world. It was said that he shaped the last century. The Winter Soldier has forgotten a lot of things, his memory had been wiped clean by the shock therapy he has underwent, it is quite disturbing. In the end the bad guys want to kill people that they deemed threats in the present and the future. They have super machines that are sky bound heavy with guns to kill the people, which are millions and millions. Captain America must stop this at all cost and there is CGI action in the end, that diverts a bit the old school action of the film. An important part of the film is that it details the political struggle in today's world. How freedom and liberty are being put in jeopardy. I love the part when the Cap. says "The price of freedom is high, like it always have been, but this is a price I am willing to pay." It was a good moment in the film. This film gets emotional with Captain America trying to recover his old friend, Bucky that is oblivious to his best friend. The Winter Solider sees the Cap. as only a end of his mission. Can Rogers win back his friend? The answer of this question is not easily answered as there is a lot of things to look forward in the sequels. Well, the Winter Soldier is a great film, yes it is better than Avengers Assemble that is a bit overrated. This is the best Marvel film. I give it a 90 percent rating, 4 and half stars. Solid action, solid story, it is good film all around. Highly recommended, maybe and hopefully I can have a second viewing of this film because it deserved so.Usual clich√©s but creative and beautiful to watch It should be time to change more thoroughly the plots and the development of this kind of superhero movies like, also, those of secret agents. You see one and it's as if you've seen them all. In this case, however, the pleasant note is that the ideas around the special effects (computer graphics) are very pleasant and there are very nice action and fight scenes to watch. For the rest, the film, like all those of superheroes of the last years is extremely predictable and obvious as is as the script. A good film for a young audience mainly, fun but, nothing really new under the sun for technically savvy viewers. 8/10 because yes, it is obvious but, undoubtedly entertains and well done.One of the Best Marvel Movies to Date, Making Captain America Seem Awesome Captain America: The Winter Soldier is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and stars Chris Evans reprising the role of Captain America, along with Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, and introducing Anthony Mackie as the Falcon. This film follows Captain America and Black Widow as they are forced to run and hide from S.H.I.E.LD., once the agency spontaneously turns on them. Now, there's more than a few spoilers in this film that I won't give away, but I still want to review it. Now, in my opinion, this is one of the best Marvel movies to date. It's at least on par with Spiderman 2, Guardians of the Galaxy, and possibly even The Avengers. The whole movie's tone is not the same, fun tone that Marvel took with The Avengers, or the first Captain America movie. This whole film feels like a 70's spy, espionage movie. The film is also very dark, almost like Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. It's a complete new take on Captain America and on S.H.I.E.L.D. in general. The greatest thing about the film is how bad Steve gets the life beat out of him. He has about three allies in the world, and everybody else is convinced he's a criminal. Other great superhero movies have done the exact same; beat down the hero. This was present in Spiderman 1 and 2, Iron Man, and The Dark Knight Rises. This element makes us feel for our hero, and ultimately love it even more when they come out on top. The directing and cinematography was amazing, as well. All the wide shots of the S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, or the Triskelion, look great. The action is near perfectly directed, especially in hand to hand combat scenes. My favorite scene in this film is the fight scene on the highway between Cap and the Winter Soldier, mostly due to the action. The directing, along with the slowly rising score, make this scene as close to perfect as it gets. Now, there is an issue with this movie. And it's going to be hard to explain, because it involves a plot twist. And, not just a plot twist for this film, this twist links all the way back to the first Iron Man. So, I really don't want to spoil it for anybody that hasn't seen this movie yet. However, the twist was somewhat rushed. Yes, it was surprising, but it was thrown at the audience like a baseball. It was very rushed, and presented no evidence from the previous films in the Cinematic Universe. However, this is my only problem with the film. Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of the best Marvel movies to date. I would give it an A, or a 9 out of 10.I love this movie. This movie is great in every way - story, acting, character development, effects, cinematography, humor, drama, and action. I have no complaints for this movie and would highly recommend it. This movie is extremely well done and entertaining. I had a lot of fun watching it.A Marvel Action-Thriller Par Excellence Movie Review: "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" (2014) To this day arguably the most thrilling action-movie, coming from the "Marvel Universe" due to live-action metal-clashing street car crashing sequences in best 1980s "Die Hard" / "Lethal Weapon" manner as further fullfilling martial arts fighting scenic ingredients, when Steve Rogers aka Captain America, portrayed by actor Chris Evans in super-motivation mode under newly-acquired directions through absolute engaging director duo Anthony and Joe Russo, who own the pace, the story pointing twists surrounding mysteriously build-up character of Bucky Barnes, performed in capable action manners with highly-trained combat skills and artificial metal arm as Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Robert Redford as the character of Alexander Pierce bring further suspense-pushing conspiracy material to the screen, when in 130 minutes the emotional as gripping story arc never fails to Hollywood major budget event showdowns with giant "Helicarrier" collision in extreme wide-angle high quality shots, letting second installment of "Captain America" mark one of the highlight movies at "Marvel Studios" alongside the always amazing "Avengers" assemble venues. Copyright 2018 Cinemajesty Enterteinments LLCA sequel that ups its predecessor in every way Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the sequel to the first Captain America Movie and follows the events of The Avengers with expanding on the corporate SHIELD and the secrets they've been hiding in it for decades. And this movie is a huge improvement on the first film. The story is one of the freshest stories have come up with to date with its gritty fight sequences and twists no one can expect at all in this film, all thanks to the Russo Brothers.  With the strong direction by the Russo brothers this film gets a face lift from the first and brings the film to a modern age that it needed. Getting away from the '40's and showing a more modern Cap that's still trying to adjust to the new world he has missed since being frozen adds a lot of funny sequences and great one lines that are executed perfectly in this film. My favorite part of this film though is the fights, each scene for them feels brand new and not one feels like a copycat or a recreation of the first movie or anywhere else. And that's one of the best things with this film is the originality that the Russo brothers put into this film. And now with them directing Civil War and Infinity War. They have made a mark in Marvel as being one of the best directors yet.  The writing done by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely did a fantastic job on this script. The dialogue feels so real and fits each and every cast member perfectly with its fast jokes and memorable lines throughout. Even the minor characters that we've gotten sneak peaks at in The Avengers have made memorable parts in this film playing key points in the overall story telling. Even Chris Evan and Scarlett Johansson writing the dialogue for the scenes between them feels so natural and adds a huge comedy piece as they try to get Steve a date with anyone in his life.  The acting is once again amazing by its key cast (Evans, Johansson, Jackson) with the new faces as well killing each and every role. Especially the broken and confused Bucky/Winter Soldier played by Stan and the quick witted and perfect partner to Steve, Sam Wilson played by Anthony Mackie. And of course my favorite new performance in the film is done by the legendary Robert Redford with his offputting look and twisting dialogue that's shown throughout.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a fantastic film with a single plot hole that, yes, was explained in a deleted scene but never put into the final product is why did he go and get his old suit when he had a modern day battle ready one that was perfectly fine?  Captain America: The Winter Soldier gets a 9.5/10Fits of Fury In this film Captain America (Chris Evans) is attempting to catch up. He is losing some of the dorkiness which made him lovable. He teams up with the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) because she tested well with male audiences in the 8 to 80 age bracket. Iron Man is mentioned, but it seems the rest of the Avengers are on vacation during the struggle for humanity. This film has a decent plot (i.e. fitting bad guys for good guys) with a good mix of action and drama. It even has some light moments such as when our twosome are among some old computers and Black Widow does her 1983 "WarGames" voice and proclaims, "Shall we play a game?" Of course Captain America can't catch the humor. Great popcorn film that explodes on the screen. I enjoyed this more than the recent Thor film.Better then The First Avenger Honestly I think this one is 10X better then the first one.  We know that Bucky is alive and was programed later on to become weapon known as the Winter Soldier. The best scenes are when Cap and bucky have a fight on the road and on the landing bay at SHIELD. When Arnim Zola triggers a bomb in the lab and destroyed the building and when Steve takes the elevator but gets attacked by agents. Samuel L Jackson definitely improved as Nick Fury in this movie and it turned out that his eye patch had a tracer or boob in it I can't remember why he burned it. Overall awesome movie 10/10Captain America spy Pretty good spy movie, but it does not fit into the scale of the Marvel cinematic universe. When this happens, as in the film, Avengers should be involved.Much better than I expected, especially after the first film The first Captain America was fine, though not fantastic, and then got ruined right at the end. Given that, and having seen most of the recent superhero / comic-book movies I wasn't expecting much from this. That is was expecting all style, no substance, token plot, wooden performances, lives and dies by action scenes and special effects. Captain America: The Winter Soldier has the action scenes and special effects, but it has much more than that. Plot is fairly good. Not watertight, but moves along well, mostly makes sense, and has some character development. Performances are good. The interplay between Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson works and the supporting cast give solid performances. Overall, an entertaining movie and the best of the Marvel movies.A Yes Good A piece of art is either Good or Bad. A Yes, you would recommend it to others or a No, don't waste your timeAn excellent action/Superhero film. It's fun, but also serious and engaging enough to make I interesting for the entire runtime, with some great action sequences This was so much better than I was expecting! Sure, I liked the first Captain America film, but in reality, he's not Marvel's strongest character - just their version of Superman, but he CAN die from a bullet. However, they were smart with this one, bringing in a strong cast to back Cap up - with familiar faces Black Widow (Johansson), Nick Fury (Jackson), Maria Hill (Smulders), Jasper Sitwell (Hern√°ndez) and Senator Stern (Shandling) all in at least one of the other films or the TV show - plus Falcon (Mackie) and Senator Pierce (Redford) as the new additions. The biggest mystery - if you haven't read the comics - is who the Winter Soldier is, and it does a pretty good job of the reveal (no spoilers here!). The whole film flows on nicely from the 'The First Avenger' and 'The Avengers'. I was really happy with the pacing - it does a great job of reintroducing the familiar characters and bringing in the new ones and then there's plenty of action and great set-pieces - most on a scale I didn't believe Captain America could/would accommodate. And there's plenty of humour too, even when the characters are in dire straits. It also works well for the first 90min or so as a pretty great mystery, with plenty of curve-balls and "did that really happen?" moments. This is really fun to watch, as you get to see more of Steve Rogers as a character, rather than Captain America, the warrior. It's also nice to see Cap and Black Widow spending time together not fighting enemies - although I'm biased, because I would watch Scarlett Johansson in anything! But the best parts are still the action sequences - they've given Cap some great moves and it's just plain fun to watch him and how they've filmed it. The Stan Lee cameo/one-liner is great and links in nicely with an earlier scene and Danny Pudi from Community even gets a pretty funny scene. It's also nice to see Fury play a more pivotal role, rather than one or two small scenes. The plot gets a little absurd near the end, but it gives Cap, Black Window and Falcon a mission and sets up a huge battle in the final 20min. There's sure to be some repercussions from the events of this film. And we only have to wait two years until the next Captain America film, which is a good thing, seeing how well made this one was. As always, stay until after the end titles for a very revealing scene!a spy thriller in a superhero movie for one exciting journey Cap is back in the first movie in his series we were given the origin set in the 1940s but now with un frozen cap who comes into a world with the internet and new threats too. Chris Evens is our hero in the colors of america as he works for S.H.I.E.L.D. and is also working alongside fellow avenger black widow played by Scarlett Johansson and these two have some amazing scenes together showing their chemistry and that they make a great team they aren't the only heroes with new addition of the Falcon played by Anthony Mackie who brings the new hero to life. also in the cast is the return of the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Fury played by the amazing Samuel L. Jackson and this movie also stars Robert Redford and series return to Sebastian Stan and MCU return for Cobie Smulders. with a modern world that Steve Rodgers aka Captain america has come into he will have to save the world from a threat that he thought was long dead in one of Marvels greatest films to date and some of the greatest action set pieces that has been produced from a hero movie and the story is equals as a thriller and a hero movie with neither crossing over too much i love this one and it will be one of my favorite marvel movies that have been released.A well paced movie... This movie is very well paced, and is balanced with a well told story, and proper fight scenes. This movie brought Captain America the justice he deserved.It's easy to see why this is commonly regarded as one of the most popular MCU films to date. 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is a film that needs no introduction. What directors Joe and Anthony Russo (who, might I add, were originally known for their work on comedies before they were hired to direct this) managed to accomplish with this film is quite impressive. Simply put, they managed to give us one of the most tightly-scripted outings of the MCU with a story that pays homage to classic 70's spy thrillers while also addressing Captain America's jump from the simpler days of World War II to the morally grey ordeals of the modern world. And it's all tied to one of the MCU's greatest twists that takes the franchise in a completely new direction. The action sequences are incredible and Chris Evans, Scarlett Johannsson, and Samuel L. Jackson shine in arguably their greatest turns as Cap, Black Widow, and Nick Fury, respectively. Now with that said, admittedly I wouldn't call this one my absolute favorite MCU film to date. Still, I very much appreciate this film for everything that it did for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For one thing, it helped revitalize the franchise after the admittedly rocky year that it had in 2013 as evident from the polarizing 'Iron Man 3' and the not-so-popular 'Thor: The Dark World'. Plus, its iconic twist allowed Marvel Studios' first TV series, 'Agents of SHIELD', to finally find its groove after a rocky start. Thus, it may not be my #1 favorite, but it's certainly in the Top 5.A big win for the comic book genre Great film. Worth my time and yours. I had a lot of fun with this one, the characters are neat, Chris Evans does a great job as Captain America, the effects and fights are nice, the film goes at a very nice pace, and was overall enjoyable. In Marvel we trust, they know how to make these movies.Captain America The Winter Soldier is fun, entertaining and enjoyable action, superhero movie with breathtaking action sequences. Captain America The Winder Soldier: Movie Review. Captain America The Winter Soldier is one of the best film by Marvel. The film has very rock solid character developments and moments, superb cast characters performances,top notch quality storytelling and beautiful visual effects. Captain America The Winter Soldier is visually dazzling, political conspiracy suspenseful thriller with strong cast performances and surprising intense and intriguing storyline and plot twist. The movie looks visually stunning. The direction is amazing and Chris Evans is awesome as Captain America. Chris Evans with his charismatic charming personality and has made the character of Captain America looks great and emotionally enjoyable. Scarlett Johansson is fabulous as always. She has once again given a truly solid performance as Black Widow and Samuel L.Jackson is incredible as Nick Fury. Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier and Robert Redford as the main villains have also done a good job. The plot and story sometimes seems to be off the course and little bit rushed in the portrayals of main villains. Some CGI shots lacks realism and feels little bit overdone. All over Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a great movie and it is also one of the best movies of Marvel Studios and a great addition to Marvel Cinematic Universe. (Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You).Much better than Dark World What I liked 1. Unlike Dark world, at least this was memorable 2. Falcon had a pretty good debut film here 3. The reveal that Hydra is not dead was something that I felt was well done 4. Nick Fury's death What I didn't like 1. Nick Fury then turning out to be alive felt like a massive cop out 2. I am just not a big fan of Black Widow here 3. It is a little long Overall this film is actually pretty decent even if it does have a few minor flaws. This is by far the best phase 2 MCU film and the only phase two film that I felt like was actually worth watching at all.Just Brilliant. Winter Soldier is possibly still my favourite Marvel movie, with an engaging and engrossing story, tremendous action and a terrific cast. I loved it at the cinema and a re-watch on blue ray last night confirmed how good it is. Robert Redford in Washington - shades of All The President's Men! He may be pretty old but he just oozes class. Marvel always seem to go for high calibre actors. No exception here. The plot of course concerns Cap investigating a conspiracy within SHIELD, abetted by Black Widow with a first appearance from The Falcon. They made a great team - a sort of mini-Avengers. Sam Jackson gets a bit more to do - hurrah - and if you missed the quote on the tombstone, have another look. Fantastic little in-joke. Seb Stan is great as the tormented Soldier, putting the lie to the claim that Marvel villains are all generic. Cap's fight in the elevator is superb - as are all the fight scenes, and if one or two plot points are a bit far fetched I can forgive that easily. Doc Zola's algorithm which predicts future threats to HYDRA so they can be assassinated is a case in point. Great CBM, then. Civil War is almost as good.Review Very good movie. Story was compelling. Action sequences were crisp, well directed and well spaced to keep you on the edge of your seats. Emotional connection between Bucky and Cap was established. 5 out of 5 stars. Other directors should learn from this director on how to make a good movie.Price of freedom is high...always has been Marvel delivers is best movie yet with a film that nails it on every front. The story, writing, directing, action, effects, cast performance were all top notch. It made Cap into my new favorite character as he is no longer the boy scout we saw in the First Avenger and in the Avengers. The Russo bros. proved that they can be true leaders in the MCU and their future with this franchise is guaranteed to be great. Starting with the cast, Chris Evans proves he can be a leading man in big films. As Rogers, he showed all sides being humorous, humble, powerful and threatening. They could have made it depressing having Cap deal with being defrosted and outliving all his friends and loved ones. Having him with a list of things with watch and read was funny. Meeting with Peggy, who is still alive but with dementia, was sweet but still really heartbreaking. Johansson's Romanoff was as good as Evans and she is showed much more dimensions to her character. She showed that she wants a true friend in Cap. I love what the Russo bros said about Widow and Cap how they are work wife/work husband. As there is romantic/sexual tension between them but they trust each other enough that they know the need each other professionally. Mackie's Falcon was awesome too, as he is a new partner for Cap that showed so much swagger. He also had a great insight into being a veteran of war that meshed well with Rogers. The villains were great too. Redford's Pierce was great as a tactical leader of Hydra. He brought enough charisma into his performance that did not diminish the power he had and the brutality he delivers. Winter Soldier was also awesome as he proved to be just like Cap, and I won't reveal his true identity, but his effect against Cap, both physically and psychologically, was well acted by both Evans and Stan.  The story in this film was incredible, cohesive and thought- provoking. The idea of how freedom can be difficult to control as it is, by it's definition, independent from any control was well done as Cap adjusts to the new world. The writing, dialogue, humor was also amazing from the directors who did Arrested Development and Community and the screenwriters also created Agent Carter helped writing for other good Marvel movies. The action in this movie, especially fight choreography was simply breathtaking. The infiltration on the freighter, the elevator fight, the highway fight and the final battle, is some of the best choreography made in any action film. The effects were minimized for this film, which I really appreciate as the practical effects and stunt choreography was perfect. The helicarriers and Falcon in flight were very well done and looked so real over the Potomac river. I really don't have a complaint for this film but there are a few tiny things that bother me. Why didn't they call in the Avengers in the final scene? Iron Man was supposedly retired but Hulk still could have helped. Why are so many people in the MCU dead but not really? Does anyone stay dead? I mean there are villains but basically no heroes die. But those are very tiny things in an almost perfect superhero movie. + Cap and Widow relationship + Cast performances all around + Writing, directing, story + Impeccable action, effects and stunts - Tiny, tiny problems that you can only overthink Final Score: 9.7/10Amazing movie Captain America Winter Soldier was just an amazing film: great action packed thriller. It's undoubtedly one of the best films within the Marvel Universe along with Iron Man, but the amazing thing about Winter Soldier is that even if it wasn't a superhero movie, it will still be a really amazing movie, and one of the best action-spy-thrillers of all time. The amazing thing about Captain America is that all its films besides the Winter Soldier are amazing in their own right; the same cannot be said with all of the other superhero movies within the Marvel Universe. The story was interesting (brings you closer), and though it's called the "Winter Soldier", that character didn't really get much of a screen time. Unlike most of the other films within the Marvel Universe, Winter Soldier is one of those films you would see AGAIN &amp; AGAIN!!! it was entertaining. The movie looked serious too.reviewers Looks like most the reviewers here either loved this movie or really hated it (The haters being highly outnumbered). And the reasons the haters hate it are...well let's just say...pathetic. Apparently some people don't understand the difference between good and evil, while others find the little things to nitpick at, like the bad guys not shooting at Cap's feet when he's running at them with his shield.Steve+Nat=win) The only complain about this movie is that action scenes are too quick. Shaking camera and too much happening in seconds makes it hard to follow..apart from that it is a...Marvellous Movie)))  Streve Rodgers was not my favorite character from Avengers, until I watched this) I was always into Scarlett) Here... this is what they call an ideal action movie)) with impressive action scenes and usual Avengers stuff - the meaning and the message behind the action.  So..to put it simply - this is the best Avengers action movie and probably the best action movie of 2010s)) The joyride of watching this.. and two hours swishing like 15 minutes)) Battle music, Steve being the knight of the world and Scarlett breaking me heart again that I do not have such a marvel in me life)) this is what an action movie is all about)) P.S. There is a lot of praise to dramatic performance of actors in drama movies.. but still.. here.. to look so convincing in every second of action scenes like Chris and Scarlett did.. requires no less talent))review A fantastic action packed thrill ride. The cast do an amazing job as their characters. The story grabbed my attention. The film moves along at a good pace, it kept me interested from beginning to end. The action is very good. It could be the best superhero film ever made, or one of them. I really enjoyed it.A Captain America movie that focuses equally on his future side-kick Winter Soldier This movie manages to stay out of superhero clich√©s and manages to be a realistic and logical action- thriller. Intro part is very attracting and casting Georges St-Pierre, one of the best MMA fighters ever, as Batroc is a very good choice. Hand-to-hand combat scenes and highway combat scenes are realistic and professional. The movie touches the theme of freedom, which is what Captain America stands for, elegantly.Marvel continues to ride high after the success of Avengers Assemble THE WINTER SOLDIER is a far superior sequel to the original Captain America: unlike the first film, this doesn't descend into a CGI mess in the second half, and instead remains tight and compelling right up to and throughout the climax. This one has a retro, '70s political thriller-type feel going on, with Chris Evans cast as a friendless figure out of his time and out of his depth, at the mercy of sinister and unknown forces. It's a decent film too, one never less than entertaining, and the second-best Marvel film I've seen, right behind AVENGERS ASSEMBLE (which had the huge budget and scale as a result). The fast-paced narrative includes all manner of martial arts-based fight scenes which, although reliant on CGI, are still exciting to watch. The elevator sequence is a real highlight and expertly staged. The effects are generally above average and the humour and camaraderie that these films are known for are both present. Scarlett Johansson shines here and Samuel L. Jackson gets more depth than usual, while Robert Redford is fun in a stock role. I wouldn't call THE WINTER SOLDIER a masterpiece, but it certainly does the job well enough and never disappoints.Then finish it. 'Cause I'm with you 'til the end of the line. When viewed in the context on the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe and the superhero genre itself, it's easy to see that the Captain America films are some of the best. The first one was a authentic war period piece from the 1940's, and now The Russo's Brothers, with their low filmmaking experience, take what the first set up and expand it to make a phenomenally film know as Captain America: The Winter Soldier. This was always my favorite one. Even when I had seen it in theaters back in 2014 I knew that this was the one I was waiting for. Not only did The Russo Brothers improve on the first but decided to make a spy thriller instead of a superhero film. That's what I think makes the film itself so good, it's ability to be a superhero film second. Their idea to make it a primary espionage film is spectacular. Both directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, The Winter Soldier is a marvel to see on screen. Their slick and darkish tone with the character of Captain America coincide perfectly. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and the visuals are brilliant. The action is shot perfectly with well choreographed fights and great editing. Along side a menacing and unique score the film is boosted up to the sky with it's technical aspects. Bringing his own flare and charismatic genius once again, Chris Evans is awesome as Captain America. He is so energetic and just feels so real. The casting is something Marvel Studios I feel always gets right. Scarlett Johansson was a great addition for Captain America as she brings her usual great moves and her spy like demeanor. Anthony Mackie, Robert Redford, Sebastian Stan, all these great actors giving their all in roles simply *made* for them. I couldn't see anyone else in their roles and their chemistry is fantastic. Some may see my rating as a bit too high, but to me it's perfect. The Avengers may be their best film but, this is my *favorite* MCU film. That's saying a lot, because I watch these films so much I lost count, I've probably seen this at least ten times. What Anthony and Joe Russo did with this and really the entire superhero genre is stunning, taking an interesting character and bringing in an unfamiliar genre to add was pure brilliance. In short, Captain America: The Winter Solider is top tier God level filmmaking and one of my favorite superhero films of all time.Not great. i thought Iron Man was excellent and hoped the Marvel movies would see Iron Man as the standard to be reached but then we had the dreadful Iron Man 2 and the even worse third effort. Now with Capt i thought the first movie was OK, one of the better Marvel movies, not great but OK, so i went along with my son hoping for something better. My few complaints are: for children it wasn't great. Like Iron Man 3 he spends little time dressed at Capt. Mind numbing action sequence or falling, look he's falling again. The Hawk guy - where did he come from? he was a rubbish character Scarlett - look here's a shot of capt looking through her legs, look here's her boob side on, etc maybe I'm an old fart but the eye candy shots left me bored to tears. Im sure teenagers will get more from it.Great - Just Not Memorable "The price of freedom is high... and it's a price I'm willing to pay! You told me not trust anyone and this is how it ends: EVERYTHING goes!" ‚Äì Captain America Another Marvel Studios film has been released. This time it is starring the masked superhero with a huge shield and big muscles to go with it. You guessed it: Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The story starts off with Captain America, played by Chris Evans, leading a team of SHIELD Agents to help get back their hijacked ships from Algiers pirates. They successfully get back the ship with butt- kicking action, but Steve Rogers aka Captain America gets suspicious when Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) or better called as The Black Widow does another mission of protecting SHIELD's data. Furious, Captain America starts to question the loyalty and honesty behind SHIELD industries to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson).  Nick Fury, being a secretive badass, answers that SHIELD is just like any industry. They have missions to fulfill and no time to waste. All of which is to maintain the industry's target to protect families from future terrorists attacks. However, the rest of the film reveals that SHIELD is a dirty industry ‚Äì the one that audience might not expect. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is fun superhero movie with very stylish effects. The movie package really highlights the heart-pumping action scenes. Not to mention, it's funny on right spots.  Audience without any comic background would be shocked at some of the surprising events. It will lead to many speculations on who really are the good guys and the bad guys, because anything is possible in Winter Soldier. Although it can be referred that this effect is to get the audience interested, it does not successfully fulfill that target.  Somehow, it felt like watching a soap opera, as some events in Winter Soldier are similar to plots of soap operas. (Mainly because a dead character is revived and a friend turns out to be a backstabber, like what most soap operas show) The actors involved are big stars of Hollywood (Chris Evans, Samual L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson). It pays off though, as they played very well in the film. Chris Evans played well as the ultimate American hero, and his charm makes up for any flaw that he has. Samual L. Jackson also did his part well. Although we don't see a lot of him, his role as Nick Fury was enjoyable. His part was exceptionally badass with some laughable parts. However, Scarlett Johansson's role as Black Widow was excellent. She played a very powerful and intelligent character, all of which is packaged with her sexiness. It's her being very natural that made her a favorite among other actors. For the most part, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is highly entertaining ‚Äì a movie full of wit and packed with action.  If you are a fan of marvel comics and marvel films, it is highly recommended that you watch Captain America: The Winter Soldier.  However, if you are looking for something more than pure entertainment and fun, don't waste your time going to the cinemas. It just won't hit a memorable spot. 7/10Formulaic Formulaic, boring. I wasn't compelled to care about the characters or the story. Interesting moral dilemmas always ended in the clich√©d sentimental choice. For example, the climax, Capt throwing away his shield and most probably his life for his "friendship." I would expect Capt America to be intensely responsible for his life, for he has the potential to save millions or billions of people many times over. His choice was illogical and irresponsible to the larger context of his life and humanity. The way his character is morally structured, it didn't make sense. I'm always baffled by these superheroes/saviors/good guys who are chased around and have no problem causing mass destruction and loss of life. Unless their mindset is to survive for the good of the many vs the few, although that mindset doesn't see coherence through the movie. Just another stupid movie, in my opinion.Action, explosions and conspiracy. Captain America: The Winter Soldier. We have been on a very exciting journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe over the past 6 years and with phase 2 being over half way through, we are blessed with another film in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The end of Thor: The Dark World really left the door open for Guardians of the Galalxy (Phase 2) and Avengers 3 (Phase 3) with no real clues into Avengers: Age of Ultron, so this is the last film building up to the eagerly anticipated Avengers sequel. Marvel really did it again. My expectations were stacked pretty high for this film after their track record, with Captain America The First Avenger being such an excellent film. I get mixed feelings from people when it comes to Captain America, some say they can't relate to him being "too patriotic" and others like me appreciate everything he brings to the Marvel universe. He really defines super hero being more than just a costume and a shield; Steve Rodgers has shown commitment and determination to benefit others and this is never forgotten throughout these films. It was always going to be interesting to see how Steve adapts to the 21st century after being frozen for so long only getting a glimpse of that in the Avengers. This was one of the most intriguing aspects of the film as we visit his past memories on numerous occasions, allowing us to fill in the gaps. Chris Evans is a very convincing Steve Rodgers bringing a lot to the character keeping up his brave, intelligent soldier role and making it very consistent. Each character had the chance to really develop in this film: Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is a fine example of this, there is a lot more to her than meets the eye and this film really reveals more of her espionage ways. It would be great to see her in a solo movie revealing more of her past, but this may be on hold for now if it was ever in the pipeline. Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) also really comes to life in this film, we have only met the tip of the ice burg with him so far and there's more to him than meets the eye(patch). The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) plays a very interesting role and was always going to do with his former life as Buck Barnes. The Marvel universe is forever expanding and the introduction of new characters just means more excellence. Samuel Wilson (The Falcon) (Anthony Mackie)was a very clever addition to the film, he had cap's back and brought something extra. I am all for expanding the Avengers roster and seeing the characters come to life in the MCU. Secrecy plays a massive role in this film and all is unravelled, leaving a lot to be answered. There is so much to be expanded upon and there are plenty of moments for die hard fans to get excited about. Don't let your guard down if you want to absorb everything or just enjoy it and watching again, and again and again, because you will want to. Full of action, explosions and conspiracy, this was an excellent film. Expectations are always high when it comes to Marvel films and they never fail to be blown out of the water, words don't really do this film justice. A MUST SEE! P.s. Don't forget to watch the mid and end credit scenes!!! 10/10 http://wp.me/p3pevh-LxCraptain American't believe I lost 134 min of my life to this movie ..But really, what did I expect. During some of the scenes I wanted to have Nick Fury's eye-patch on...but on both eyes. I don't expect movie adaptations of comic books to be art house cinema. But, I wish the directors etc. of these movies would make up their mind and either: a. make them serious (ie. watchmen, Christopher Nolan Batman etc). or b. camp. It's hard to watch a movie that seems to be trying to take itself seriously. When the one liners and goofiness make you feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger was gonna come on screen and be all "Allow me to break the ice. My name is Freeze. Learn it well. For it's the chilling sound of your doom!!".Surprisingly Brilliant!!! Having found the first Captain America incredibly underwhelming and by far the weakest of the initial Marvel Avengers films I went into the film with low expectations... but WOW! I was blown away.  An outstanding film across the board! The special effects were just as brilliant as they were for other Marvel films and added completely to the whole immersive feel of the film.  The Storyline was for me the best part of the film. A MASSIVE improvement on the first Captain America and really drew you in. A story that completely drew you in, taking you on an emotional roller coaster with some shocking twists and turns throughout. The plot wasn't just an explosive action thriller but quite a good political thriller too making you question who's the good guys and who's the bad ones. The ending was superb too and the cast were brilliant! Excellent support cast. An overall excellent film and one of the best stand alone Marvel films yet. 10/10 and I would definitely recommend.Great movie!!! My expectations was not huge for this second part of Captain America, but I was fascinated. The story was great and the film was made perfectly. I am a fan of MARVELS and watched all films that are released. In my opinion the best films that have been made in the series of Marvel come first: "Captain America: The Winter Soldier", followed by "The Avengers" and "Iron Man 3". Now I'm looking forward to come "The Avengers 2" and of course next year "Captain America: Civil Var". I believe that certainly both films will be a great spectacle and strongly recommend to anyone who has not seen the films of Marvel to do this. You will not regret!!!Best Marvel flick yet! I went and saw 'Captain America' at the cinema today. An early screening at 9am, reason being it was the only session showing 2d, not a fan of 3d. I was a huge fan of 'Captain America: The First Avenger', unlike most. Therefore I may be biased in my review, but i think Winter Solider is the best Marvel/Comic movie period , well apart from 'The Avengers' &amp; The Dark Knight'. I know that's a bold statement, but its my opinion and i stand by it. I mentioned before, that I didn't enjoy 'Iron Man' 2 or 3 and especially 'Thor 2' and hated 'Man of Steel' with a passion. I can say its the first time in a very long time, that i walked out of a movie, totally satisfied in every way, when it comes to a popcorn flick, it ticked all the boxes. The theme has an uneasy mood of a 1970s paranoia thriller, which i loved,chock-full of the breathless cliffhangers dictated by the genre, but equally rich in the quiet, tender character moments that made the first film unique among recent Marvel fare. The title along is misleading, firstly Winter Solider only makes a cameo and Captain America's is def the straight man in this flick, surrounded by such a diverse ensemble cast in the same vain as 'The Avengers'. With Nick Fury, Black Widow and others characters getting their fair share of screen time. It should have been rather be called 'S.H.I.E.L.D: Retaliation'. Its like them calling the 'The Avengers' movie, 'Iron Man: Avengers Assemble', as Tony Stark kind of played the central role in it. But we mustn't forget it was an ensemble cast, just as much as Captain America: Winter Solider is. Watch it for yourself and enjoy."Cap showcases his Badass avatar in full glory" Synopsis: Steve Rogers struggles to embrace his role in the modern world and battles a new threat from old history: the Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier.  Performance: Everyone nails their respective roles...with Chris Evans giving us the best "Steve Roger" portrayal till date.  Pros: Everything is awesome.  Cons: I doubt any, besides little bit of shaky cam usage.  Best moments: The Elevator sequence and all the Brutal Captain America - Winter Soldier showdowns.  'CaptainAmerica: The Winter Soldier' has the feel of a political thriller,yet delivers all the excitement of a mainstream action- adventure, aided by a good script, neat screenplay and just about right wittiness. And yeah, the action scenes are really awesome. All thanks to the Russo Brother's for giving us the "BADASS" Captain America movie we wanted to see. Already excited for what they have in store for Captain America 3. Verdict: "Awesome"  Note: Stay till the end credits(off course, since its a Marvel movie).  AND, I WANT THAT CAPTAIN America's SHIELD, ITS SO COOOL...!!!Captain America: More than just a "Shield" Captain America: Winter Solider goes way beyond my expectations! This movie is all about Captain America aka Steve Rogers fitting into the "new world". There is a reason why the Captain is the first Avenger. Even with incredible technological advances in the modern world, we find that the "outdated" Rogers is still the best soldier and leader. Although there is no doubt about his fighting prowess, there is the simple problem of living day to day. He is a soldier and what should a solider do when the war is over? We soon find threats are all around and he must decide who he can trust. I believe this is one of the best Marvel movies because of the story. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time! There was the mystery with the Winter Soldier and you really didn't know what to expect. Of course there was plenty of action, but there was also a sincere depth we have not seen in other Marvel movies.  We discover more of who Captain America is beyond patriotic, loyal, and good morals. I loved hearing about his past. Black Widow and Falcon play fantastic roles in helping us understand Rogers. Each bring their own story which allows Steve to open up. I loved the script and never felt at any time during the movie that it was slow or dull. The only issue I have is the lack of the winter soldier. I wish he would've played a bigger role besides crashing the party during action scenes. The main conflict is dealing with future threats which mean less freedom. I see the conversation between Nick Fury and Captain summing up perfectly: Nick Fury: "We're gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen." Captain America: "I thought the punishment usually came after the crime." The setting is Washington D.C. with city landscapes and underground facilities. The costumes were awesome! You can completely tell characters apart by their apparel. Captain America has a new darker uniform making him look modern, Black Widow is well... all in black, and of course we have Falcon who is very fly. Let us not forget Nick Fury with the pirate patch. Of course it is easy to talk about the good guys, but the Winter Solider I believe takes 1st place for bringing chaos and grit to this movie. A guy with a metal arm¬Ö seems like Captain America finally has a formidable enemy.  I loved the action scenes mainly becomes the camera angles. They were very close up and made the action seem that much faster. The music matched each scene wonderfully. Most of these scenes take place during the day so lighting was well done. I cannot wait for future Marvel films.The most exciting super heroes movie since Dark Knight From beginning to end is full of action packed and great camera shots of fights. Adding Robert Redford to the movie as a stunning villain, was a smart move, as he takes the whole movie to a different point from an actors performance point of view. He plays a smart and frightening role in a brilliant way. Even if some of the characters miss the depth of the likes of Dark Knight it is still a brilliant movie that you should give a try. Now and since the movie is a hit worldwide, surpassing the first one in gross revenues and setting a new April record lets hope they keep the good work with the (hinted) upcoming Avengers movie and put both Anthony Russo, Joe Russo and Joss Whedon as consultants.A Little Disappointment Well, Where to start? I loved Falcon, Cap and Winter Soldier. Next episode of this movie will a blast. First thing that annoyed me is that S.H.E.I.L.D who created the Avengers to compete and fight for New York in Avengers all of sudden is nothing but working for Hydra.For all those years Hydra was in it and they done nothing. This was so difficult for me to not believe in S.H.E.I.L.D. Hope i didn't understand the movie so i'm gonna watch it again.Falcon was great and but he and Natasha had some little role in the movie.Winter Soldier was good but story line for him was not enough to satisfy me. Overall action was very nice but story was little weak.Acting was great. This is my personal opinion. No offense to any one.The Winter Solider is Amazing!!! Working for a spy agency is tough work, being a time displaced man from the 1940's working for a spy agency is near impossible. Captain America: The Winter Solider takes place in a world after the Chitauri invasion of New York and after the events of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is now working for SHIELD alongside Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Agent Rumlow (Frank Grillo) as part of the Strike team. The Strike Team was on a mission to re capture a secret SHIELD ship captured by Batroc the Leaper (George St.Pierre). Rogers during the mission with Widow, discovers that she has another secret mission from Nick Fury(Samuel L Jackson) to extract data from the ship's computer. Cap growing tired of SHIELD's secrecy and the 'punish those before they punish you' attitude confronts Fury about the mission and about the secretive Project: Insight. Fury explains that Insight takes 3 high-tech Hellicarriers and links them to spy satellites to take out threats before they arrive. Cap leaves upset and Fury goes to decrypt the data Romanoff retrieved and finds that he can't. Concerned Fury goes to his friend and senior official for SHIELD Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) to hold off Insights debut until he can investigate his concerns a little longer. Pierce agrees and tells Fury to let him know what he finds. As Fury travels to meet his #2 Deputy Commander Maria Hill (Colbie Smulders) he is attacked by soldiers dressed as cops. Fury attempts to get off the grid but runs into the assassin know as the Winter Solider (Sebastian Stan). The Winter Solider is an awesome movie. The plot is great, writers Christopher Markus and Steven McFeely do a great job making the plot not to overly complicated but still maintain intelligence. This film takes elements of Jonathan Hickman's Secret Warriors and combines them with Ed Brubaker's Winter Solider story from his Captain America run. Director's Joe and Anthony Russo made the story feel like it the comic book came to life. The action, special effects and sound were all top- notch. I did have one major beef with the movie and that was the lack of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). As an Agent of SHIELD and frequently Black Widow's partner he should have played at least a small role in this film. However the inclusion of Falcon (Anthony Mackie) made the film that much better. I love how Falcon's and Cap's relationship grows through the film. It wasn't too forced and that Falcon was more than just the token black guy mouth of the team. In the end I think The Winter Solider set the bar pretty high for Marvel cinematic movies surpassing even The Avengers in quality. It is definitely a must see film on any format but I prefer IMAX 3D.absolutely great First of all i was confused of the title, because i did not know what 'Winter soldier' stands for. Than when i watched trailers and movie i realized that the title is great. Winter soldier is a great surprise, i love surprises and i loved Bucky. The length, the direction and the music is awesome. Especially when the winter soldier is coming in the cadre. It is just incredible how i loved it all, especially when they are all funny and witty... thats just why 'CA;WS' is superb. I can not compare any previous movie of Thor and Ironman to that of Captain America. It has completely different aura and atmosphere. And thats the best part, it really follows all other stories of Thor, Ironman, Avengers, and of course Captain America first Avenger. Also it inspires me and my work, i am an artist and enjoy all the films even more, because i can use parts of colors and toys they all have to fight with, i can interpret heroes in my own way and play. i really recommend to enjoy this film while watching! Chris Evans and Scarlet Johannson are just great actors and all others of course. Wish for more young and new actors, did not like Robert Redford in the film. But i am glad his role is finished with this movie. :) loved it, enjoyed it and am looking FW to the third part.... it is really the best Marvel movie i have ever seen.I saw it last night - it was damn near perfect! CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER" - 10 out of 10 - EXCELLENT!!! CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER" - 10 out of 10 - EXCELLENT!!!  A thrill a minute roller coaster ride, easily the best MARVEL MOVIE outside of THE AVENGERS, and technically speaking and story-wise at least, even better than that....... In my personal opinion this is my favorite singular marvel film.... I jumped a lil bit haha.. indeed the BEST MOVIE ever! A must watch! I'll never get tired of watching you CAP! .. Captain America Rocks. BEST ACTION MOVIE OF THE YEAR. : Loved it! It's so good &amp; Captain America has just become my favorite superhero. Can't wait for part 3.. Excellent movie! Lots of action, plot twists, and Marvel world building- --what's not to like... Makes me wish the avengers 2 was coming out sooner, want more of captain America and the others, capt and black widow are epic fighters!!! Great way to intro Falcon. The whole theater clapped when the falcon came out. Fantastic movie! Do not hesitate. Go see it. Its packed with action from the beginning to the end. 10 out of 10....my favorite stand alone marvel movie, amazing performances from the cast...top notch all around!Better than first part This part was best and better than first part. I would like to see third part with enemies from another country. I will get sick of Hydra if they use same name in 3rd part. Overall Chris made a great symmetry and looks perfect for super hero. Movie is worth watching no major CGI or virtual displays used like in Iron man. The CGI was very limited and gave a good twisted here and there. Looking forward for great story and less CGI in 3rd part with more characters and continue to keep that serious look in Cap. I wonder if they would get more side kicks in next part. I'm really excited for the next one.Marvel Do The Kind Of Expected Marvel Studios continue their extravagant adventure in their 'Avengers Universe' with the second Captain America film, the third to feature the titular hero and the 9th to be set in this particular Marvel universe (until a future film merges all of them together). The material put forward by Marvel in the follow up of the Avengers film have been unfortunately a little stale, with Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World both coming off slightly dull in comparison to their previous amalgamation. Captain America has however struck a strong chord with some British cinema viewers as well as reviewers, others dispute the claims that this is 'the best Marvel film so far'. The film is unchallenging in any degree. The formula of action set- pieces, cool quips and a quick dip in the pool of emotion rarely fails Marvel and is frequented in their films but after the extravagance of the Avengers the mark still has not quite been hit. The Winter Solider is indisputably the better of the post-Avengers films but still comes off fairly dull when mounted with the high expectations one has over Marvel films, an expectation slowly being shown the light of reality. The lack of many high-scope set pieces does allow some breathing room for the cast but the consistent running and gunning does water down any emotional bond toward the cast. The running and gunning however is done exceptionally well, Capt. himself ten times more active than in his previous run in and moves away from the star spangled banner into a tighter, more cutting edge stealth beating up machine. The large set pieces are great to watch when they do arrive, the slightly larger ones could benefit with a bit more 'realism' instead of looking like a port from a video game. Though criticism can be subjective, none can ignore the matter of The Winter Soldier himself. Everyone knows who he really is, it's no disguise. But in the film he's barely a lead role, he's the equivalent of Oddjob to Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce (who does provide a good antithesis). The Winter Soldier however should have been the forefront of the film, instead what was displayed was a culturally relevant plot- line with a cool villain. The plot-lines focus on pre-emptive justice and worldwide surveillance, peace through fear, is something of relevance in our era, especially during these post-Snowden months. The resulting story comes off with a moderate sigh, the aim too ridiculously imbalanced and no daringness in the continuity. And as aforementioned, where was The Winter Soldier.  A redeeming factor of the sub-titular character is however his music, the scream that plays when he enters a scene or commits an act really helps make the character seem darker. The end result ended up almost unnecessary for his involvement. That being said it's a popcorn flick and it's entertaining whilst providing a dip into the Marvel universe again before Guardians of the Galaxy. If The Winter Soldier is anything to go on it will be explosions and quips. There's nothing wrong with this, James Bond did it for 40 years. It's keeping it fresh though and if Marvel want to continue their legacy they need to quicken their pace before the hype before the next sequel is equivalent to the visit from estranged family members you'd rather ignore. Credit is due for being an entertaining film for the most part, as well as having a relevant plot-line. The Marvel universe needs an ounce of freshness however, perhaps a deviation from the ever repeating formula in favour of a more striking, surprising and emotionally engaging story.Thriller, Patriotic but overly exaggerated plot ! This feature is total bad-ass if you want action, thrill and drama, but the core of the movie "Project Insight" was little to unbelievable if you think practically. I mean those helicarriers has capacity to kill millions of people at a time by freaking bullets. Think about it for a second. And The Winter Soldier, He was a pure killing machine, there is no doubt about it. Powerful warrior. Fast. Ruthless. And Cap, He is not a superhero, he is a super soldier. He has given everything for his country, a real patriot. His mentality might be old but he sees the world as it is and he tries to stop everyone from betraying his own country. His acting is OK as Steve Rogers but as a Captain America (In Action) did the ultimate job.  The movie was worth watching in 3D. Sound fx were good. Not happy with organic animation though, like the shot where Falcon gives Cap'n a drop on the helicarrier and the shot where Falcon and Rumlow are running inside the building on 41st floor because one helicarrier is right behind them crushing the building. But VFX were good, vehicle design were good, screenplay was nice, cinematography was one of the best part of the feature and timing of action sequences were pretty cool. Overall, it was "time well spent" movie, they tried their best to make a good action movie and as long as I can see, They came close to their goal.Vaughn's ode to the spy genre KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE  Lets say there is an old recipe and we want to try something different to taste it even better. So, it is important to mix the right ingredients in the recipe to make its taste exquisite. The same goes for the movie here. But in this case the director hits the right spot in terms of mixing the ingredients and the result is also very tasteful. Kingsman tells a story of a young boy Eggsy who is extra ordinarily brilliant in everything but is withdrawn because of his personal problems. He is recruited in Kingsman secret organization by Harry Hart (Colin Firth) who is in fact a brilliant agent and 17 years ago owed his life to Eggsy's father. Eggsy plays an vital role to track down and destroy the eccentric millionaire Richard Valentine (Samuel Jackson) who is very keen to wipe out the worlds population. We may have heard this kind of plot many times before. But Mathew Vaughn does an incredible job in bringing freshness in the movie. It is very stylishly filmed with witty dialog and a good script with constant twists which will keep audiences to the edge of their seats. One notable thing is that the action sequences in this film are very different compared to other action movies. The camera work during the action scenes is remarkable. For instance, there is a 10 minute action scene in a church will blow you away. Mathew Vaugn didn't use a lot of VFX effects or a lot of technical aspects during the action scenes, but he placed his cameras brilliantly which allowed him to show it in slow and fast motion which are is effective while watching. This movie may also be compared to 007 movie because of the freaky gadgets like granite lighter, poison in the pen etc. But of course its not bond at all. It may very well be called as Vaughn's ode to the spy movies. When we talk about the performances, Samuel Jackson tops the chart. After Django unchained he once again proves that he can be one hell of a bad ass villain. Colin firth is having time of his life because comparing to the Kings Speech(2012) this must be relatively easy role for him and he gives a commendable performance. Its incredible that he did all the stunts on his own in this venture. Mark strong is reliable actor who doesn't disappoints. But all the credit goes to the director who seems to be in total control. After X men: first class, he left X men: Days of the future past to direct this movie. I must admire his passion for taking one of the biggest risks through this movie and succeeding in it.  What I felt short about this movie is that sometimes I got the essence of a little Christopher Nolan in the film. The way story is constructed from the beginning resembles to the way Nolan usually does in his movies. The violence in the movie some viewers may find graphic, but I am okay with that. I found editing of the movie as a shortcoming because there were 1-2 week scenes in the movie which couldn't have made any difference to the story if they were cut. To sum it up, despite of some minor flaws, ultra violent action, King. n is one hell of a roller coaster ride and I think every entertainment seeker should take that ride.The greatest superhero movie ever. (Contains spoilers) I had heard before I saw this film that critics were calling it 'the greatest superhero movie ever', which I assumed to be bluster and exaggeration. However I now stand corrected - I can safely say this film is my personal favourite of any superhero film and stands among the greatest; The Dark Knight, Spiderman 2 and most importantly perhaps above Avengers itself.  The story was, for the first time in a while, actually gripping, clever and devious. The twist of Hydra being integrated into SHIELD, controlling it and turning the concept of the the world's good spy network on its head. Brilliantly played and I never would have seen it coming. The inclusion of Dr Zola was also brilliant in his brief yet cool appearance which was a fantastic allusion to the comic books. The plot twists were many and every one made me gasp and get excited like I was a 5 year old boy. The 'death' of Nick Fury, the twist of Hydra, the reappearance of Nick Fury... All brilliant. Even though this is a spoilers filled review I won't actually write any more about the story twists as I don't want to sap any of them. Probably already did actually... Oh well just work with me.  The characters are all played to perfection. Chris Evans again is fantastic as Cap, showing the right balance of justice, bravery, humour, devotion, charisma and the sense of being lost in the modern world which makes him brilliant. Scarlett Johansson is again great as Black Widow and in her 3rd outing of the character still had plenty of tricks and great dialogue and scenes that kept the character alive. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is as stern and cool as ever, yet also we see a more sensitive side to him and a more damaged side which I felt was very well played allowing us to feel more attached to a character I believe in the Avengers was not particularly likable. (But still cool) Robert Redford as Pierce is charming, calculating and devious, making him the perfect antagonist who seems likable and genuine yet turns out to be much more cruel than we thought. This comes onto the Winter Soldier where my only issue lies - I think Sebastian Stan played him superbly as the character came across as a cold assassin yet when he starts to remember we instantly feel attached to poor ol' Bucky, who seems so vulnerable and confused. Where my issue lies is not in the acting but in that the character did not get enough screen time - more focus was on SHIELD/Hydra and Fury/Hill/Widow/Cap than the dynamic between Cap and his old friend, which whilst still there could have been delved into a bit more. However what was there was superb. Additionally Toby Jones as Zola was maniacal and great; Cobie Smulders as Hill was again the kick- ass female commander who was cool, calm and clever; and finally Frank Grillo was great at playing Brock Rumlow aka Crossbones, you're typical soldier-bad guy who seemed good but turned out to be evil.  Finally I want to review the mid-credit and post-credit scenes, if you don't want to read these stop reading now (although you've already come this far, might as well carry on): The mid-credits scene added yet another twist to the story which made me squeal in delight and ties into Avengers: Age of Ultron; we saw Baron Strucker for the first time who sounded very calculating and evil, as the new head of Hydra should; what was more interesting was that he now had in his possession Loki's sceptre from Avengers which I for one had completely forgotten about but can only mean trouble. Furthermore we saw in twin cells two prisoners (and potential experiments of Hydra's?) who were twins - Quicksilver dashing madly around his cell looking confused and Scarlet Witch who in her cell was levitating blocks and then crushed them at the end looking, quite frankly, deranged, which to me screams a potentially brilliant portrayal of the character. I look forward to Avengers 2 even more now. The post-credit scene showed Bucky/Winter Soldier going to the Smithsonian to see a Captain America exhibit Steve had visited earlier in the film, looking on at a board detailing the life of Bucky and the sacrifices he made, which showed the Winter Soldier was attempting to find himself; this did fill a little of the lack of Winter Soldier-ness I mentioned earlier, it was very touching and also hints to his appearance later on in the franchise. Overall a cracking film that had everything a good comic book/superhero movie should have and more. Truly fantastic work from the Russo brothers. Also I should mention here the music by Henry Jackman was also fantastic and had me elated, on the edge of my seat and in tears, sometimes all at once. Thanks for reading!Captain America : Kick-Ass Better movie then the 1st part. More action, more interesting story, more Captain's kick-ass fighting against all characters in the movie. Chris Evans is muscle man without serious acting. This is best movie role for his acting talent. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is perfect for this role, but for example she has talent for serious movie like in The Prestige. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in this movie have (in my opinion) best "running away with car" scene ever. All other characters not very important. Robert Redford as present Hydra leader has role of some business man that can do what ever he want until he dies. Falcon has cool wings but Iron Man can fly without wings...Great movie This movie was absolutely great in my opinion; it might even be my favourite Marvel movie at this moment.  The beginning already sets a bit of a mood for this movie. We see Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, and he is starting to get used to this world, the 21st century. He is a charming and a bit quirky guy. Especially the relationship between him and Natasha Romanoff, aka the Black Widow, is absolutely amazing! She is a strong female character and that is so great to see in a superhero movie.  The movie soon turns into a conspiracy spy movie esque setting, we see old characters returning. Basically: S**t just goes down.  At some point there was a bit too much action in my opinion. Not overwhelmingly much so as it distracts you, but still, a teensy bit too much. The soundtrack is great though, the characters are amazing; it is just a pleasure to watch it.  No spoilers here, so just go and watch it.Captain Scarlett Winter That's just about right, that should've been the title, honest. I didn't have huge expectations when I went to see this film and I was right. The entire film is captured in the trailer and there is not much left to see on the big screen. The plot: Captain Steve "America" Rogers played by Chris Evans returns for the second time to the save the world, and by world I mean America, from the faintly remembered HYDRA, the hi-tech Nazi Unit in Captain America 1. There are a lot of references to the first film, better watch it once to refresh your memory, if you can sit through that one again. The film entirely revolves around 3 characters, mainly Steve Rogers, Falcon and Black Widow and the occasional kick-ass appearance of The Winter Soldier. Kinda makes you wonder throughout the film where, at least one other Avengers member is. The film is littered with clich√©s, references and many highly obvious plot points that you could predict the story and leave the cinema 30 minutes into the film. The movie is action packed and certainly better than it's predecessor. The Winter Soldier scenes are intense and the sequences are very precisely coordinated. Cinematography, directing are plus points and the occasional humor is appreciated in an otherwise blatant Avengers: The Age of Ultron set up. One time watch, for Scarlett Johansson and The Winter Soldier. (Don't sit through the credits for the post credits scene, isn't worth the wait.)Haircut turn-off... I would have given this film 8 stars if it hadn't been for, to say it mildly, Scarlett Johansson's rather disgusting haircut. What were they thinking. I mean she was rocking those big red curls in Iron Man 2, and her haircut in The Avengers wasn't that bad either. When i saw the poster i thought to myself "Meh, that's probably just a bad picture. Maybe she just swung her hair in right that moment". But no... it's real. She's still attractive though, but she just went from a 12/10 to a 9/10 because of that hair. But if we ignore this, it's a great movie filled with a lot of cool action scenes, and both interesting and funny dialog. Bring back the big curls in the next movie please!!OK, Marvel finally did it It's general knowledge (GENERAL KNOWLEDGE - OK, sorry, Smulders)that marvel lost, in some films, the spirit of a good movie by making it look too much goofy. Thor 2 had already changed this a little bit, but now, in this one, they finally found the right measure: a serious movie with some funny and well placed lines to break all the tension. Personally, I HATE Captain America since I was a little kid. I really do. Reading my comic books years ago I used to want him to die (yes). After this movie, this feeling hasn't changed: I still think he is annoying as hell. But, anyway, I loved the movie!!! why? because it's not centered in him and in the Winter Soldier. It's all about SHIELD. This movie shows Black Widow in her best performance so far (how can Rogers reject her? OH MY!) and has a very good background history about HYDRA and SHIELD, with epic and unexpected twists. It has great fight scenes, tension, the Falcon kicking some asses and an AWESOME ending that will change the whole direction of marvel's storyline, including The Avengers 2, making this movie a must-see in Marvel's universe. And, by the way, the references to Stephen Strange, QS and Scarlet Witch were awesome as well, introducing them perfectly.  This is, excluding The Avengers, marvel's best movie until now. HAIL HYDRA!On par with Avengers This film was outstanding! I really didn't care for the first one all that much but liked the Captain America character portrayed in the Avengers. It's interesting to me to see how much impact changing the director can have. I've never been a huge fan of Joe Johnston (Jumanji/Jurassic Park 3) who directed the first one. This movie has a whole different tone to it and was just well executed start to finish. In my opinion, this was one of the best Marvel movies and in some ways better than Avengers. Felt Christopher Nolanesque at points as well. The fight scenes were superbly choreographed, and the acting is very solid. I thought Black Widow was by far better in this than Iron Man 2 or Avengers. Do yourself a favor and go see this. It will not disappoint.One of the best entries in the MCU Captain America became one of my favorite comic book characters after I watched First Avenger. I had low expectations for the movie because the character wasn't as cool or awesome like Iron Man, Thor, the X-Men, Spider-Man, the Hulk, and even Batman. After watching First Avenger, I was excited for the next Captain America movie. Winter Soldier did not disappoint. The movie is one of the best entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. Captain America-Winter Soldier takes place two years after the events of the first Avengers movie. Captain Steve Rogers is now working at S.H.I.E.L.D alongside fellow Avenger Black Widow, Nick Fury, and Maria Hill. He still feels like a man out of time in our modern day society. Rogers finds out about Project Insight which eliminates threats before they even happen via three Helicarriers after a mission. He learns not everything is what it seems. The newest threat that Cap has to face is the mysterious assassin called the Winter Soldier. After the assassin kills Nick Fury, Captain America goes on the run from S.H.I.E.L.D. The only help that he has are Black Widow, Sam Wilson/Falcon, and Maria. They face a threat from the past that comes back to haunt them. Captain America-Winter Soldier is one of the best comic book movies that I have watched in recent years. It's on up there with Iron Man 1, X-Men: Days of Future Past, Captain America-First Avenger, Spider-Man 2, the Avengers, X-Men 1, Guardians of the Galaxy, X2: X-Men United, Thor 1, and the Dark Knight. I enjoyed the movie a lot. It had a great story- line that will keep you interested through out the movie. There are some great twists in the movie (except for the major one if you're a comic book fan whose familiar with the Winter Soldier story-line). The movie's soundtrack was also amazing. The special effects and CGI look great. Unlike the recent Iron Man and Thor sequels, the humor in Winter Soldier felt more natural. The new characters (Agent 13, Alexander Pierce, Sam Wilson, and Brock Rumlow) introduced in the movie were great additions to the MCU. My favorite of the new characters is Sam Wilson aka Falcon. I love his interactions with Captain America. Can't wait to see more of Sam Wilson/Falcon in future MCU movies. Captain America-Winter Soldier is definitely one of the best comic book movies that I've seen in recent years. It is an amazing addition to the MCU. It has a great story with espionage/thriller tones. This is one Marvel movie that I will be watching over and over again.Marvel Studio's answer to The Dark Knight The best Marvel Cinematic Universe film there has ever been, with the exception of The Avengers. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is first and foremost a political thriller with the essence of a superhero movie. Returning to the role of Steve Rodgers, I can safely and assuredly say that Chris Evans is Captain America. One of the best parts of this sequel was the chemistry between the actors, especially between Evans and Scarlett Johansson. The dialogue they share stays compelling and doesn't feel forced at all. And speaking about not feeling forced, Anthony Mackie joins the cast as The Falcon. This could've easily been one of the weak points of the film, as history has proved that the addition of a sidekick tends to backfire on the film. However, Mackie does a great job in providing humour and playing a character that Rodgers can truly identify with and befriend, as they are both war veterans and have similar outlooks on life. Samuel Jackson has appeared in his fair share of Marvel films, yet he was always just a voice in the background. That couldn't be farther from the truth in Marvel's newest addition to their cinematic universe because Nick Fury finally gets down and gritty. The action has never been better and greater than they are here. From the martial arts style fights to the epic set piece battles to an incredibly shot car chase scene, this film will not only amaze superhero fans but action fans as well. Many people are interested about the Winter Soldier and if he is a worthy and menacing antagonist, and the answer to that question is an emphatic yes. Sebastian Stans's performances reminds me of Tom Hardy's Bane from The Dark Knight Rises in that both men have most of their face covered, with their eyes telling a story all on their own. Being the figure in the shadows and suddenly appearing out of nowhere throughout the movie was fantastic as it helped maintain the tone that the directors were gunning for. This is Marvel's response to The Dark Knight in terms of its dark and gritty approach, tackling spy and political themes that are very relevant in today's world. The Russo brother's directing of this film, I think, was probably the best aspect of it. They did a marvellous job in transitioning from the action scenes to the comedy, and then to the emotional character driven moments. Not to be out shined, the script was the best of the Marvel movies, and a large part of that was the character development, which some superhero movies tend to lack. Is it a great superhero movie? Yes. Is it a great MOVIE? Yes. Does it take the genre and go beyond its own limitations and journey into uncharted territory, just as The Dark Knight did? Yes. This is truly an exciting time to be living in.The ultimate action movie This is an amazing movie. i was really impressed by the movie. I am looking forward for action blockbuster in the Cap America series. Especially in 3D, final fight was superb. And Chris Evans impressed me very much.And the timing of little bit humor is awesome. As usual Sam.L.Jackson proved what an actor he is. And story line dint lost any logic even after having action scenes.This movie is worth seeing trice. Looking forward for the Avengers 2 movie. Hope it will reach the standards of Cap America 2 Movie. And a terrific elevator fight sequence probably stands out as truly memorable whereas the encounters with the Winter Soldier never feel repetitive. The actors are absolutely brilliant in their roles. This film is simply exceptional in every way.Amazing from start to finish.. As Steve Rogers struggles to embrace his role in the modern world, he teams up with a fellow Avenger and S.H.I.E.L.D agent, Black Widow, to battle a new threat from history: an assassin known as the Winter Soldier. Captain America: The Winter Soldier not only it's better than the original but it expands upon it with quick and awesome action and fight sequences that are freaking amazing to just sit threw and watch and although the soundtrack isn't as memorable as it wanted to be it still works especially in that scene where Nick Fury returns what i also forgot to mention is the big and cool chase scene with Fury once more it's also really good to see Maria Hill and Peggy Carter back too although seeing Peggy old kinda breaks my heart to be honest the Falcon makes his debut and he is pretty awesome too. Now let's talk about Marvel's long time problem which is the villains both The Winter Soldier and Alexander Pierce were really great villains and fit well with the movie also the lack of humor was for the best something that the next film truly had a problem with. The film was directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo who also directed Civil War a movie with a poor choice for a villain, boring pacing and it pretty much destroyed every hero that i once loved Civil War is the Iron Man 2 of the Trilogy but First Avenger and Winter Soldier is the Iron Man of the Trilogy but instead of one awesome film we get 2 of them. As for problems? Well it's mostly the ending where Steve chooses not to fight Bucky and he gets his ass kicked and he stops because Steve tells him "I'm with you till the end of the line" ring any bells? Anyways besides that the film is truly a masterpiece with a lot of non stop tension and action and the only way i can describe it it's that it's one hell of an action packed Political Action, Drama, Thriller kind of movie and it doesn't disappoint unlike what came after it.Like most Marvel based films it is violent rubbish You have to be rather short of brain cells to think that this sort of thing is where the film industry should be going. People who never die. Yep lots of that. People who can be beaten to a pulp and walk away like they have been for tea with their mum, yes loads of that. Lack of any sort of comprehensible plot, yep loads of that too. I wasn't expecting much as the day of any sort of reality in these films went out of the window with Iron Man 2. But really? Can't the American dream factory come up with anything better? If you think that this level of violence is not having an effect on kids you should step outside and see what it is doing to kids younger than 10 who I have seen stamp on their fellow children and think its funny. Still you cannot expect either parents to keep their children from watching this nor can you expect the people who make this stuff have any thought of their responsibility. Ahh well, the world continues down its black hole into oblivion!Numbers Game Robert Redford is willing to sacrifice hundreds of millions for the lives of billions, the 'good guys' are willing to kill hundreds to save the lives of those hundreds of millions. Both are playing a numbers game, the only difference is that Redford's is on a bigger scale and isn't hypocritical, he acknowledges the human cost, the 'good guys' treat the hundreds of soldiers they kill (and the many civilian casualties resulting from their lavish tactics) simply as necessary to get the job done. This is a fight of visionaries against hypocrites, and hypocrites win. An awful message, an awful movie. It also has the standard 'just in the nick of time' tropes, ridiculous and impossible fight scenes, a frankly annoying score and the ever-loathable Samuel L Jackson.Captain Americanned This movie was absolute garbage. Captain America wouldn't know if he was Arthur or Martha in the modern world. An out of date character given a storyline by writers more concerned with blowing stuff up than adhering to the righteous values held dear by the character they're writing for. Put old Captain America in a pub and have him start a conversation about workplace discrimination with the villain Average Joe. I'd prefer to read a novel written by authors with imagination, rather than watch self indulgent producers, writers and directors more concerned with making the "best" version of whatever character, storyline or dialogue they're ripping off. Enjoy!!!Boring turd of a film. Two and a half hours of predictability and blandness. The Marvel brand is really going down the pan if they think this is worthy of watching by anyone other than an explosion happy 8 year old... anyone that can meet it's PG-13 rating must surely be too old for this rubbish. I used to love the Marvel brand in it's earlier days, but this is just another example of them releasing turd after turd in quick succession while the brand is still popular. Bland, predictable and boring is all I can say about this film. All three of the major plot surprises are, actually, not surprising. You KNOW Fury isn't dead even as they pronounce him dead... BORING, you KNOW Bucky Barnes is the bad guy even before you meet him... BORING and you know the guy in the stiff suit is the puppet master as soon as he meets good ol' cap... BORING! So the plot is predictable and the action is predictable too. Not one surprise in the whole film... BORING. Never has two and a half hours felt so much like five. Following hot on the heels of Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy, I feel I've got to be more choosy with Marvel now. Maybe Marvel should change their name to Disney, as they are aiming squarely at children now.
Annoyingly inaccurate As the film announces at the start, it based on a true story. The essentials are true, and to get so much history into a film things have to be condensed. Unfortunately unnecessarily inaccurate things were portrayed which didn't save any time. For example, Turing mutters under his breath so most audiences will not notice, that the Poles made the first crucial breakthrough. By the start of the war, the Poles led by Marian Rejewski had been breaking Enigma for over six years and built the first machine, called a "bomba" in 1938. In July 1939 the Poles passed on all the information to the French and British including details of the bomba and their successes at a meeting which included Denniston. The problem started to mount for the Poles and later the British when other rotors could be swapped in and the indicator method was changed by the Germans. The film is correct in showing that Turing's genius was using known words from the coded messages to reduce the myriad of possibilities. This idea happened in 1939 and so he started from the outset to design the British "bombes" to use this method, not after they had been running for months. Four senior code-breakers, not just Alan Turing, but also Gordon Welchman, Stuart Milner-Barry and Hugh Alexander wrote to Churchill in 1941 over Denniston's head about the shortage of staff and praising Edward Travis. In February 1942, Denniston was demoted and transferred elsewhere. His successor, Edward Travis, transformed the procedures. Cairncross, played by Downton's ex-chauffeur, never appeared at Bletchley until 1942 and the alleged blackmail is an unnecessary red-herring. The idea that there would be a chart on the wall in Hut 8 showing the latest positions of all Atlantic convoys is laughable. This chart was in a secure bunker in Liverpool that was as closely guarded as Bletchley Park. Turing's team had no input into how the information was to be used, but it is true that Ultra intelligence had to be supported by other information and so patrols were sent out to find what was known to be already there. Lastly Turing would never, ever, have disclosed even the existence of Bletchley Park to a detective he had just met. The performance of Benedict Comberbatch is exceptional, and the rest of the cast good. Keira Knightley is pretty enough to have turned even Turing, but, despite the lines that told us, she never gave the impression she had a double first in mathematics from Cambridge. Good film, though it could have be closer to reality without making it longer or more complex.Compelling and Enthralling from start to finish. Truly excellent film and definitely Ocsar worthy material for both the film and the actors. The entire cast are amazing. As Cumberbatch says near the start of the film "are you paying attention". You should pay attention, Alan Turing deserves your attention, his story deserves to be told. I went to see this at the London Film Festival last week and I am going to be one of the first ones in the cue to see it when it comes out next month. It is an excellently paced and executed script that has you gripped from beginning to end. The whole audience were laughing and applauding and crying in places, including the man next to me who had to borrow a hankie from his wife. The film switches between the drive of the team of code breakers to solve the Enigma code, young Alan Turing and the events after the war that destroyed his life.  It is truly heartbreaking in places, and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Alan Turing is outstanding. He really deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance. It has been a very, VERY long time since I enjoyed a film so much, that when I came out of the Cinema I wanted to turn right round and go back in and watch it again. A lovely script that had you switching back and forwards between tears and laughter. I know some wanted a more in depth and in detail look at Alan Turing's life and have commented frequently that this does no focus enough on his sexuality or the events after the war. In this case I think less is more, this film highlights the man and the mind. It shows us the genius that was destroyed by a society that was seriously homophobic. It brings to life the man behind the facts and we laugh at his interactions with his fellow code breakers and cheer as he proves his theories and our hearts break as we watch him try to cope after his court case. One of the best films I have seen in a long time. Go and see judge for yourself.An Eminently Well-Made Biopic Brilliant adaptation of the story of Bletchley Park and the cryptanalysis team, ran by Alan Turing, that cracked the code of the German Enigma Machine during World War II. Featuring an outstanding starring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as war hero Turning and supporting acts from a brilliant cast including Keira Knightley, Charles Dance and Mark Strong, 'The Imitation Game' is a powerful and eminently well-made biopic that illuminates the facts whilst respecting the story it is based upon. The English-language debut of 'Headhunters' director Morten Tyldum, this British World War II thriller is a highly conventional story about humanity that creates a fascinating character, anchored by a hypnotically complex performance.A gross distortion of people and events. Although well crafted and paced by good professionals in almost every sphere of film making, The Imitation Game is sadly reduced to a piece of populist pulp by the dominance of formulaic 'Hollywood' principles that entirely distort the key events and personnel involved. Alan Turing did not alone invent the code breaking machine seen in the film. He worked in a team headed by Dilly Knox, not even depicted in the film, who succeeded in breaking the code on 23 January 1940. Gordon Welchman, again not depicted in the film, later headed the military section that developed the 'Bombe' machine (called 'Christopher' in the film) albeit with Turing's help but not under his total dominance as suggested in this fiction. Moreover the 'Bombe' was not a computer as the film states. It was a mere calculator rather than a programmable digital machine. The first computer at Bletchly was developed years later under Max Newman when Tommy Flowers designed 'Collossus'. This film intensely distorts these events and is a disgraceful insult to those who actually did the work. Worse still the film completely misrepresents Joan Clarke who is depicted as a rather attractive crossword enthusiast recruited by Turing because she can solve puzzles faster than him. This was utter rubbish. Clarke, a 'plain Jane' type mathematician, was already employed at Bletchly when Turing arrived. Even Alan Turing himself is misrepresented in character. Eccentric he certainly was but the arrogance shown in the film has no real foundation. Moreover he was not uncomfortable with his sexuality or even the hormonal treatment he received as depicted at the end of the film. His friends report that he laughed about developing breasts that would increase his attractiveness to other men. But the film, funded by the powers that are today, cannot even suggest the dreadful possibility that Turing's death was not the suicide so adamantly stated at the end. Turing was devoted to his mother (also never depicted in the film) and the concept of his suicide without leaving her a letter is inconceivable. He had been warned by MI6 only months before his death not to continue his homosexual lifestyle (they were paranoid after the Burgess-Maclean saga) but he continued to visit Greece where he openly took up with gay men. Entirely happy only a few days before we are told that he then took his own life whilst eating an apple. His family and friends maintain the real chance that he was expediently removed by MI6 as a security risk. And poisoning food with cyanide was then a well used technique in security circles for such requirements. When a film depicts a Cambridge Professor of Mathematics attacking a machine with a heavy spanner because it is not working fast enough, when a film repeats the single memorable line about unimaginable people doing the unimaginable three times in 30 minutes, when a film states that the central character had the power to decide 'who was to live and who was to die' (again a total nonsense because how the code was used was decided at top Cabinet level and not by the code breakers at all) when such rubbish is presented alongside a string of historical distortions you will know that is essentially rubbish and a waste of time to watch. And Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, though competent, was too reminiscent of Derek Jacobi's famous BBC2 portrayal in places to be thought of as original. Timothy Spall as Mr. Turner was not even Oscar nominated for his excellent portrayal but Cumberbatch has been included to expand the Turing myth. Thank God Eddy Redmayne is there to take the prize for his staggering performance as Steven Hawking.Morten Tyldum's espionage thriller about Alan Turing is purely sensational with a performance for the ages by Benedict Cumberbatch... It took a little over 24 hours before I weighed in on my official thoughts on Morten Tyldum's The Imitation Game from The Weinstein Company. My initial reaction upon leaving the screening room was it was astonishing, a magnificent achievement that stands tall as one of the year's best movies. As the film continues to settle within my cinematic soul, this very well could be the best film of the year, anchored by a career best performance from the amazing Benedict Cumberbatch.  Full disclosure, I'm fairly oblivious to European history and the heroes that had a hand in one of the deadliest wars in history. I've heard the name Alan Turing from high school and college but either didn't care enough to learn or have no recollection of his contributions. Minutes following the screening, Amazon.com got $15.82 from my bank account in order to read "Alan Turing: The Enigma," the book in which screenwriter Graham Moore based the story upon. Telling the story of Alan Turing, a mathematician who in 1939 led a pioneer in cracking one of the most difficult codes in history. His contributions paved the way for essentially the way we exist now. However, Turing, who is a homosexual, has to wrestle with his secret in order to keep his status and his work years later. Masterfully told and encompassing an emotional complexity, Tyldum's film is both engrossing and disturbing. It has genius aspirations in which it wants to exist in the cinematic world. It's an impeccable thriller, taut and brilliant, exploring the horrors of war along with the choices that doom mankind for all eternity. Tyldum is methodical and precise in which he decides to unravel the story, Turing is one of the fallen heroes of our history and his story stands as one of the most tragic. Screenwriter Moore crafts a murky, dark, yet totally enjoyable spy film that stands taller than any James Bond film ever released. It's a sure-fire Oscar contender for several Academy Awards including Best Picture. They should feel so lucky to have the gumption to choose something this methodical and majestic. Benedict Cumberbatch continues to climb the ladder as one of the best actors working today. After impressive performances August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, and TV's "Sherlock," this is the role that will make him a bonafide movie star. Oscar-winner or not, this will be looked upon like the greats such as Gene Hackman in The French Connection or any legendary 70's movie that you love today. Cumberbatch hones in on all of Turing's character flaws and good qualities that make him a real person. He constructs him from the toes up, inflicting mannerisms and behaviors that all ring true. He stimulates all the sensual beats that keep us fixated on a performance. I can't help but go back to someone like Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, who delivered a construction of epic proportions. Though based on a real person, the talented Cumberbatch ignites his own masterpiece performance. He follows the demons of Turing down to his bones. Unsure, arrogant, and dismissive to the world around him, Turing shows only what he must, what he chooses, and every once in a while, we get a front seat to his soul. Thank you Cumberbatch. The rest of the cast is completely on their game. It's probably a contender for the SAG Ensemble prize. Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley, as the feisty and fiery Joan Clark, is as loose and comfortable as I've ever seen her. She wears Joan like an old coat from the back of the closet. Remembering it fondly and seeing that it fits just perfect. She has all the things that make up an Oscar nominee; a scene that will likely bring you to tears, plenty of scenes that play as the comic relief in a dark tale, and being simply charming in every part of the film.  I don't know when it's going to happen but the world needs to make Matthew Goode a mega-star. In his brief time on-screen, Goode makes his mark, becoming essentially a co-anchor with Knightley of the supporting players, showcasing a reason to give this guy his own leading role sooner rather than later. As our resident sleazy authority figure, Charles Dance shows that he's still got it. Mark Strong and Allen Leech also deliver memorable, fascinating scenes, both getting an opportunity to shine. Technical merits are no shortage of excellence on display. Oscar- winning Editor William Goldenberg (Argo) shows that tension is his second language. Cutting the film to perfection, and forcing your heart into throat, this espionage thriller succeeds for general audiences because of Goldenberg's efforts. It's something that anyone can seek out and get fully immersed into. Alexandre Desplat tacks another impressive composition to his already thick resume. With films like The Grand Budapest Hotel already in his arsenal, I assume this to be another Oscar citation in his future. Shot by the talented Oscar Faura, responsible for painting the canvas that was J.A. Bayona's The Impossible, he utilizes the standard brilliance of capturing a moment. Knows when to pull back and get close. Let's not forget the Production and Costume Design by Maria Djurkovic and Sammy Sheldon Differ. Those two will surely be mentioned for the rest of the film year. The Imitation Game is assertive and makes a serious claim as one of the best spy thrillers ever made. There are sub plots that all resonate and never feel forced. This will not only keep your tension level at a fever pitch but could leave you in tears to walk home with. It's a complete realistic view at the spy game that stands as one of the best films of the year and a performance for the ages from Benedict Cumberbatch. A captivating achievement that I'll likely remember for some time.The Turing Test Alan Turing, Mathematician, Logician, Wartime Codebreaker and father of Computer Science. A great British Hero. A great hero in the fight against prejudice. This film tackles themes of prejudice against the feminine, against homosexuality and more generally against anyone who is different. How? By simply pointing out, using the example of Alan Turing and his colossal achievements, that it takes someone different to do something amazing. And an amazing story it is, packaged in a beautifully tight screenplay without a wasted scene, that keeps the audience fully engaged throughout. All the cast are on top form, in orbit around a stellar performance by Benedict Cumberbatch that layers humour, complexity, sexuality and the palpable frustration of a brilliant mind not quite able to communicate with his fellow humans. A film that depicts a man who perhaps fails the test he invented, that is now named after him. The Turing Test. Can he fool you that he is a real human being and not a super intelligent machine? The stress of playing that Imitation Game is set into every micro twitch of the central character. Should you go see it? No special effects. No interstellar spaceships. Why not wait for the download? Go see it! Because otherwise you would be missing the chance to see a most remarkable film, performed to perfection. A film about a story that matters, about events that changed history and simply about a man without whom you might not even be able to read this review on your Turing machine.A twenty-first century political fable unrelated to Alan Turing This film, while entertaining, aims mainly to be a purely twenty-first century anti-bullying parable, regardless of the historical truth about Alan Turing. While I have been more firmly opposed than most to boarding school bullying, in this case, the nobler the goal, the worse the writing. The film tries unsuccessfully to make Turing both a friendless quasi-autistic lone genius, and the head of the entire decryption project; neither point has any relation to reality, and barely cohere to each other. (I admit to some bitterness about this slur on my grand- supervisor, since it implicitly denies the existence of my graduate-school supervisor.) The film also does disservice to Joan Clarke's genuine contributions, substituting a muddled and completely ahistorical subplot about her professional dependence on, and mathematical superiority to, Turing, while seeming more concerned with her appearance than her intellect.Good enough but historically sketchy This is a good enough movie, but skirts around the true story in order to make a clunky point about a genius hounded to death for his homosexuality. The plot is simple. Britain is losing the war and desperately needs something to have a chance of survival. Cracking Nazi codes to stop attacks at sea and in the air might just tip the balance. Step forward the secret decoding establishment at Bletchley Park, where expert mathematicians and linguists are recruited to try and break the famous codes sent via the German Enigma machines. And step forward one Alan Turing of Cambridge University, resident if gay genius played by Benedict Cumberbatch. To break the codes apparently Turing invents a machine to do this. Of course, this is all nonsense -the Poles had built machines previously to do this work and had broken Enigma, but with increasing sophistication they no longer had the resources so handed over their work to the British, along with a captured Enigma machine from the Wehrmacht. So tension mounts as Turing uses tons of money on a new (sic) totally innovative machine which does not seem to be quick enough. On the way an overly attractive Joan Clark (played by Keira Knightley), a double first, helps out and gets engaged to Turing, while silly old Commander Dennison played by Charles Dance tries to close down the machine!!!!! Eventually a chance remark and a realisation of something bleedin' obvious puts Turing and co on the right track. Just time for - we must not use all information or Jerry will know we have broken his codes, so little chat about who is saved and who isn't, which is pretty peripheral, before getting to the climax where Turing is chemically castrated by an unfeeling and totally ungrateful country. The thriller elements are okay, but Turing can do no wrong except tell Clark to leave Bletchley, which gets short feminist shrift! Oh dear, the script cannot help itself from being so terribly 21st century liberal in its preachy parts. A pity some other unsung heroes like Tommy Flowers and the Poles do not get a mention! The acting is fine all round, the direction serviceable, and it works at its own level, but the one man band tub thumping with Cumberbatch twitching and not looking directly at people (obvious Oscar material like 'Rain Man') really does a disservice to the great team effort of the wartime code breakers. Remember, an even more advanced, valve-based machine for breaking codes was developed with little participation from Turing by a working class GPO man - Tommy Flowers, who used his own money to finance it. Hope his story is not overlooked just because he was straightforwardly normal!After careful consideration, I am afraid to announce this film is overrated. While it is a moderately decent film on a noble subject matter, I never felt thrilled, moved or otherwise captivated in a way that deserves over the top praise from other reviewers in my humble opinion. I felt that many opportunities to create dramatic tension and stunning photography were thrown away as a result of the insertion of ill-fitting material (black and white footage of Hitler? really?) and poor script and acting (Keira is bland as vanilla I am afraid to say). It wasn't all bad. Translating the challenge of cryptanalysis into film is a challenge which I think was valiantly attempted, though excessively dumbed down. A number of sub-plots are introduced in different time frames, one in Turing's childhood and one after the war. Sadly they fail to deliver any meaningful drama, again as a result of mediocre writing. If anything they are distracting and defuse any tension that might have built up in the scenes that precede them. As such, the editing did feel amateurish. The ending was extremely disappointing: why use lines of text to depict that which can be shown instead?  Finally there is a rather out of place scene with a barely disguised and hypocritical feminist agenda. I say that because that particular scene was fictional and never happened in reality, so its existence can only be justified by such an agenda. I refer to the moment Keira Knightly attempts to sit an exam to join Turing's code breakers' team. An incredulous usher, convinced she is present for a job interview as a secretary instead (because the evil patriarchy couldn't possibly contemplate she is as capable as men - see how subtle that was? wow) refuses her entry until our hero Turing intervenes and allows her in.  We are also told this female character has a double first in mathematics from Cambridge. If wartime Britain was so sexist, why does she hold such a distinguished degree? And if sexism is so evil, then why fall does the script fall in the trap of using her as an emotional element in the story but glosses over the contribution her brilliant mind made to Turing's efforts? Now THAT my friends, is sexist and the film could have done without this ridiculous and off-topic political manifesto. It was the final nail in the coffin as far as I was concerned. I shall not watch this again, however I do fancy reading a biography of Alan Turing, maybe something the film can take credit for.This is a truly terrible film with some reasonably good acting. How this film ever managed to get Oscar nominated for the best adapted screenplay is beyond me. The old press adage "never let the facts get in the way of a good story" doesn't even apply here as the story, as told in the film, is the most complete and utter tosh from start to finish. Anyone with even the most cursory knowledge of what went on at Bletchley Park and Turing's part in it should be infuriated with the raft of inaccuracies presented as fact here and the frankly ludicrous supposition that Turing would have told anything at all about his work there to a rookie detective. Special mention should go to the scenery-chewing performance of Charles Dance as Alastair Denniston, leading his band of Military Police thugs to destroy the Bombe (hand-built by Turing on his own at Bletchley and lovingly named 'Christoper' by him, according to this film, but in reality built in Letchworth by a large team which included Gordon Welchman, Oliver Lawn and chief engineer Harold Keen and actually called Victory.) Denniston was undoubtedly somewhat antagonistic towards his motley team of code-breakers, but this portrayal - no offence to Mr. Dance - is so over the top as to be laughable. Yes, the acting is good, given the drivel that is the script, but I finished the film furious at the injustice done both to the people shown and to those shamefully airbrushed out. As others have said, there are amazing stories to be told, both about Bletchley Park and about the life of Alan Turing and there are many excellent books, including Sinclair McKay's 'The Secret Life Of Bletchely Park', which tell a much more accurate and, in my view, engrossing tale than this appalling travesty. Do yourself a favour and read them rather than watching this steaming pile of ordure. What finally persuaded me to write this review was overhearing a conversation in a diner in Brooklyn where someone who had just seen the film was describing it to his dining partner with these words "And this guy, this Turing, single-handedly saved the lives of millions of people despite being persecuted and blackmailed for being a fag." Way to go, film-makers.Dramatization Galore When I read the Executive Producers were the Weinstein Brothers, I immediately knew the movie will take its creative license beyond reason. I wasn't disappointed at that. "Based on true events" doesn't mean anything as probably most have learned by now. Key events in the story line are almost entirely made up. True key events have been completely ignored, and the usual Hollywood political agenda's are on full display. I didn't ask for any personal political insights, I didn't want pay for that. This movie aims directly at promoting homosexuality through emotions. First we are directed to love Turing because of his accomplishment, then we are directed to feel sad for him because he pays a price for being what he is. At the end multiple tear jerking scenes were built in to help you towards that emotional state. The clunky behavior of the genius has been depicted the way it is always depicted: somewhat stuttering, looking at the floor, no sense of humor, not understanding metaphors. All in all, stereotyping and clich√© galore right here in the very first five minutes he was introduced. Turing finds the code by sheer coincidence more or less we are led to believe. The reality is that just about every story about accidental discoveries have been debunked. Newton's apple, Archimedes bathtub, all are stories which turned out not to be true. These grand discoveries, just like cracking the Enigma Code, have been discovered by hard work and professionalism. Poland discovered the logic behind the Enigma years before the British did. The Germans increased the number of combinations, which made the code more intensive to break. The Polaks ran out of funds to create a better decoding machine and handed over the know-how to Great Britain and France. Turing (and certainly not him alone) improved the machine the Polaks built and which they called "Bombe". Not a word about that in the movie off course. Just like in the movie "Black Hawk Down", where the crucial role of the Malayan (!) snipers to bail out the Americans has been completely ignored. Also, Turing was never investigated for being a possible spy, nor did he kept knowledge of a spy to himself. He would have played with his life if he did that. He was under investigation for being a gay tho. The scene was also used to connect Turing with MI6 even more, but that was unnecessary; as it turned out in the end, Turing was more than happy to work with MI6 for his own schemes (which is a lie too). The audience will learn nothing about the code itself. Not a clue on how it works (it's not even that hard!), nothing. Code breakers are hired if they could solve crossword or cryptographic puzzles. Needless to say that the smartest person is tardy but gets to participate in the test anyway (clich√© clich√©), and turns out to be even faster than the great Turing himself! An oh, it's a woman! A completely made up event. Feminism at work in its fullest glory. Acknowledging her intelligence (she really was) is not enough it seems. She had to be the smarter than all men, including Turing. She already worked at Bletchley in reality. And she slapped Turing! Beating men is a sure sign of female strength in the doctrine of many feminists. That too never happened. In reality Joan Clarke was very submissive. Turing supposedly had a say in how to use this machine strategically. He contacted MI6 to scheme with, ignoring his employer. The reality is vice versa: MI6 instructed Turing what to do. Turing had no say. A feeble attempt to make Turing even better than he already was, but the attempt was over the top. I can't imagine the viewer didn't notice. So there it is people. This movie represents blatant promotion of multiple Hollywood agenda's, over-dramatization, over-simplification and factual incorrectness about all key events. This movie represents all that to its fullest.Fine acting but an highly inaccurate story The story of the breaking of the German ciphers during WWII is a significant one, deserving of an accurate telling. The story of Alan Turing, a key member of the team that developed the methods and machines that broke those ciphers is an important one, also deserving of an accurate telling. "The Imitation Game" is neither of these films. The story told by this film is watchable, Cumberbatch renders Turing sympathetically and, somewhat to my surprise, Knightley takes the thinly written role of Joan Clarke and turns it into something with a fair bit of heft. However, this film's story takes such liberties with the facts that it really cannot be recommended. This is *not* how the German ciphers were broken and it is not even a reasonable depiction of Turing's life, particularly so when it comes to the atrocious way he was treated after the war. You will not find Harold Keen or Gordon Welchman in this film, the writers preferring to insinuate that Turing was wholly responsible for the design and building of the bombe machines (except that Hugh Alexander is credited with the idea for improving their working that was actually Welchman's). However, you will find a Soviet spy in Turing's hut when in fact he did not work there. I could go on and list other inaccuracies. If you are unaware of the stories of Enigma and Turing, you may find this a quite interesting film to watch. If you are aware of these stories I think you may find it difficult to swallow the gross misrepresentations of both. I consider that filmmakers, when depicting real people or events, have a responsibility to tell the truth and not distort things simply for dramatic effect. When this responsibility is ignored the filmmakers have decided to, in effect, spread lies in the name of entertainment. "The Imitation Game" may be entertaining but it makes this dismal mistake and cannot be recommended.Good story, Doesn't reflect historical facts I really enjoyed watching the movie, however left the cinema disappointed! Fantastic story, great Alan Turing - pioneer of computer science. BUT - German military texts enciphered on the Enigma machine were first broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau, beginning in December 1932. This success was a result of efforts by three Polish cryptologists, Marian Rejewski, Jerzy R√≥≈ºycki and Henryk Zygalski, working for Polish military intelligence. Alan devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method. Shame Polish Intelligence was omitted in the movie.More Propaganda.... First off, the historical revisionism is testament to the pure and brazen ignorance of the production crew and lack of an historical adviser when this went into production, with the almost terrifyingly obtuse view to making a film that follows the cheap tried and tested Hollywood formula that we've all witnessed a hundred times already. From the paper boy waving a paper saying bombs were about to be dropped in '1939', to god only knows how many facets of fantasy created out of a well documented Turing's life, and I can't remember accurately right now but I think they even mentioned Churchill as being Prime Minister in 1939 which is untrue, this film was an exercise in inaccuracies. These inaccuracies I was quite prepared to forgive until I started witnessing the exact same structure of film as I would be expected to see in a comic book film. We introduce an antagonist who causes great conflict, we already know our protagonist who is a victimised target of bullies and the entire world is out to shoot him down but he must overcome great odds to beat a much more powerful enemy. We even witness the classic buddy moment where our heroes at their lowest ebb have a motivational coming together of understanding and mutual respect where their bond of friendship gives them renewed vigour and hope, and not least of all, the power to overcome their great enemy, 'The Commander'. Not to mention of course that this film even managed to chuck a twist into the mix as well. Sure, it wouldn't be a Hollywood style film without a twist now would it?  Add a couple of scenes that are so fake it'll make your head spin and you've got your film, e.g. 'his brother just happens to be on that exact boat!!??' Good grief, give me a break. This sickened me to the core of my being. Can film makers really not appreciate that people have more intelligence than that of a wombat. I'm starting to feel like a zombie whose soul reason in life is to watch the same generic film again and again and again with the odd good film thrown in like a needle in a hundred haystacks. Originality isn't even worth speculating about anymore, it's a myth that died a death with cuchulainn.  It was such a bad ploy to create this absolute ass of a character and then have us empathise with him because the world is against him. It doesn't even try to speculate that he might bring it on himself. 'Just get the damn audience to EMPATHISE' said the director, I presume. There isn't much in the way of character here, he's an ass, played very well by Cumberbatch who can do no wrong at the moment it seems, but very one dimensional a character nonetheless, Oh yes, they try to get him to change and get along with everyone which he does, but just so we could have our great comic book buddy scene where the evil 'Commander' is put in his place until the next episode of Turing and Friends when the Commander tries to destroy the world with his next fiendish plot. And what was with all the gay apologies at the end? I thought this film was about Enigma. I use the phrase 'about Enigma' quite quite loosely here since this film had very little resemblance to reality. But almost all the blurbs were about him being gay, and other gays and how they were mistreated. I'm sorry, was this film not about Enigma? Clearly not, they must have been afraid that people wouldn't want to see a film about a gay man? Looks that way. So yea, I was disappointed with this, just didn't care about the main character, too much empathy mining was going on here. Not to mention the ridiculously simplistic way in which they supposedly cracked the code. But like I've said, dumbed down cinema for easy digestion.Very very disappointing although the cast is excellent I am astonished at the rave reviews this film is getting and depressed at how many people will now go through life with their impression of Alan Turing and code breaking at Bletchley "informed" by this film. The plot is drivel. If you take this film at face value you will leave believing that Turing was single-handedly responsible for just about everything at Bletchley including the original idea for the Bombe machine not to mention constructing it on his own in a barn, recruitment of staff, the first breaking of any Enigma traffic, the idea of using known words to crack messages, making strategic decisions about whether or not to save trans-Atlantic convoys and countless other things. Most of the film is just nonsense. There is no way that Turing would have been in a position to decide not to save the convoy (or even know that there was one to save). He wasn't responsible for the idea of using standard text in messages as ways into the Enigma settings (which had been done since before the war). The construction of the Bombe machines was a huge exercise involving a team of technicians and parts supplied by external manufacturers, not Turing wiring it up alone in a barn in his shirt-sleeves. It wasn't actually even his idea; the idea of using a machine was brought to him by Dilly Knox from pre-war ideas worked up by a Polish team. Nor could the machine spit out deciphered messages after a couple of minutes. Turing wasn't in charge either, he didn't come up with ideas of using crosswords to find recruits and he wasn't alone in writing to Churchill; several of them signed the letter. Oh yes, and there were several women code-breakers at Bletchley. The screenplay is also riddled with anachronisms, which just add to the sense of "Oh this is ridiculous" throughout the film. No way would a well brought up young lady in the 1940s say "Oh my God!" three times in as many minutes. There are too many others to recall or mention. Benedict Cumberbatch and the rest of the cast are excellent in their roles with the material they are given (hence two stars rather than one) but that cannot save what is ultimately a very disappointing film. This is not a biopic of Turing, which is how it is presented, but a nonsensical made up story tacked on to a heavy-handed political point about homosexuality, which we all got without the banner at the end. Two hours I won't get back.Bland, ineffective, an offense to it's story A tragic true story told as generic, mundane and formulaic as possible. Alan Turing is known as a hero to some, yet here he is portrayed like a robot wearing a Benedict Cumberbatch costume that can shed tears when the screenplay allows for it. A screenplay that follows an out-dated guide on how to make an Academy Award winning film. For such an amazing story filled with inspiration and sadness, the filmmakers didn't bother to make any other aspect of the film daring, inventive or even slightly original. Almost every part of this production could have passed as a movie-of-the-week on some major television network. Even the soundtrack is bland, it's as black and white as the over-used stock war footage. A film portraying a story like this, especially it being a true story, should rip the heart out of it's audience, having them leaving the theater disgusted, heart-broken and angry. Instead, what we get here, is a film that rushes through everything, while watering it down, all to fit a family-friendly rating and a run-time of no longer than 2 hours. This leaves the film absolutely ineffective and it's audience indifferent. And that's the worse possible out-come of a film telling such an important, meaningful and provocative true story.An instant classic A movie which oozes Britishness from every frame, The Imitation Game is an instant classic. Wartime Britain is depicted vividly, if a little caricatured, with an autumnal palette and a jaunty air. A true story, sympathetically told, with good performances all round and a stand-out Turing from the indefatigable Mr Cumberbatch. The young Turing is also extremely well realised by Alex Lawther. Meandering through Alan Turing's life since school until shortly before his death, the script demands your attention and regularly makes you smile. Highly recommended.Hello Best Picture frontrunner. Consider me satisfied. There is something appropriately mechanical about The Imitation Game. It has a theatrical rhythm and attention to detail that ticks like a clock. That's not to say that it's necessarily overly dry and hard to connect to, this biopic of the extraordinary and tragic mathematician and inventor of the digital computer, Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, is emotionally engaging and utterly endearing. With a slick exquisite script and an eclectic ensemble strong enough to deliver, it's an accessible film that although may feel familiar, is thoroughly refreshing, bringing laughter, tears and thrills. It will undeniably be a huge contender at the big awards this season, perhaps going all the way. Director Morten Tyldum's film follows Turing's journey to break the Enigma Code, the form in which the Germans communicated during WWII to conduct surprise attacks. He attempts it by building the first computer, a passion project of his that was frequently criticized for devoting so much Government time and money. He deals with a social ineptitude while also accepting his own homosexuality, which lead to unforgivable persecution and depression that caused Turing to take his own life. The film focuses on his life achievements rather than his demise, though it does explore that part of his life, if not illustrate it as much as it could have done. It's easy to root for Turing, even if his arrogance and standoffishness repel the other characters. Benedict Cumberbatch is a real crowd pleaser here. I've only seen him in short supporting roles such as last year's August: Osage County and 12 Years A Slave and I'm certainly quite impressed, if not quite as astounded. There's a very rehearsed quality about his performance, similar to Anne Hathaway's Oscar winning turn in Les Miserables. Every stutter and nuance feels perfectly placed rather than organic. But this isn't necessarily a turn off, it fits the tone of the film. He could go all the way to the Oscar but it depends on buzz and the competition. The highlight of the film is the writing by Graham Moore, adapted from Andrew Hodges novel 'Alan Turing: The Enigma.' It's not groundbreaking, but it has the right ingredients and the perfect recipe. Even if somehow it's the only film's nomination, it's still a frontrunner for the win in Adapted Screenplay. This will be a film known for 'ticking boxes,' but it does it in a way that all films should. It's economical without ever feeling like it's rushing or only scratching the surface. It constantly pummels the characters with adversity, presenting heart-wrenching moral dilemmas, particularly for Keira Knightley's Joan Clarke. It turns something complicated and bleak quite lighthearted, especially with the casual approach to war outside of moments of justified despair. Knightley will certainly get awards attention for her fine supporting role as Turing's counterpart. Her role may not be as meaty, lacking the highs and lows Cumberbatch has, but she makes the most of her relative sparing use, becoming the heart of the film. Thanks to her, their relationship is completely believable, given that Turing is a man who struggles with connecting to people, and the way she manages the choices her character is set upon is dealt with deft conviction. Charles Dance, Mark Strong and especially Matthew Goode are commanding side presences who bolster the film's charm. The titular 'imitation game' is essentially the Replicant test from Blade Runner, something Turing has practiced on himself. However, all the characters are human here, if with a confidence you only find in the movies. Instead of a linear structure, the film chooses flashbacks to flesh out the full story of Turing. It does seem a little extraneous to go back to school with him, but fortunately the focus of their objectives and the performances of the young actors make them worthwhile, as well as showing the origin of something that changed the world as we know it. The scale is further expanded with newsreel footage and scenes of the world at war, even if the special effects are relatively primitive compared to what can be achieved these days though that doesn't hold the film back as such. It's very easy to get suckered into films that convince you that you're watching one man change the world and The Imitation Game achieves that effortlessly. Although it's dense in character and plot, The Imitation Game flashes more on the surface than it has to offer beneath. Kinetic energy in the editing brings an instant gratification, especially in the edge of your seat sequences. There are liberties with the tone for such a somber event and protagonist that most likely doesn't reflect the honest emotions involved, but obviously it's easier to digest for audience. I was unsure at first, but then it had me under its spell. This also may be Alexandre Desplat's best bet at finally winning an Oscar. It adds to that whimsical cinematic tone, almost reminiscent on his work on Harry Potter sans the magic. It will certainly be warmly embraced in the mainstream. The film is poignant, but not powerful. Entertaining, but not enlightening. I'm content calling this the Best Picture frontrunner until further notice. The film feels like a combination of Argo, with the secrets and the camaraderie of the unit, and The King's Speech, with its Britishness and charming partnerships. It depends whether the Academy fall for the ambition of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar or the Chariots of Fire + The Bridge on the River Kwai formula of Angelina Jolie's Unbroken. Either way, The Imitation Game will belong amongst the most deserving winners, but the test of time remains to be seen. It's not like it'll be alone in that group. Nevertheless, with Queen Elizabeth II's pardon for Turing last year, there's never been a better time to educate the masses on his legacy that we use everyday. 8/10 edit: guess it isn't. Oh well. Boyhood and Birdman are better anyway.Horribly inaccurate. Do not use as factual information There is a strong urge for me to create this spoiler-free review. Let me preface this. I'm a theoretical computer scientist, so somebody who does work in a very related area that was founded by Turing's work (use it almost daily). For a film that boasts that it is "based on a true story", it is a travesty to portray such a well- documented persons' life and the events related to this movie so inaccurately. The liberties taken by the film are so dishonest that nobody should use this as a factual story. Turing wasn't so simple to lay out, his papers are a testament to this.  If you want to get to know the actual story, get the actual biography the film is based off of, or even better (like I do), read his actual papers. I own most of them myself in collections from the 40's-50's. Go into this film to enjoy the acting, DO NOT use this as a real- true story tale. It has been demonstrated to be very inaccurate from the history of the Enigma to overshadowing Turing's most important contributions with emotional pleas that Turing held more as self-convictions than anything. He was a brilliant scientist, but this film just was so annoying as the inaccuracies got in the way. To make this blunt: This is the Patch Adams to films about mathematics and war. Totally inaccurate. I give it 1/10 because the acting is great, for what they're attempting to do. Truth-telling makes or breaks it for me, a computer scientist. If you're a young computer scientist or interested in this subject, get a more reliable source. Not this film.The best British movie I've saw in a long time! I went to see this movie at a screening. I have to admit, I went into this movie not knowing anything about Alan Turing and Enigma, but I love movies based on true events; especially those about the history of our country.  Despite not knowing anything about Mr. Turing or the events of his life, as soon as I left the movie theater, I went home and looked him up and spent the next few hours learning of his life, everything he did for this country and the invention of what we now call 'the computer'. I want to start by saying that Benedict Cumberbatch in this movie is outstanding. He plays Alan Turing perfectly; his accent, his movements and just the way he plays the character on screen is beautiful. I can honestly say that this is the performance of his career!  The movie focuses on different aspects of his life: it shows him and his team trying to break Enigma, it shows Young Turing during his time at boarding school, and the events after the war.  There's a quote at the beginning of the movie: "are you paying attention?". Throughout the movie, that's what I did. It's all that I could do because the story and the acting kept my eyes glued to the screen and I couldn't take them away. It's emotional, it's exciting and it is truly heartbreaking in some moments. It was a very comedic movie, too. There were some scenes that had me in fits of laughter and that's what makes it a beautiful script; despite the movie being based on the darkest days of World War 2, they added comedy into it which brought the movie alive.  I remember getting home and after researching Alan's life, I wanted to go back to the cinema and watch the movie again. It's rarely that happens to me but when this comes out in November, I will be straight to the cinema and purchasing a ticket to watch it.  I've heard reviewers mentioning that this film doesn't focus enough on Turing's homosexuality. Now, be that as it may, it focus' enough on the subject. Remember: this movie is about his mind, about the man himself. He was a genius!  This is the best British movie that I've saw in a long time, and it's probably one of the best movies that I've ever had the pleasure of watching, period.  I would recommend going to watch this movie when it comes out because it will take you into the world of Mr. Turing and the struggles and successes he made in his short life.Predictable and dull Cumberbatch played Alan Turing well, but I felt he was given almost same persona as he plays in Sherlock. His mannerisms were almost identical. This is where most of the 'laughs' in the film come from and as I had seen Sherlock before hand 70% felt like dull repeats.The fact that nobody was friends with him just reminded me of Sherlock - this was not true in real life. Secondary, the plot was almost identical to every other movie about a genius - Turring was played as unrecognized and an oddball. The plot also felt too smooth edged, all the twists were predictable and the events were too coincidental to be believable. The spy subplot was unnecessary and added nothing to the story. This may sound pedantic, but some parts seemed out of place for the historical setting: the detective's too modern haircut and lines such as "ohh my gosh" which really brought me out of the story. Finally, the ending scene was unnecessary and should have cut straight to the ending lines. Speaking of which, the last line inferred that the two things mentioned were linked, but they were in fact months apart. This is an example of the film's unreasonable twisting of facts in order to give the plot and conclusion this type of film needed. Should you wish to find out the real story of Alan Turing I suggest you google it as this film is not very accurate and unfairly stereotypes Turring.Stack of Lies It is a shame this movie is a stack of lies.First time polish broke enigma it was in 1932, 1933 they created first working example of Enigma, and first anti-enigma device, narrowing settings combination to 105 456. In 1936 Germans changed the design, and Polish answered with Rejewsky bomb, machine with 6 enigma connected together,breaking new daily code in 2 hours.Another German changes required building 54 different machine designs, and Poland didn't have enough money so they asked allies to help.July 1939 Uk and French representatives visited Warsaw and got all documentation how to break ENIGMA.After beginning of the war, polish encoders moved to Paris, and British started Bletchley Park operation. Unfortunately, Polish people are always forgotten, because they are not part of US/UK/France/Germany nation.Shame on you Britain.Breaking the code This film is supposedly based on the life of Alan Turing (adapted from a biography of his life). A pioneer in computer science, mathematician and cryptologist. During the war he as part of a team was involved in breaking the code, the Enigma Code that is. The character of Alan Turing tends to pop up in other novels and films usually in the periphery such as the Robert Harris fictional novel Enigma. The real Alan Turing's story had a tragic ending as he was arrested for homosexuality in the 1950s when it was illegal and committed suicide. Over the years pressure have been on to rehabilitate Turing's name. There is a road in Manchester named after him, his work in the field of computers and code-breaking in World War 2 eventually led to a posthumous pardon. The Imitation Game cast Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing and right from the early scenes we see our modern day Sherlock playing a genius like he was another Sherlock Holmes. Clever, insufferable, a loner, arrogant. I thought I would let that slide but the the script which has won the best adapted screenplay Oscar was I am afraid a ham-fisted clunker. It was determined to make the story uninteresting, dull and blah blah blah predictable. It is also probably far away from the actual true story. Just when you thought it was getting better it goes back to its default bad mode. For example when they do crack the code, the team start fighting and arguing and then one of them has a brother who just happens to be on a ship in the Atlantic which might get attacked. Then there is the communist double agent, but hold on there was a double agent in the fictional novel Enigma. It looks like that was added for dramatic effect. Then there is the ludicrous scene where the Commander and his cronies forcibly start to attack the code breaking machine having no idea what it does and wants to go back to manual code breaking when we have been already told that would take millions of years to succeed. It might had helped if it was explained to the audience how the machine worked. The real Turing also had a stutter which in this film is portrayed as being very mild. I much prefer Derek Jacobi's interpretation of Turing in the play and film, Breaking the Code where the stutter was more pronounced. The film is just clich√©d rubbish and I was genuinely disappointed as to how poor it was and that it got nominated for a Best Picture Oscar which is very much undeserved.Excellent This is THE movie for anyone who wants to learn about the birth of all modern computing and cryptography. It also provides a deep commentary on the ignorance of people who hate those who do not fit in. I wish the film could have gone into more detail about Alan Turing after the war when his deepest personal struggles were in full force. However, for a theatrical film it would have been far too long. This film illustrates how far we have come as a society in terms of accepting gay and lesbians and their contributions to society. I will not spoil the film but for the cypherpunks out there you will be a little uneasy if you compare the MI-6 tactics to those of today's NSA and other three letter agencies that spy on our every digital move. All in all a brilliant film with great actors that will move your hearts and minds.An extraordinary biography, flawlessly depicted On the verge of the second world war, a group of highly educated people are gathered in a desperate attempt of trying to break a complex encrypting machine, which the Germans used in their daily communications. Among them, a highly arrogant but brilliant mathematician decides to take matters into his own hands, thus not receiving much support from his colleagues. After much work and some intervention from an intelligent woman, he will create the first computer known to man, which will ultimately have to face the Enigma encryption machine. It's an excellent biography, which manages, with the help of its great cast, to deliver a very good imagining of the last part of Alan Turing's life, in which he manages to create one of the most important inventions of mankind. His troubled life is presented in-depth, with its many bumps and blockades which he must face in order to see his dream come to life, dream which will play a determinate role in the upcoming war. It's very trilling and suspenseful with a high dose of drama on top, a very good piece of cinematography, which totally deserves its academy awards.A well deserved tribute to a genius Although the truth and reality is something different , the story as such definitely deserved to make a movie about.Enigma was chacked by Polish mathematicians in 1932 Falsified history. Enigma was cracked years before WW2 by Polish mathematicians - in 1932. They cracked several versions of Enigma machine, they created mathematical models, a few versions of Enigma machine prototypes, basing only on encrypted data, and they created tools for decrypting messages. Suddenly Germans and Soviets attacked Poland and the possibility to continue their efforts has been lost, so they decide to get through to Great Britain to continue their efforts, and Alan Turing help them to create more powerful tools for cracking more advanced Enigma codes (brute force approach), but his participation was only partial. It was the great success of: Marian Rejewski, Henryk Zygalski, Jerzy R√≥≈ºycki mostly - not Alan Turing!Excellent film! What made this film great was the amazing performance by Benedict Cumberbatch.  I've read negative reviews based on the facts of this film. Where this did or did not happen is irrelevant... the writing was tight, as was the directing. Sure it was a little slow paced and felt too long, but nevertheless, it was a great film and very enjoyable. A 9/10 from me!Alan Turing ‚Äì Inventor of computers! I generally like the nerd nature. In this movie character played by Benedict Cumberbatch (Alan Turing) attracts you very much. The movie has a peculiar quality to keep you engaged till last. His bold nature in not caring much for anybody also attracts you. The movie than shows you about how Alan learns to behave with his other counter parts while gradually cracking the Enigma code. It's sad that the inventor of turing machines (computers) gradually commits suicide for he was being treated (medically) wrong. Highly Recommended.Not enough science This is a good flick. But if you are like me you started skipping the interpersonal stuff about halfway through. It would have been such a better flick if the gay agenda wasn't being pushed so hard. Okay, he was a sweet kid who fell in love with an older student. I can't help but wonder how he would have turned out in a school that wasn't all- boys. Some nice young girl might have taken him under her wing, and the rest of his life wouldn't have needed to be hidden. In either case, the interpersonal stuff was just in the way. Much more about the reasoning involved and the particulars of the development of his 'machine' would have made this so much better a motivating movie.Spoiler: The Nazis lost, but MI6 was almost as bad. Cheesy and inaccurate, but dramatic enough. The very fictionalized story of the man who paved the way for computers, if the film's end titles are to be believed. The film is well paced; there's plenty of suspense, incident and emotional turmoil. On the other hand, historical accuracy goes out of the window, if that's a problem for you when handing over your spondulicks. The inaccuracy that bothers me is the drama-class portrayal of emotional turmoil, the tearful confessions and crises, the repetition of encouraging catchphrases, and the billboard-sized depiction of what we have to assume is Turing's Asperger's syndrome. It's difficult to distinguish between Turing's struggle with having no friends, illegal sexuality (in the 40's) and his struggle to build an Enigma decoder, which makes him a joyless hero. And in the end, the government stitches him up royally - if only he'd known. What with the school bullying flashbacks, Benedict Cumberbatch has a tough time of it, and Turing's only happy moment seems to have been in finally getting 'Christopher', his computer, to work. I'm not asking for John Gregson or Kenneth More but it's all a bit wimpy and weepy. Gays, huh? What can you do? (Ironic). There's a lot of exposition of the fundamental problem of daily trying to find one out of 159,000,000,000,000 Enigma setting variations within 18 hours, which it's essential to appreciate to get the whole maguffin of the film, but this is well done, and on the whole the film is immersive and atmospheric. More exciting than, but easily as cheesy as you'd expect.preachy gay under plot. The Imitation Game, 2014. *Spoiler/plot- A 'bio-pic' covering a gay member of the British staff that broke the German "Enigma" machine military coding machine and it's complex language during WW2. The ethics of this complex situation is explored through the plot with the film's characters. *Special Stars- Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, Allen Leech. *Theme- Global issues can be coped with through honesty and professionalism. *Trivia/location/goofs- UK production. *Emotion- The heroic historic story of the WW2 Enigma machine and code breakers was interesting. The preachy gay under plot towards the film's end ruined the under plot for me. *Based On- The historic successful attempts to break the German military "Enigma" machine and codes by Allied mathematicians.Falls a bit short on a number of counts. With the excellent Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role, The Imitation Game is a movie that aspires to movie greatness, but I'm sorry to say, that in my humble opinion, it falls a bit short on a number of counts. It is the story of the brilliant scientist/mathematician, Alan Turing who was the man who almost single-handedly cracked the enigma code machine in the Second World War. This remarkable feat is generally acknowledged to have shortened the war by at least two years and saved thousands upon thousands of lives. It is also the story of a man who has been credited with the invention of the modern day computer. It is also the story of the man who was a homosexual, and who was prosecuted for committing (what were then considered to be) 'illegal' acts, and who subjected himself to state administered chemical castration rather than spend time in jail. It is also the story of a man who was treated so shabbily by the country who owed him so much that at the age of 39, he killed himself. It is a difficult story to tell in a couple of hours ‚Äì especially when we know nothing about the really exciting part ‚Äì the details of what exactly led up to Turing breaking of the enigma code during the war. We know he was hired to lead a team and he built and used a very primitive form of computer to break the code. More than that is still secret, or the records have long since been destroyed. The film writers decided to write what they thought was a clever piece of fiction in which Turing was continually fighting his bully- boy bosses; that his resentful, fellow workers all thought he was an idiot; that he was wasting valuable funds, and was probably a Russian spy. According to the film, he was at constant at risk of being fired. All the above is fiction. Indeed, they would have us believe that that it was only after Turing wrote directly to Churchill that he was put in charge and granted the funds to build his computer. (Fiction again.) It really is a load of tosh, and Charles Dance's role as Turing's ignorant, malevolent commanding Officer is so full of 'cartoon- evil', that for all the world, he comes across as a male manifestation of Creuella Deville. One of the most outrageous fictitious story lines concerns Turing's failure to report a Soviet spy to avoid being outed as gay. It is pure Hollywood invention, as are so many of the dramatic machinations that allegedly took place at Bletchley Park. It is a pity, as although I really don't like biopics unless they are very good ‚Äì this might have been an exception, but sadly it isn't. The film didn't seem to know what it wanted to do ‚Äì celebrate the genius of a man who shortened the war by two years and invented the computer, or show us how gays, even war heroes, were so appallingly treated by the authorities in Britain back in the early 50's. I think it tries to do both and falls a bit flat on both counts It is still a very watchable, entertaining movie, and Cumberbatch and Dance are always worth seeing ‚Äì whatever films they are in, as is the gorgeous Keira Knightley. But I don't think Benedict quite nailed the role ‚Äì maybe he tried a little too hard.  It just isn't that good. Honestly ‚Äì I've seen a couple of documentaries on Turing that are much better. Incidentally, it is a fact that Churchill later acknowledged Turing's massive contribution to the war effort, which shortened the war by at least two years, but no mention was made of the disgraceful way he was treated in the early 1950's because he was gay. Turing was recently pardoned by the then PM Gordon Brown for his 'crime' of being a practicing homosexual, but isn't it about time he was posthumously awarded a knighthood? After all, he is one of Britain's greatest ever heroes. If the likes of Cliff Richard, Mick Jagger and Bruce Forsyth and Angelina Jolie can become Knights and Dames of the Realm, then surely Alan Turing is equally deserving of the honour.embroidery an embroidery. more than a film. high attention to details. acting remembering a theater play. emotion in precise doses. and a drama who was build level by level to be a story without sin. touching, sure. but in a strange, specific manner. interesting portrait. but far to be more than cold and almost cryptic. a drama who could have status of parable - new skin, old recipes. the result - an embroidery. fascinating but well known. a pledge. not real comfortable. a life who has to many marks from a semi god's existence. a correct film. maybe, too correct. because the themes, the image of Turing, the acting of an actor to seem be the perfect piece for the perfect clock are virtues but not at all.Cumberbatch Performance Highlights Flawed Film Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent young British actor, who hits a home run in his latest film, The Imitation Game. Unfortunately, the film itself only makes it to second base. Morten Tyldum's The Imitation Game tells the fascinating story of British mathematician Alan Turing, who was hired by the British government to crack the Nazi code known as Enigma. Turing was later prosecuted for being a homosexual, and committed suicide in 1954. That's a lot of material to cover in one motion picture, and I wish Tyldum had stuck with the Enigma project. Originally, Turing is hired as part of a team of crack mathematicians and code breakers, but it doesn't take long for the others to turn against him. Brilliant yet socially awkward (reminding me of young Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything, which is a superior film), Turing has a habit of belittling those with whom he is assigned to work. He's simply not "one of the guys." Furthermore, he takes all conversation literally. Thus, not only can he not tell a joke, but he's not aware when others are joking with him. Colloquialisms are lost on Turing. This mental and social tug-of-war between Turing and his colleagues is one of the most interesting aspects of The Imitation Game. When Winston Churchill himself puts Turing in charge of the project, he promptly fires those he considers inferior, then holds a contest to find someone to replace them. That person is Joan Clarke, remarkably played by fellow Oscar nominee Kiera Knightley. Although her hairstyle is too modern for a World War II story, her character breathes fresh air into a story just beginning to wear thin when she arrives on the scene. Clarke develops a crush on Turing, and this is where we first learn of the homosexuality that would eventually lead to his personal downfall. Unfortunately, this takes place over halfway through the picture. Tyldum then spends so much time examining the homosexuality issue, the focus of the film abruptly changes. I believe The Imitation Game would have worked better had it either (a) made a statement about Britian's lack of respect for and understanding of homosexuals in the 1940s and '50s, or (b) given us an insider's look at how Alan Turing essentially invented the computer to break the Nazi radio code during the war. It has a hard time doing both. Personally, I found the codebreaking story more fascinating, and I wish more of an attempt had been made to help us understand some of the mathematics behind Turing's construction of the first computer. Then there's a side story about a possible Soviet spy working for Turing, but that plot strand is never developed. Another complaint I have with the script is that it moves too frequently among three time periods ‚Äì Turing's boarding school youth, the Enigma project itself, and the 1951 investigation into a break-in at Turing's home, which is used to bookend the story, albeit unnecessarily ‚Äì which adds to the confusion. I would have like to have seen all the boarding school scenes (which actually introduce us to Turing's homosexuality) first, then the Enigma project scenes. This structure worked great in The Godfather Part II. It would have worked great here. But all objections aside, Benedict Cumberbatch is exceptional as Alan Turing, fully capturing his genius and his social ineptitude. He's earned a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar, and probably should win it (but won't) over Michael Keaton's has-been actor in Birdman. Kiera Knightley also scores as Turing's sympathetic colleague. As I continue to compare The Imitation Game to The Theory Of Everything, I can't help but wonder if a similar approach would have helped The Imitation Game. In other words, what if the story were told from Joan Clarke's point of view, the way The Theory Of Everything was told from the viewpoint of Stephen Hawking's wife? I can't say for sure whether that story construction would have succeeded here, but if I were the director I'd be willing to give it a try.A great view at the origins of our computer based society In an age where my calculator has more processing power than the Apollo mission's computer system it becomes hard to imagine the origins of our modern computer systems. This movie does a phenomenal job of showing the intense thought and dedication that the Turing and his team go through as they try to break the Enigma Cipher. Since the movie is based on a true story it is easier to relate to the characters stories and what they are going through emotionally during their struggle. The story is very thought provoking because of how important computers are in our society, so thinking about the origin is wonderful. While watching this movie just think about all of the inventions and concepts that came out of this one concept, the modern computer, and the story becomes even more amazing.Whether you are an expert coder that has studied Turing and the Enigma machine or just like movies this is a great movie to watch.The Imitation Game was perhaps the best film of last year Me and my mom just watched this on Netflix disc and we both enjoyed this very much. It tells of Alan Turing's attempts at breaking the German Enigma code during World War II with his team of associates including a woman named Joan played by Keira Knightly. Both she and Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing deserved their Oscar nominations for their roles. Ms. Knightly is very touching and charismatic as the woman who seems to be one of the few people who could socialize with Alan on an equal basis. Turing's later tragic circumstances are heartbreaking especially when it's revealed how it all ended for him. Times were very different then as the Supreme Court ruling of the last few days can attest. In summary, me and Mom thought that this film, instead of Birdman, was the true Best Picture of last year.Masterpiece I watched this movie about a year ago and I can tell that it was one of the best films of its genre. Given that it is difficult to distinguish in dramas, horror and mathematical movies, The Imitation Game managed to do it. Amazing script, numerous quotes, exceptional lead actors. About the summary, the movie focuses on the story of Alan Turing, the person that will invent the computer. Since actions speak louder than words, I would prefer to let you watch it as well and then tell me your opinion about the movie, instead of letting you know every single detail of it. All in all, it is a movie that can be watched by all ages, it is intense,interesting and a movie that unfortunately came out a year that the Oscar competition was tough, consequently despite its worth it didn't won any significant Academy Award.Would rate it 11 if i could. This movie is a masterpiece, the storyline is on spot! Acting by Benedict cumberbatch is on spot! The movie depicts emotions of everybody in the best way possible. The ending, was a sad one really, when Alan is on the hormone control pills. Keira and Matthew also played a great role in the movie. This movie depicts the world war fairly well, even thought few parts of the movie can be a little hard to understand the first time you watch it.It is also great in the emotion depiction department, the quick variation of happiness and sadness keeps the movie fun at all times and does not get boring. The choice of background music is also perfect. This movie is undoubtedly one of my all time favorite. Overall, its a great movie to watch together with your close and loved ones. Completely worth the watch!!Intriguing, informative and important The role that the cryptologists at Bletchley Park played during WW II is well known - as is their contribution to the victory over Germany. What is less known is the "back story" of how it happened and who did it.  "The Imitation Game" is the story of the code breakers and the interpersonal and bureaucratic struggles they had to overcome to break the Enigma code. It also gives a very poignant snapshot of intolerance and ignorance which was typical of England (and America) at that time. Homophobia was the order of the day - actually being illegal in England. Alan Turing was a homosexual whose work and life were threatened, and then ruined by the prevailing attitudes of the day.  I was afraid that this would be the main point of the movie, but it was properly handled within the context of the greater story - the breaking of the Enigma code - and the ushering in of the computer age. The movie is a marvel - weaving in the eccentricities of Alan Turing - his arrogance - and peculiarities with the task he was called to accomplish. His homosexuality is tastefully handled as it is unveiled during his school boy days.  His lack of social graces is humorous, while showing how detrimental it was to his performance as part of a the team. He was extremely literal - as evidenced by his being responses to being invited to lunch one day. NOTE: he shares this literalness with Stonewall Jackson - ref Rebel Yell by S.C. Gwynne. The casting is brilliant - the performances are brilliant - especially Benedict Cumberbatch who plays Turing. He does not overplay his eccentricities - watching him makes you think you are really encountering this very strange genius. From a team building perspective it is interesting how he learned how to reach out to his team - and not alienate them.  One of the most frustrating things about the movie was seeing the close-mindedness of the establishment as exemplified by Charkles Dance who plays Commander Denniston - who is in charge of the Bletchley project. He clearly is dealing with non linear people and processes using a "military like" linear thought process and expectations. I am reminded of Salieri trying to keep up with Mozart in Amadeus. Fortunately, Turing and his associates had MI6, the British spy agency, on their side. Spooks do not think along standard lines either. The development of the machine which eventually breaks the Enigma code is very tense, especially when they discover the (typically German) method of signing on and off in their coded messages. The "Heil Hitler" at the end of each code was symptomatic of how damaging mindless obedience to Hitler and the tenants of Nazism was to Germany itself.  Finally the conundrum which the breaking of the code placed the Bletchley team in was very intriguing. Recognizing that the fact that the German messages were being decrypted was a crucial secret. Knowing when to use the knowledge of where and when the Germans were going to attack was the result of a ratio of the importance of the military action against the probability that the action would tip the Germans off that the code had been compromised. This sets up one of the greatest ethical dilemmas in the war. As a result, Churchill let Coventry be bombed - with the loss of many lives. Yet the information from Enigma was used to great effect at Stalingrad (THE turning point of the war); in D-Day; and in the Mediterranean. As you can see- there is much to recommend this film. Great story, great performances, great insight into the era it took place. If you have not seen it, you should.Great viewing. Personally, I thought this was a film rated my highest score, and unfortunately was against 'The Theory ...' and Stephen Hawking life is well known and probably just pipped Benedict's performance at the 2015 Academy Awards. I knew nothing of this man's contribution to the war effort and his time at Bletchly Park. But I can understand the Official Secrets Act shrouded lots of involvement during this time, and is now only being released for the public domain. Not all though. What was interesting though was when they first realized that a convoy of ships was going to attacked and did nothing, so their secret would not be revealed to the enemy, i.e., that they'd cracked the German code. It opens debate also about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The British warned the Americans that the Japanese Fleet was heading their way. The Americans did nothing or seemed not to take precautions against this intelligence. Churchill was relieved when they attacked knowing that America would now join the war. Strange that some of the carriers were out at sea at the time, and spared destruction. Unfortunately as with most intelligence and wars, the public only know half the story, and only what the government of the day want them to know. However, it was a great movie and it did admit some of the events depicted were dramatized etc., based or inspired by a true story, that's entertainment folks, it was NOT a documentary."Sometimes it's the very people who know and imagines anything of, who do the things that no one can imagine" This is a very entertaining, compelling and impactful movie that is based on a true story. There has been quite a lot of war movies where soldiers fight with weapons to win battles and such. So it's refreshing to see a group of nerds, using there brains to save lives. Now I really enjoy stories where a group of interesting people with special set of skills come together as a team to pursue the same goal. Except this time it's a group of code breakers trying to decyper the Nazis code of communication called Enigma during World War 2. The plot which is based on a true story is very well put together. And that includes Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) past and where he comes from. Now portraying a characters past can sometimes make the movie drag, but in this it actually adds to the movie and helps it lead to a more impactful ending. There is quite a bit of depth to this movie without it going all over the place or it being overly convoluted. Benedict Cumberbatch was just phenomenal playing Alan Turing. Which shows that you don't necessarily have to look like a real life person to make the character believable. Matthew Goode was sharp and sturdy as Hugh Alexander. And Keira Knightley fit her role really well as Joan Clarke and the chemistry between her and Alan really added a sense of humanity to the plot. This sort of reminded me of "Valkyrie" which is another film based on a true story about heroic people that did there best to try and stop Hitler and his plans. Except I felt more emotion with this one because of the way it was executed. Overall, this is a film that I would highly recommend to anyone. I say full price. 9/10Awesome The imitation game is about the life of Alan Turing. Turing was a brilliant boy. He helped cracking a Nazi code. Turing is played by Bennedict Cumberbatch who did an amazing job. Keira Knightleiy was also amazing acting preformace. I really loved her character. The plot of the movie is really good and well executed. It surprised me that it was based on a true story. And it made me feel sadder when I realized that Alan really committed suicide. And that gay people where handled like th√°t, is just horrible But now something more about the script. I absolutely loved the scrip. The begin line of Bennedict was a really good start of the movie. The lines said by the kid actor who portraits Alan are also really good. The kid actor is also something I liked, because the kid actor is a really good actor for his age. The directing is just... Wow. The director made the movie so beautiful. If I have to say something that bothered me (but didn't make the movie worse) where the special effects, like the planes and stuff. But the bombed city looked good.  And now my favorite parts of the movie. The moment when they made Christopher work, and the figured everything out where so good. Overall this is an amazing movie and I recommend watching it.Overall A Well-made Biographical Dramatic Thriller I caught this film at the local multi-plex earlier this year. After my sister was telling me how great it was, my dad and I are sitting in the theater watching about the first half hour, and bored out of our gords! LOL BUT...skip ahead to after that first half hour, and very exciting movie!  Benedict Cumberbatch stars as British cryptanalyst Alan Turing, who is hired to decrypt German intelligence codes for the British government during World War II. I kept thinking of "Big Bang Theory" throughout most of this film- with Turing being Sheldon; Joan Clarke (Keira Knightly) being Penny; and then you've got the other three blokes-?? LOL  I also managed to look up some of the real history involved with this story. Turing, it turns out, got along well with his colleagues- was considered to have a good sense of humor. The code-cracking team was not who decided when/where to use the info against the Germans- that was done by higher-up admins. Turing never named his machine after his school chum. And Clarke's family commented about the casting of Knightley as their family member- describing her as "rather plain". LOL THEIR words.. LOL  But no matter- this is a great story- both a socio-political as well biographical one--as well as the origin story of perhaps the greatest invention of the modern era... Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear and Charles Dance also star.Sometimes the people no one imagines,Comes great things no one can ever imagine. the Imitation Game is one of those movies that surprises you and impresses you. It also has the ability to educate you about things you never knew. Or things you never learned in school. When I was in high School my science Teacher's idol was Alan Turing. He kept talking about the Turing machines and we learned about Alan Turing briefly. 30 years later I've forgotten about Alan Turing. Which is a shame because his life story really is a fascinating one. Alan Turing was a unequaled genius at codes and machines built to think . When he went to Bletchely park to get a job breaking the enigma code. Turing did not think too highly of the War. What he wanted was the challenge of smashing enigma. Turing was too great of a genius to let that code remain unbroken for long. the film details how hard life was for him. alone and with few friends.It details greatly how Turing was . And when the war ended and the team dissolved Turing turned his attentions to more machines that would work miracles. Until a break in accidentally leads to Turing's greatest secret revealed. his homosexuality. In a era where that was a Crime Alan Turing was arrested and charged with indecency. And this led to his suicide at the age of 41. The movie is powerful. subtle in ways you do not see coming. and truthful. Cumberbatch gives the performance of a lifetime and bring Alan Turing back to life . This isn't a war movie by any means . Its a movie about a lonely man struggling to find his way in the world. In a age where Autistic people where dismissed as retarded and homosexuals arrested. Alan Turing overcame all of that to become a hero and a icon for all the lonely people out there who do not fit in. Bravo to all involved with the making of this film. You have made a classic and a movie to be watched over and over .Among the Best of 2014, Don't miss it! I really like films from this era, and this one is no exception. I also like these troubled genius type movies. Turing's story is absolutely fascinating, and probably one of WW2's best kept secrets up until now. I really appreciate learning about something of such great historical relevance. Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent actor, and he did an impeccable job in this film. I thought he was great in Star Trek 2, but in this film he played a totally different character, and he played it to perfection. Keira was also impressive, though this was hardly her best work - how can she ever top her performance in Pride and Prejudice? However, she is still a joy to watch. Can a movie that just relies on an awesome script and talented actors still be good without CGI and pyrotechnics? Absolutely! There wasn't a boring minute in this film. I don't know if The Imitation Game was the best film of 2014, but it was certainly among the best and is well worth seeing.Good historical drama Good historical drama. The story of Alan Turing, the man who, in World War II, lead the team that cracked Germany's Enigma Code. His efforts went a long way to winning the war. The machine he developed to crack Engima was revolutionary, resulting in him being regarded as the father of computing. However, it's not all about this feat. Turing was homosexual and we see how this affects his life, especially post-WW2. Overall, a decent examination of the impact of this gifted man on society, with sub-plot on intolerance and injustice. Good performance by Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role and by Keira Knightley. Both received Oscar nominations. Good support from Mark Strong, Charles Dance and Matthew Goode. Not a perfect movie though. Many of the details feel over- simplified and Hollywoodized. The military side, especially, is very simplistically told. This leaves the movie feeling a bit superficial and a bit too neat. Plus, for something that is one of the main plot points, his personal life seems to only get a passing mention, and only really comes to the fore towards the end. A longer movie, with a more detailed study of the man, was in order, I think. This said, what we have is very good, and surely enough to spark the curiosity of anyone with even a mild interest in history.compute everything to win I had heard of Alan Turing for some years before "The Imitation Game" got released. I knew that his work in code-breaking led to modern computing, and that he got prosecuted when the authorities found out about his homosexuality. Having seen the movie, I'm impressed. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the role perfectly (my favorite scene is when Turing figures out how to crack the Enigma), with fine support from Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, who finally gets the recognition that she deserves. Screenwriter Graham Moore's comment about bullying while accepting accepting his Oscar was exactly what needed to get said (as were Laura Poitras's comment about surveillance, Patricia Arquette's comment about the wage gap, John Legend's comment about mass incarceration and Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu's comment about immigration). There's no doubt that Alan Turing's government betrayed him, even after he helped them achieve their greatest victory. After it got announced that Queen Elizabeth planned to grant Turing a royal pardon, Stephen Fry said that Turing shouldn't have to get pardoned, since he didn't do anything wrong; instead, Fry proposed, Turing belonged on money. I agree. No one should forget what Turing did for the world, and everyone should see "The Imitation Game". I wonder what all the bigots who comment on articles dealing with LGBT issues just so that they can write homophobic things would think if they knew that they wouldn't even be using those computers if not for a gay man.I AM NOT A SPY. I'M A MATHEMATICIAN The geek in me loved this film. This is a biography of Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), told with flashbacks. The film opens in 1951 where he has experienced a break-in. As the police investigate this man, we flashback to his work on cracking the Nazi code as well as his time as a student in 1928. The film brings out the genius and unusual character of Alan as he leads a team to build a machine to crack the Enigma code. Alan must keep all kinds of secrets, both personal and at a government level. It is estimated this man who received no recognition during his lifetime saved 14 million lives and shortened the war by two years. While I have heard the name Turing as the inventor of the modern computer during WWII, I had no notion about the man behind it. Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Good geek film.Great as a film, annoying as a true story Brilliant soundtrack, well edited, well written, well acted, and good pacing to maintain a good level of emotional engagement. Its very watchable and exciting.  But there's something deeply frustrating about the decisions behind the screenplay. It clearly focuses on Turing's unfair persecution for being gay - this is the tragic element that we're left with as an audience. Which is absolutely worth a story, for sure. But if that's your angle, then why did they focus on enigma/bombe and miss out so much of his contribution to modern computing? They make out he pretty much worked alone on designing/building/running the bombe (called Christopher in the film) which is just unnecessarily false.  I'm still waiting on a decent film or mini-series to portray the incredible events of what happened at Bletchley during the war:   it was truly a collaborative effort. Gordon Welchman has just as much input as Turing on the bombe machine, which was first invented by the Poles anyhow, and built by engineers at Letchworth. There were eventually many bombe machines - not just one that Turing seemingly built with his own hands in a hangar-sized 'hut' (the huts were a lot smaller).    The whole design/point of the bombe was to exploit a flaw in the enigma, requiring a 'crib' - a known phrase like 'heil hitler' used in the film, which they could match up alongside the cypher to extract patterns. The film delivers this discovery as a eureka moment at the bar, well after Turing has built the bombe! Which makes no sense and is confusing to the viewer as to what the original intentions of the machine actually were.    The film implies there was a spy in Turing's team. Really - is this kind of cinematic device really necessary to keep audiences engaged? Was the REAL story not interesting and exciting enough?! When told properly at least.    There are far more angles to the story - how so many misfits/outliers were brought together to collaborate on genius ideas, with huge determination and drive. The idea that the seemingly impossible can be achieved. Its a really inspiring moment of history that should surely be pushed more in today's world.   Its a great film ciematically, but its annoying how the personal agenda of the book's author and film's screenwriters biased the film away from truth towards one aspect of Turing's life, and in doing so failed to really do either angle as much justice as was deserved. It might have also been fitting to have shown how much sexual abuse happened at Sherborne school when/where Turing attended, which continued well through the 20th century according to well researched documentaries and reports, but I guess that's not quite as pleasing for sunday afternoon cinema audiences.Gripping from start to finish This is a great film. When I saw the trailer for it I was worried I would get bored at one point because this usually isn't my type of movie. But because of Benedict Cumberbatch's outstanding performance I was gripped from start to finish. I wasn't very familiar with the story of Alan Turing but I knew he cracked the Enigma and had to hide that he was gay for many years. But that was pretty much all I knew. The film enthralled me. I payed attention to every single thing that happened in this movie. And that payed off at the end. At the end of the film some text appears telling us that Alan Turing committed suicide through cyanide poisoning after undergoing Chemical Castration for 2 years. When this happens you see the team throwing their work into a fire whilst cheering and laughing. This ultimately made the film even more emotional. Through Cumberbatch's incredible performance you really see how attached he becomes to his machine "Christopher" and it was truly emotional to watch I have to recommend this too everyone interested in history or film in generalWhat a stunning and true sad story What an amazing story about Alan Turning's life in WW2 and committing suicide after suffering with anti gay meds.Doesn't focus on the code-breaking quite as much as you'd expect, but trades this for an insight into the tragic treatment of its historical hero. 'The Imitation Game (2014)' doesn't actually focus on the apparent focal code-breaking machine, or indeed its making, as much I'd have liked, instead choosing to spend much more time on a man who was severely wronged by the government he so strongly served. This might have been more down to expectation and preference, considering the machinations of the device are fascinating to say the least, than anything else, though, since the slight bait-and-switch is actually a welcome one. It allows for a much more personal stake in all of the action, though the balance could have perhaps been a little finer. What we have is, for the most part, a character study on a figure so often noted yet perhaps equally misunderstood. The flick is an interesting and tragic insight into his unfair and borderline inhumane treatment. It is engaging for its duration, even if it can be a tad slow and sometimes slightly strangely structured. 7/10Not 100% accurate, but a brilliant representation of Alan Turing's life. After watching The Kings Speech I grew more interested in watching wartime/period dramas, this one was excellent. Yes it may not be 100% accurate but it is still a great film with a gripping story-line. Knightley and Cumberbatch have done a fantastic job with this film.  Strong 8/10Passionate This movie shows two plot trends: one is the runnning against time to discover the secret code of the Nazi militar messages led by a group of cryptoanalysts during WWII under the direction of Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician and the other is the latter's dramatic life and feelings as an homossexual at a time when that behaviour was a crime in Great Britain and for which he is later convicted. His success at that cryptoanalysis work is kept secret which prevents him to be recognized as a hero who has largely contributed to shorten the war time and thus saving millions of lives. Besides that he is always being harassed by his superiors to deliver quickly that code decipherment. By the way this story is based on real events. The movie shows all this in detail in a way that passionates the viewers in terms of good cinema direction and acting performance.Meh, not very interesting to me Reading the Wikipedia page on Alan Turing and his invention was more captivating than watching this movie. Watched based on a friend's recommendation. Would have liked to see more of how the "bombe" was designed and how it worked. Basically skipped through all of the emotional fluff, it was predictable and overemphasized. Didn't feel like the characters developed in a very natural way even though the film is nearly 2 hours long. Perhaps I had the wrong expectation.Excellent Performances and Strong Story The Imitation Game (2014)  **** (out of 4) Excellent mixture of drama and thriller takes place during WWII where mathematician Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) is hired by the British government to try and break Hitler's enigma code, which could lead to the war ending. Throughout the drama of trying to break the code, Turing begins a relationship with a co-worker (Keira Knightley) while trying to keep his homosexuality a secret. THE IMITATION GAME is without question one of the best movies of the year and it works on so many levels. It's rather sad to think that Turing wasn't better known or respected during his short life time and it's even sadder when one realizes why he didn't live very long. I'm not going to spoil any of these true-story events but I think what I respected most about this picture is that it managed to give a strong message without having to preach. More on that in a bit but the film also contains some of the best drama you're going to see and some incredible performances that bring it all together. Cumberbatch turns in one of the strongest performances of his career in a very challenging role. The Turing character is one you hate at times. Egotistical. Mean-spirited. Caring. A mad genius if you will. There's so much going on with this character and his brain is racing a mile a second yet Cumberbatch manages to keep all of this stuff under control and give a very memorable performance. What was so remarkable about it is that he's playing a genius and he really makes you feel as if you're watching the real guy and seeing these events unfold in front of your eyes. There's a sequence towards the end of the film where we see Turing crumbling and just the look in Cumberbatch's eyes are unforgettable. Knightley turns in another terrific performance proving why she's one of the best actresses out there. Matthew Goode, Matthew Beard, Rory Kinnear and Tom Goodman-Hill are all wonderful as well. Director Morten Tyldum does a wonderful job at taking the various aspects of the story and making them all work. The screenplay jumps around from the events in WWII to Turing's childhood and then his later years. The subplot dealing with a detective trying to break Turing is extremely well-balanced with the rest of the film. Usually when films jump around like this you can lose certain bits of tension but that never happens here. Even more impressive is the wonderful music score, the excellent cinematography and some wonderful costumes. On a technical level the film is quite flawless and even the CGI isn't bad looking even though it's rarely used. Getting back to the preaching, it's rather sad to see what happened to Turing and there's certainly a political and social message here. A lot of films really would have beaten the viewer over the head but instead this film just lets it sink in that this brilliant man was cut short for the dumbest of reasons. It's rather sad to think of what could have been with this genius and the film makes you think of that. THE IMITATION GAME is certainly one of the year's strongest films.The Enigmatic Man The British Official Secrets act prevented me as a kid growing up about Alan Turing. I would certainly have liked to know about him in my formative years on many levels. Over a 100 years after his birth he's a role model for gay geeks everywhere, but in his lifetime he would not have been known beyond his field of Mathematics. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the enigmatic man Alan Turing who many consider the founder of computer science. He was also a tortured gay man in those days when sodomy laws were strictly enforced. A respected professor of Mathematics he volunteers for the war effort. Not satisfied with how codebreaking efforts were going he goes right to the top and the sheer brass and effrontery persuade Winston Churchill to put this man in charge. I doubt Winston Churchill knew much more about what Alan Turing was talking about than I would now. But sometimes genius will out in just the way it's presented. I only wish we had gotten to see Churchill's reaction to Turing's now famous letter. As we well know now with what has been declassified how Turing and his picked crew broke the Nazi code and with some well used and specific intelligence at propitious moments we were able to win the war in Europe. Part of that crew is Keira Knightley who wins a battle for feminism to be accepted in this all male bastion.  Keira and Ben's scenes have some real emotion to them. He confesses he's gay and she would still like to marry him as fascinated as she is by his sheer intellect. Cumberbatch made the right decision as so many gay men today still make the wrong one. He decides that marriage will just spread the heartache he has in not being able to live openly and proudly with whom he loves. For her role Keira Knightley got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. When different players play the same individual at different stages of life I've thought that some recognition is due. In flashback scenes to Turing's prep school days we see the understated but beautifully played romantic involvement of Alex Lawther as young Turing and Jack Bannon as Christopher Morcum. Those two juveniles are nothing short of magnificent in what they do with the part. Young Morcum's death while still in prep school was a secret heartache he carried for the rest of his life. The Imitation Game got several other Oscar nominations including Best Picture and took home one Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. The saddest thing about Alan Turing is that he's one of a handful of people who ever existed of whom it could be said he bent the course of history and in his life he could receive no recognition for it. In fact we do see what did happen to him post World War II. Now his nation and the world can appreciate him for what he was and what he did.That 'The Imitation Game' was so acclaimed is hardly an enigma at all Alan Turing was a fascinating, complex person who deserves to be better known to the world. Likewise his story is important and deserves to be told rather than forgotten. Had high hopes for 'The Imitation Game', after hearing so many good things about it, and it ended up being one of my favourite films of 2014. That 'The Imitation Game' is historically inaccurate and has distortions didn't offend me as much as some reviewers, biographical dramas are notorious for this so it's come to be expected by me (not that that is meant to be an excuse). All that was wanted was a film that made me think, moved me, was well made and well acted. 'The Imitation Game' was all those things and more. It isn't perfect, the political elements are on the preachy side and there are a few strands that could have gone into more detail, Turing's sexuality should have gotten into more depth than it was. However, 'The Imitation Game' is exceptionally well made. It's immaculately photographed and has some of the best production design of its best, especially in the costumes. The direction allows the film to be absorbing, while the music score is often hauntingly beautiful and never intrusive. In terms of the script, 'The Imitation Game' does a wonderful job in provoking thought and providing emotional impact and nuances and fleshes the characters out with remarkable complexity. What could have been potentially dry treatment of the subject matter turned out to be fascinating, thrilling and very moving. Benedict Cumberbatch gives his best performance of a very solid career, an outstanding portrayal that won't be forgotten for years to come. Keira Knightley is a sympathetic confidante and Charles Dance is excellent as always as his superior. The supporting cast are without complaint. Overall, wonderful film and its acclaim is a long way from an enigma. 9/10 Bethany CoxExemplary film-making THE IMITATION GAME is an excellent piece of cinema that proves that there's still an audience for mature, thought-provoking drama. This is British cinema at its finest: superbly written and acted, which tells a series of historical events in an involving way that covers the broad spectrum of cinema. I love the background of spying and code-breaking so this film's subject matter was right up my street. Alan Turing is a portrayed as a tragic genius character, and Benedict Cumberbatch - although not one of my favourite actors - is perfect in the part. He delivers a character full of quirky mannerisms, whose sheer resistance to normality and likability makes him likable in himself. The two-hour running time flies past and every scene involved in the film adds to something. Norwegian director Morten Tyldum, who previously made the equally fantastic HEADHUNTERS, shows himself to be a powerful film-making force. The supporting cast are also great, in particular an irascible Charles Dance, MI6 head Mark Strong (thankfully not typecast as a baddie), and Matthew Goode (WATCHMEN) and Allen Leech (ROME) as Turing's companions. By turns moving, gripping, exciting, and heartbreaking, THE IMITATION GAME is a cinematic tour-de-force.functional historical drama lands a couple of solid punches As the war starts, mathmatician professor Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) arrives at Bletchley Park under the militarist Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) to break the German Enigma code. He is joined by math student Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) and chess genius Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode). Stewart Menzies (Mark Strong) is from the secret MI6. The movie also takes place in 1927 with Alan as a student and Christopher Morcom as his only friend and love. In 1951, police detective Robert Nock (Rory Kinnear) investigates Alan for being a Soviet spy but discovers that he's only guilty of homosexuality. The first half of the movie is a rather traditional historical drama. Cumberbatch is impeccable. Knightley is too much of a starlet. Of course, Denniston is a military blowhard. Turing's homosexuality is limited. It all has the feel of a sanitized docudrama. Then the movie starts landing some solid punches. I love the Hugh Alexander character. Alan and Christopher's relationship is pretty compelling. There is nothing physical but they do use the word love. Menzies is another great character. Alan's confession to detective Nock is riveting and poignant. It's missing his suicide scene. This vehicle started out functional with a couple of squeaky wheels and then it makes a few great turns.A good tale with a fine lead performance, even if it doesn't delve into details, or worry too much about historical accuracy I watched another film about the Enigma code recently, and it reminded me that I had not yet seen this one. It is a story I was broadly aware of ‚Äì not to the point of having read the book, but certainly knowing the general sweep of the events. In a way this does suit the film, because it does brush across the main events in the life of Turning, rather than really delve too deeply into specifics. So we get key childhood moments, the stresses and moral conundrums of breaking the code, and of course his horrific treatment and death due to his sexuality. With this approach the film is actually very well structured as it mixes the global and the personal, as well as combining several running time periods (in a nicely edited construction). As such it is a solid and engaging story, which manages to fold together the central impact made by Turning, the roots of some of his character, and the sad treatment of him at the (early) end of his life. Of course as with any biopic, the film runs a lot together, simplifies wherever it can, and I guess probably will bother those that know the source material / real story inside out (as these things always do). For me I am always happy for such sacrifices being done in the name of a good story, just so long as the film does a good job of telling that story (it is not a documentary, and there are plenty of sources for that). In the case of this film, I think it works, because it is well told and engaging. The lead performance from Cumberbatch is the hook that a lot of it hangs on. He is convincing in his awkward difficultness but yet genius. He is perhaps not particularly well supported by Knightley, although to be fair this is not just down to her but perhaps more to do with how generic her character is. Outside of these two, the supporting turns are solid from those such as Kinnear, Strong, Dance, Goode, Leech, and others. Production values are high throughout, and the direction manages to get a lot of tension out of people in a room thinking ‚Äì which is pretty hard to deliver as a cinematic experience. All told, it is a handsomely crafted film, with a fine lead performance, and a story that, although probably greatly simplified, is well told and engaging.Okay film, mostly interesting for its historic references "The Imitation Game" was one of the big players in the 2014 awards season mounting in a Best Adapted Screenplay win at the Academy Awards. I have to say that I strongly disagree with this decision. The script may have been the weakest part of the movie. While it occasionally delivers and even shines, it also hits the lowest lows from all the factors that contributed to this film. Especially the beginning is extremely weak. The first 15-20 minutes only have one purpose: shows us what an unlikeable and antisocial character Turing is. And it does so, with zero subtlety. It is as much uninspiring and in your face in an equally embarrassing manner as Graham Moore's Oscar speech was. Sorry, but screaming out to the world that you tried to kill yourself decades ago is just as low as it gets. But back to the movie. Turing fires a couple people he deems unqualified and acts arrogantly by saying that employing him is the only way to find out if the Nazi code can be really cracked. The whole movie is about decoding secret messages, so you would expect that the script would have at least a little bit reading between the lines and subtlety. For the most part, it did not. Then there is another problem with this whole story. Everything about it was a well-kept secret for a very very long time, so you could wonder how much about it is really accurate and how much is merely fictitious. One fictitious point is that decoding the system won the War as this film tries to tell us. What mostly won the war was German soldiers succumbing to the cold Russian winter, which is not mentioned a single time. However, there is a Russian spy sub-plot included, an inclusion that this film did not really need and the only thing I liked about it is how people actually knew about him. Interesting counter-intelligence reference. Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley (with some comedic delight) gave decent performances, but it was nothing they hadn't shown in previous performances already, so I disagree with the two Academy Award nominations. "Sherlock" and Assange had pretty much everything already that Cumberbatch delivered here. Among the parts that I liked about the film was pretty much everything at the end. The scene where we see the two characters meet again and Turing suffering from his medication was very well done (much better than when he pushed her away in boring stereotypical manner minutes before) and so was the final shot when they burn their work after they succeeded. I also really liked the fact that they had to hide that they cracked ENIGMA in order to avoid letting the Nazis know. But even with this stroke of genius, the script failed again when they decided to randomly include a relative of the team being killed and they could do nothing against in in the grand scheme of things. Just completely unrealistic this coincidence, very cringeworthy. Easily the best part of the film is Morten Tyldum's direction. It would have been a lot worse without his great approach here and I'm glad to see he got the Oscar nomination. Great breakthrough for him. He was unknown outside of Scandinavia before his work here. Alexandre Desplat managed another Score nomination for his work here and won the category, even if for another film. Special mention to Charles Dance who played his small role perfectly. Also Matthew Goode was in here and there are talks he may become the next James Bond. On the flashback scenes, I am not entirely sure if I liked them. I thought the Christopher reference was interesting, but they could have kept these shorter. Oh yeah, and another criticism about the script: There is absolutely no way that some of the smartest men of Great Britain would need a random comment from a female friend in order to find out that "Heil Hitler" is in every decoded message, especially with the two H's at the beginning every time. That was just unrealistic. Same can be said about a Russian spy being stupid enough to get caught by letting his Bible just lie around somewhere. One part that was very much in the face, initially funny, but quickly repetitive was how Turing was only able to decode the factual message his co-workers told him and did not realize for example they were asking him to grab a bite with them. All in all, it is an okay movie, mostly worth for its historic value (if accurate), but it's nowhere near the best of the year or deserving the accolades it received except Tyldum's direction.Excellent Dramatic Thriller Based on a True Story During the World War II, the mathematician Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) joins a team of code-breakers at top-secret facility at Bletchley Park to try to decipher the code of the German enigma machine. Turing is a homosexual genius and along two years, he and his team successfully develop another machine to decipher the enigma. "The Imitation Game" is an excellent dramatic thriller based on a true story. About twelve years ago I saw another good movie ("Enigma 2001) about a team of cryptanalysts put together to break the code of the German enigma. "The Imitation Game" is a superior version, with magnificent screenplay and performances. The plot is based on highlights of Alan Turing's biography (see the Wikipedia) entwined with fictitious facts to give the necessary pace and keep the attention of the viewers. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Jogo da Imita√ß√£o" ("The Imitation Game")Amazing Storytelling During World War II, mathematician Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) tries to crack the enigma code with help from fellow mathematicians. Some people have complained about the accuracy of this film, particularly that the Poles are not given the credit they deserve. That is fair, but the bottom line is that you have to sacrifice 100% accuracy in order to make for a good story. And this is a very good story, full of moral ambiguity. A philosophy class could have a field day with how many ethical issues are presented: the war, hiding the code, destroying records, chemical castration... Cumberbatch did a superb job and if he was not already on people's radars, this will put him there. In a year with Eddie Redmayne doing a spot-on Stephen Hawking and an incredible buzz around Michale Keaton (for some unclear reason), this is not an Oscar year for him. But as a whole, this seems a real contender for Best Picture, or at the least Best Screenplay.Take It as a Tale of an Amazing Man, Even Though it May Have Some Suspect History This is the story of Allen Turing, who really existed. He is the mathematical genius who was engaged to try to break the German code "Enigma" during World War II. He is autistic and humorless, totally insensitive, with no regard for social interaction. He is driven by the task at hand and feels other things are superfluous. He is also under the gun from a commandeer who he insulted and who would love to be rid of him. Had his colleagues not reluctantly come to his aid when he was under attack, he would never have been able to do the work he did. He has one other problem. He is homosexual and at this time this is illegal and would get him drummed out of service and probably imprisoned. There are flashbacks of his youth, made horrible by his peers. It shows his relationship with Christopher, a boy whom he loves, the one person who gives him his due and his respect. Something terrible occurs after a school vacation, and Alan is left alone. The acting is quite incredible. Benedict Cumberbatch is turning into a major actor (to the chagrin of the "Sherlock" fans). Keira Knightly does a nice job as the female foil, who even agrees to marriage with Alan (although it is utterly doomed by his own admission). One of the stars is an amazing computer that Alan puts his life and heart into, designed to break the aforementioned code. It spins and clicks. For many, this was the first real modern computer (for all you abacus fans, I don't mean to be disrespectful). This is the story of another genius (keep in mind the current film about Stephen Hawking) who experiences heartbreak at every turn, whose peers hate but tolerate him. It's the story of a society that devalues a man because of the way he was born, that dismisses his accomplishments. There are two really emotional scenes. One is when he throws himself in front of his computer (which is named after his friend Christopher) as the military Philistines start to destroy it. And a scene with the headmaster of his school when Alan must say he barely knew the boy whom he loved. See this. One of the best films of 2014.Secrets, All Kinds of Secrets. It's difficult to show Benedict Cumberbatch, as Alan Turing, trying to figure out how to break the German Enigma code during World War II, just as it's difficult to show the effort being put into any cognitive enterprise. That's the trouble with making movies about writers, puzzle solvers, and chess players. You can't show them as action figures, shooting up a place, killing enemies by the thousands, wrenching heads off. The result is that you wind up concentrating on the drama of the personality itself. The protagonist's social relations, his triumphs and tribulations, his strengths and weaknesses. This one begins in 1951 with the oddball Cumberbatch dismissing the police from his room after an apparent break in, but we're soon back to 1939, with Cumberbatch newly out of Cambridge and recruited by "MI-6", which doesn't exist and is devoted to the breaking of Enigma at the famous Bletchley Park. The introductory scenes are sometimes amusing. Cumberbatch, always polite, seems to have no sense of humor and interprets expressions literally. His handful of colleagues stand up at noon and ask if Cumberbatch is hungry too. "Yes, I'm hungry, he replies, but he doesn't get up and join them because no one asked him to. They only asked him if he was hungry. When a colleague comes up with a useful suggestion, his way of saying thank you is, "That's not an entirely terrible idea."His artlessness is taken for arrogance and he's generally disliked except for one of his brilliant young colleagues, Keira Knightley. (Lucky him.) He likes her too but not for her contours because he turns out to be a pouf. That was a serious crime in England until 1967. Instead of trying to figure out how Enigma's decoding machine worked -- Polish scientists had brought one to England -- he decided to build a machine that would defeat the machine. Promoted to head of the department at Bletchley, he recruited more members for his team by publishing a crossword puzzle in the newspapers. "If you can solve this puzzle in ten minutes or less call this number for an exciting and rewarding career." And the tradition of British crossword puzzles is that they are notoriously hard. "Name a seed you put in the garage." (Caraway.) "Name a major seaport in the middle of Czechoslovakia." (Oslo.) Those are examples from a recent edition of the London Times. The head honcho at MI-6 despises Cumberbatch and his gang and is just about to shut the whole affair down when there occurs a "Man in the White Suit" moment. Bingo. The first German encrypted message is disencrtyped by Enigma which, with a bang, turns from a huge, noisy, whirling machine into a silent and obedient servant, standing at attention and waiting for more orders. It IS a big machine too, affectionately named Christopher. It would take up half a garage. I'm glad they didn't go too deeply -- or at all, in fact -- into decoding. I never got past Sherlock Holmes and the Dancing Men. Cumberbatch does fine by the role of the eccentric Alan Turing. He's extremely amusing when he's trying to humanize himself by telling a joke that he doesn't really get. Keira Knightley is Keira Knightly, she of the exquisite iliac crests. Nobody in the supporting cast delivers a weak performance. The story switches without any jolts between 1928, 1941, and 1951, and it follows a familiar trajectory. Someone who is a genius at something, whether maths, the trumpet, or baseball, fights inner demons and is almost destroyed by them. Or sometimes, as here, is himself destroyed.The Imitation Game I saw posters for this film, and then I heard about what it was about, having never watched Sherlock before, and only seeing its leading star in War Horse, I was looking forward to seeing the leading actor in a full length film, playing another genius. Based on the true story, set during the darkest days of World War II, Alan Turing (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Benedict Cumberbatch), educated at Cambridge University, is called into the office of Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) in Bletchley Park regarding an important job position, he is a groundbreaking thinker, and he knows that British Intelligence are trying to break the impossible Enigma Code, being used by the Nazis to transmit their secret messages. With the authorised provisions and resources from Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Turing works alongside a motley group of scholars, mathematicians, linguists, chess champions and intelligence officers, but also an advertisement goes in the newspaper to find another genius, those who can solve a crossword puzzle in under ten minutes are invited to a meeting to test their problem solving skills, and following a test they find Joan Clarke (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Keira Knightley). As well as seeing Turing and his team racing against time to break the "unbreakable" Enigma code, with the hand built computer machine working through the millions of possible combinations, the film also sees the other key points in Turing's life, including young teenager Alan (Alex Lawther) educated at boarding school and gaining his interest in problem solving and cryptanalysis (translating and deciphering secret codes and ciphers), and forwarding to the 1950s when Turing is arrested, with Detective Robert Nock (Rory Kinnear) investigating his crime of gross indecency. While the unending problem solving goes on Turing struggles with his own personal identity, he had particular feelings for boys when he was younger, he does love and gets engaged to Joan, but he is in fact homosexual, the only one who knows is Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode), Turing does eventually tell Joan, but she does not want it to ruin whatever is between them. Finally Turing has a breakthrough with the Nazi messages, from some deciphering he and his team see that the Germans always mention "weather" and "Hitler", so they search all messages for these words, and they break the code, but they do not want to make the Germans suspicious or aware of their breakthrough, so they only mildly change the strategies that the British and ally forces have already planned. Following the end of the war, all evidence of the Enigma code work is destroyed, including the records of the people who worked on it, but in the years to come the authorities did discover that Turing was gay, which was at the time illegal, it is not seen in the film, but Turning was convicted for gross indecency, punished with chemical castration, and following this he killed himself with cyanide poisoning, the Queen however posthumously pardoned his crime in 2013/14. Also starring Allen Leech as John Cairncross, Matthew Beard as Peter Hilton, Mark Strong as Stewart Menzies, Tuppence Middleton as Helen, Steven Waddington as Superintendent Smith and Tom Goodman-Hill as Sergeant Staehl. Cumberbatch is outstanding as the charming, amusingly over thinking and credible genius, you really believe him as the brilliant, unfairly treated and now to be remembered war hero, there is also fantastic support from Knightley as his confidante and fianc√©e, Kinnear as the detective who investigates his sexuality, and Dance as his firm superior. I agree with critics that this film could have taken a few more risks, there is not enough about how serious a crime homosexuality was at the time, and the horrendous punishment he received, but the script is very well written, all action included makes for a convincing portrayal of the story, and you are gripped watching the team, the cogs of the machine turn and how important solving the impossible was for the success of winning the war, a fantastic wartime thriller based on a true story. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Director for Morten Tyldum, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Alexandre Desplat and Best Production Design, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Sound and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Screenplay and Best Original Score. Very good!Mostly correct... It's the best movie about Turing yet. Mostly historically correct with the odd exception. Don't try to read Andrew Hodge's book Enigma unless you're a mathematician (it's really boring). Try the Universal machine instead, which puts Turing into his historical context http://go.shr.lc/1pApT9q There's no mention of the Lorenz code that was also broken at Bletchley. This code was used by Nazi High Command and was much more complicated than Enigma. It resulted in Bletchley building the world's first computer (Colossus) to crack it. Tommy Flower a post office engineer designed it with some help from Turing though he wasn't directly responsible for it. Turing did work on Manchester Mark 1 after the war. He also worked on bio-informatics and devised a formula that show how a leopards spots form. Brillian man.Absolutely fantastic! I am not a person who gives away 10/10 and if a movie can get it, it has win my mind which i very difficult indeed! This movie did that very well I must say. I knew very little about enigma but i never knew it was so important and it played such a crucial role in winning the war with Germany. This movie really deserves a round of applause. The characters were brilliant i could literally visualize the scenes. Which i am sure everyone will however watches it. Contents were well organized and it had certain amount of suspense which required to keep the flow and make it interesting at the same time. Everyone knew what would happen at last but it was fun watching it, at least i did, so will you i promise. I won't make this review too long but i just want to say this movie is brilliant and it's surely worth watching. So go on guys and give it a try! Have fun üòäOutstanding This has to be one of the best films of this or any other year. It features a performance from Benedict Cumberbatch that will surely win him an Oscar. He is supported by an outstanding cast and a story line that if it were not true would be hard to believe! As a tribute to Alan Turing this fine film fits the bill. The story will be familiar to most but still manages to have a few twists and turns along the way as Turing's personality clashes with those above and below him. Benedict Cumberbatch presents Turing as someone who is just too intelligent for normal society. His obsession with cracking the code leads to tension within his team and a lack of support from those above him. His sexuality is touched upon at the end of the film and his post-war years viewed from 2014 seem to be from another different world of social acceptability. A must see film!Outstanding This is by far my most anticipated movie ever. And it was well worth the wait.  This film, about the accomplishments, trials and tribulations of gay mathematician and codebreaker Alan Turing, is utterly breathtaking and well crafted.  Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Alan Turing is not just the performance of the year, it's one of the best performances of all time. He breathes life, passion and extreme emotion into this role, more so than any other of his other performances. I had read the biography of Alan Turing, by Andrew Hodges, a year before the film's release. although it is a very loose adaptation of the book, it is an entertaining version of the story. The book was intensely complex and lengthy, and, just as the opening lines of the movie state, you have to pay attention. Personally, I can't think a better film adaptation of the intricate, enigmatic and beautiful story of Alan Turing.  Seeing what all these men and women did during the war, and all of the achievements Alan did, such as making the first designs for a digital computer (sadly this is only alluded to in the film) and shortening the war by two years, is just extraordinary.  The film truly does justice to a man so horribly wronged by a homophobic system at the time. We can only hope that prejudice doesn't recede to its harsher ways so that lives such as these are ruined forever.Wonderful and contemporaneously inspiring "Sometimes it's the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine" ‚Äì The Imitation Game This film is inspiring on many different levels. It is a chapter of WWII of which I was unaware. The German code breakers and their brilliant analysis of what was prudent to strike and what was not was simply amazing. It shows one why fascism political, religious or otherwise cannot be allowed to win the day. In WWII the time in which the film takes place, western civilization and true democracy hung by a thread. The British code breaker mathematical genius Alan Turing saved our proverbial necks from fascism's tyranny! Suggested reading: "It Can Happen Here" by Sinclair Lewis. Alan Turning got a raw deal and his maltreatment was in no small part because of who he was -- gay at a time when not only was it criminal but your body could be medically attacked for it. Thank you Alan Turning for showing us why our treatment of gays had to change and thank you for doing nothing more than saving western civilization! We owe you a huge apology. It CAN happen here and we have the extremists to prove it.I live this movie. The movie is just amazing. every character was portrayed so well the music and outfits were perfect everything just went great together. I don't believe anyone could of played Alan Turing better between being normal and after the case and Alan gets put on drugs Benedict played it wonderfully. Matthew Goode interpretation of Hugh was on point, he acted mean and angry wonderfully and played the nice guy even better. The dialog between Alan and John was played perfect by Benedict and Allen Leech, this really showed when Alan found out John was the spy. Knightley plays Joan great between the facial expressions and the pausing in her dialog.Simply stunning Let this be the first thing, I have not read the book as yet so I can't compare that to the film. The actors in this play their respective parts to perfection. Nothing is over acted in this fantastic story and trip through the eyes of Alan Turin. His autistic behaviour and his charm and awkwardness are played so well by Benedict Cumberbatch. He knows when to be quiet in his role but yet his actions, his presence are what really shine through. I found myself absolutely falling in love with this film. Keira Knightly finally played a role she was perfect for, she wasn't over the top which I usually find her to be. The story which I will not give away to much for some who do not know was of a heartbreaking kind on so many levels but I have to say this film will go down as a top 5 film of all time. The modern Era has Shawshank Redemption and I say this is on Par. Enjoy this movie for it's classic settings which are done to perfection, great acting by all and a fascinating insight into one of history's most defining times during the war. 9.5 out of 10 EnjoyI want to give this movie 159 million million million stars! The Imitation Game is well constructed, moving and absolutely brilliant I was watching this, not really knowing what to expect. Normally I'm not into historical films, but this one caught my attention from the first minute. The actors are terrific, especially Benedict Cumberbatch, he is simply amazing in this.  I sat 1 hour and 50 minutes, totally sucked into another universe, and when I was finished I felt really empty.  This is easily the best movie I've watched this year, and I'm so happy I decided to try it even though it wasn't my usual cup of tea. I highly recommend this movie, not just to Benedict Cumberbatch fans or history lovers, but everyone. Go watch it fellas :)A remarkable movie - but not to be taken as a documentary, nor even as the only way to tell this story This is one remarkable movie. Yes, the story of the breaking of the enigma machine codes is a fascinating one, though, as one reviewer points out, this movie really doesn't get into the details of how that was achieved - details that most of us, myself included, could probably not have understood. And the tale of Turing, the man who led the team that cracked Enigma and thereby helped to save millions of lives by bringing WW II to an earlier end but then was persecuted under England's anti-gay laws, is a truly sad one. Again, though, it appears that the movie fabricates some details to make the tale particularly moving. But neither of those two historical events makes this the remarkable movie that it most certainly is. Rather, it's the same stuff that has made for great movies from the beginning: 1) a brilliant script that never plays down to the audience, but always keeps us interested 2) first-rate directing that knows how to bring such a script to effective life 3) first-rate acting that makes us forget we are watching actors and makes us believe we are watching real people going through real situations. This movie held my interest from the beginning and never let it go. I feel safe in recommending it to anyone who enjoys a really good movie. I see that some of the reviews on here talk about the differences between Turing and the breaking of the Enigma codes as presented in this movie and the historical truth. That's interesting, certainly, because this movie very much makes us want to know more about both, but it has nothing to do with the quality of this feature film. If I may make an extreme comparison, the real Medieval prince of Denmark, son of King Hamlet, bore very little resemblance to Shakespeare's masterful creation, yet we don't fault the play *Hamlet* because of that. This movie, like Shakespeare's play, takes aspects of certain historical events and characters and creates a remarkable and deeply moving story from them. It never pretends to be a documentary, and therefore should not be faulted for not being historically accurate. At the recommendation of one of the other reviewers on here, I have since watched the BBC TV movie *Breaking the Code* (1996) about Turing. Again the script is very good, and the performance by the actor who portrays Turing, Derek Jacobi, first rate. The presentations of Turing are VERY different, however. Jacobi's Turing is far less anti-social, and the BBC movie centers far more on the persecution of Turing for his homosexuality in the 1950s than on the breaking of the codes during the war. The presentation of Turing is far more sympathetic. I confess that I found *The Imitation Game* to be more engaging, however.  Since Milos Forman's *Amadeus* was on TV the other night, I was also reminded of how similar the framing device in *The Imitation Game* is to the one used in that masterpiece. Once again the body of the movie consists of developments of scenes mentioned by the main character to an interrogator (a police man, a confessing priest) through whose reactions to the unfolding story we are given a key as to how to perceive it ourselves. The police interrogator's face, at the end, when he says that he cannot pass judgment on what Turing has told him reminded me of the thoroughly devastated priest who is left speechless after hearing Salieri's presentation of his battle with God.Breathtaking Wow. I don't even know what to say. I already watched this film a while ago and thought it was really good, but now I watched it again and it really is one of the best works I've ever seen. The film captures Turing's life in such an emotional, but still believable way. While watching Turing and his co-workers/friends slowly breaking Enigma, we not only get some flashbacks into Turing's childhood, but also see what happens after the war. Turing was an absolute mastermind with an amazing personality and an ending which he did not deserve. Two things I'd like to mention are the music which is incredibly emotional as well and the ending scene which told us about Turing's machine and suicide. All in all, it's a breathtaking film that I'd definitely recommend to everyone.One of the Best movies of ALL TIME !!! I do not know what to say about this movie. It is surely one of the BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!!!!!! Perfect in terms of script and directing. Benedict Cumberbatch is giving the performance of a life time and his portrayal of Turing is, to the very least, fantastic. This movie will completely change your perception about life, those around you and the devices you are using. The Imitation Game includes interesting messages regarding homosexuality and the fact that it can indeed be wonderful, inspiring and even be the cause to solve all enigmas. In a sense the movie claims that the solution to all enigmas, to war is love irrespective of gender!!! What a wonderful message in an era where gay rights are not yet accepted. A MUST SEE!!! Go watch it NOW!!!A movie to think about... "Sometimes it is the people no one imagines of who do the things no one can imagine." - Christopher Morcom The Imitation Game by Morten Tyldum is a well scripted biopic about the success behind the Second World War with the help of Prof. Alan Turing and his team of the best cryptographers in Britain, portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Allen Leech, Matthew Goode and many more. The movie in general is about a machine developed by Turing to break Germany's Enigma machine. This machine was later developed by scientists to create the Turing Machines which is now known as computers. The Imitation Game is more than the invention of a machine. It's about acceptance. It questions the degree of acceptance that we as a society have in regard to the uniqueness in each one of us. Alan Turing is known as the father of computer science and he was homosexual. As the movie's creators say, 'It took a man with secrets to break the biggest one.' I believe if I say anything further, there is high chance that I might spoil the story for some of you. In all, it was totally worth the wait (around 1 and a half years for me), and Benedict Cumberbatch being a great actor as he always is, has done an excellent job.A MUST See to understand the reason we live free Based upon a true story During WWII math genius Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) leads a team of cryptologists to crack the German codes from the Enigma machine. Cracking of these German codes helped shorten WWII and saved millions of lives.  It is more than a shame that the Academy could not see that there were 2-movies (the other one being the Theory of Everything) that were equally deserving of an Oscar for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director and Best anything else. The Imitation Game is wholly important because of Turing's building a machine that could decode Enigma, and, of course, the importance of Stephen Hawking's brilliance in science theories. What's wrong with having 2-movies share Oscars? Nothing. So there! There are 2-stories in here. One dealing with decoding the Enigma machine and the other having to do with his homosexuality which was a crime. in England. It was just talked about. We see nothing uncomfortable within. Too many critics are complaining that this was not presented in a more open way. The real story here is the impact and decoding of Enigma and the effects on the whole world.  Detective Nock (Rory Kinnear) a local police detective believed there was something wrong with Turing when he investigated a break-in at Turing's house. The detective could not find anything in Turing's background including anything military, and suspected that he was a German spy. In the end Turing was charged with indecent exposure and agreed to Chemical Castration instead of going to jail. We see flashbacks to when Alan Turing was a student at a boy's school and meeting Christopher. Later Turing names his decoding machine Christopher.  The whole production is first rate and Cumberbatch does an excellent job portraying Turning. The whole cast performed well enough to have this movie win Oscars (note plural). Notables included Mark Strong, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, and Charles Dance. Still the most important thing about this is the ENIGMA STORY itself. What happened during that time whether it concerned the Polish who were the first to decode Enigma or Turing's participation this must be HIT HOME: We live the way we do because of what happened during that time by all those involved. End of story. A great line by Joan Clark (Knightley) to Turning: "the world is an infinitely better place because of what you did." So true.  Since every time we get a "True Story" we really never know the whole truth about certain aspects. That is why those still interested in Alan Turing and Enigma should go to Wikipedia to learn more. And maybe those who do that will get a better appreciation of Alan Turing and of those who helped decode the Enigma machine.  Alan Turing committed suicide in 1954 and it is believed he bit into an apple laced with cyanide. Some say that Steve Jobs used the apple (with that bite) logo in honor of Alan Turing who became instrumental in the development of computers. (10/10) Violence: Not really. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No. Rating: AUK Actors Rule in Film and TV, The Imitation Game is no Exception The Imitation Game was a very good movie. I like UK films and UK actors. They hone their craft well. For drama nothing beats their abilities. Perhaps it comes from their extensive education, theater and TV background before moving on to film. However, when I think of the great movies and TV shows coming out of Hollywood today most of the actors seem to be of UK origin. I'm thinking David Oyelowo in Selma, Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything, Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage in the Hobbit, Rosamund Pike in Gone Girl, Rachel Weisz in Interstellar, Sam Heughan, Caitriona Balfe, Tobias Menzies and Graham McTavish from Outlander just to list a few this season that blew me away.  In The Imitation Game, we get several great UK actors as well: Benedict Cumberbatch does a fabulous job as Alan Turing. He plays the introverted yet flawed genius of Alan Turning to perfection. I feel not enough credit is going to Keira Knightley who played Joan Clarke the only woman on the team, her character was a genius in her own right who would not have been taken seriously except for Turning. Keira has the ability to transform herself into whatever role she's asked to take on, and this one is no exception. She is what makes Turing's character understandable and likable. If not for his relationship with her, Benedict would not have a vehicle to show his vulnerable side in this movie, and it is that side which we come to relate to the terrible tragedy of his life. Other actors of note in The Imitation game were, Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander, Matthew plays the charming, handsome, likable man on the team who balances the performance by Cumberbatch and I thought Alex Lawther as the young Alan Turing turned in a great performance and gave you an understanding as to why Turning became like he was. The movie plot was well done, interesting story line. As a mathematician and computer scientist I knew of Turning's contribution to the field of computational mathematics and computer science. I, like many, probably knew little about his life, his involvement in the WWII, nor his homosexuality and what the government of the day did to him because of it. It was indeed an enlighten story from many aspects. We see how people of difference not only make amazing contributions to our society if allowed to, but also how governments make life and death choices every day some for the good of mankind, some bad because of the prejudices of the times. I think this story has many lessons for all of us. I strongly recommend this film. It's a must see for all this season.An Imitation of a good movie The Imitation Game had a buzz around it like few other movies. With the culture in Hollywood it is understandable. The acting is first class by all the actors but the movie itself is very good at best, for one simple reason, it is not that entertaining. Halfway into the movie you will realize what the Hollywood buzz was all about. Fitting the Hollywood agenda perfectly, the movie got rave reviews, but the fact is on it's own , the plot is slow, plodding and it turns very preachy at the end. If the heroine was just a plain, old, normal, guy, not only would this movie have gotten no notoriety, it would not have even been made. The film is listed as a "thriller". That is one of the biggest misnomers in history. It is slow and boring. The ending is so preachy, I honestly expected a national anthem of sorts to be played at the film's end. That an agenda filled anthem has not been created is a mystery. Joan Baez, Helen Reddy or The Cure I am sure would have a song worthy of this movie's ending. Almost half of the people who watch this film will like it. Even the ones who like it though will not watch and re-watch this film, it is not an enjoyable movie like Gone With the Wind or Casablanca, or My Cousin Vinny, where you want to see the film over and over. The other half of the people who watch this movie will wonder , what office do I apply to in order to, "get these two hours of my life back".
An incredibly powerful film! http://switchingreels.com/2014/01/28/sundance-review-whiplash/ Ever had a dream of being a great football player? A great dancer? A great singer? A great musician? Our protagonist has a dream of being a great drummer, a drummer that will be remembered forever. Maybe you are still fighting for your dream. Maybe you have given up on greatness. Greatness doesn't come easily, you need to practice at it. Andrew practices until his hands bleed. Andrew (Miles Teller) is 19-year old student at a music conservatory in Manhattan. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity. I had a billiards teacher at one point in my life, who was close to becoming a pro in his craft but a grease fire accident changed all that. His perspective changed, to paraphrase, he realized he was becoming an asshole. He became a teacher of pool instead of becoming a pro player. Through him, I can understand what Terrence Fletcher was trying to instill into Andrew. My teacher would push me a little bit. When he gave me opportunities to show him up, "run the table now," he would tell me, I failed. It's embarrassing when that happens but it's also a learning tool because more work needs to be done. You can't get by on talent alone but it certainly helps. On the other side of it, I saw a little bit of my teacher in Andrew. Losing who you are to perfect something you love. Good thing my teacher realized before it was too late. I lost myself in the story. It had something to say about not settling and asking more of yourself. Two fantastic performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Perhaps it will push you to maybe pick up that guitar again, put on your ballet shoes, or hit the gym to bulk up. Whiplash is an incredibly powerful film. And after the final shot cuts to black, the film will stick with you for days. My expectations: Medium. I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me. Expectations exceeded. Recommendation: Cinema lovers and casual movie goers, I believe will enjoy this film. Re-watch value: I can watch this film again and I actually can't wait until it hits distribution. Memorable: I am still thinking about this film.An important hardened lesson in resilience and when to stop measuring up to your mentor. Whiplash is a captivating study of ambition. Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January, Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowd-pleasing intensity. On the surface, it's a gritty story about a brutal student-mentor relationship that oversteps boundaries. Underneath, it's a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition. Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing. As a result, it's the best film I've seen in years, and I say that without hesitation. This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts. If writer/director Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist, then he has achieved it.  Miles Teller, who's been steadily growing on me since The Spectacular Now, stars as Andrew Neyman, a 19-year-old aspiring jazz drummer who's pushed and inspired by the abuse and aspirations of his school band leader Fletcher, played by the ferocious J.K. Simmons like we've never seen him before. Chazelle has described the film as an origin story to the jazz musicians of the golden age, and it thrives on the myths of jazz heroes such as Charlie Parker. They're urgently looking for the next Parker, in search of perfection. But with that comes a great irony. The music genre is known as one for freedom of expression but here the jazz is soulless and mechanical, and that clouds the ethical judgment of the characters. Even so, Fletcher is a man who can tell if you have the right tempo within a bar. Although most of the audience for the film may not know much about music including myself, you get a feel for what he's looking for and when someone's wrong even if you don't know why. Simmons is as good as they say he is. He's a force of nature, with a terrifying presence that incites the fear Bryan Cranston achieved with the peak of his Walter White. But it's not a one-note performance. Simmons is still subversive with moments of weakness, insecurity, approachability, and he also sometimes brings in the lightness he's known for in other roles with Jason Reitman, exec producer here.  Even though he's an unlikeable character with nothing nice to say, he's still somewhat endearing and enigmatic, much like R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket. This demasculinisation through a barrage of insults is a theme explored in Whiplash and it argues whether it's a crime or an 'ends justifying the means' factor of life. It's not just a music film, but also one that adapts to the elements of sports training, war at boot camp and biopic genres with the way it frames its elements. Fletcher is representative of the devil on our shoulders that yells at us that we're not good enough and that symbolic idea resonates deeply for me. His poisonous words are more a part of Andrew's psyche than legitimate coaching techniques. What grabs me about the film is its discussion on artistic perfection, and especially in these intimate and rough sequences of practicing. What is objectively great in art? When is it good enough, and why? It toes a fascinating line. That's why drumming is such an interesting choice for the film to explore because it's so instinctive. Drummers have to make decisions within a fraction of a second and talent can only take you so far. The roaring beat in Whiplash puts your heart in your throat. Teller's performance as Andrew is terrific, one to match Simmons.  Chazelle is committed on expressing the physicality of drumming and Teller captures it exhaustively without feeling contrived. It's the virtuosity of the writing that allows us into Andrew's head however. It's a long road to the top, but the script makes the right decision to allow him to revel in the little moments of success, but then to immediately test him in surprising and involving ways. Each turn of the story shapes his expectations and ambitions and then escalates it to the right point. While the film is a gripping experience nonetheless, in retrospect perhaps it is too bitingly cynical. It does suggest that you have to be deprived of a meaningful relationship to achieve your goals. It does appear to be very anti-positive reinforcement, but perhaps it's merely a statement on the abundant sheltering that the latest generation is enduring. Whiplash is refreshing to see, we all know we wouldn't be resilient enough to take that kind of punishment so it's cathartic to watch Andrew go through it all and see how far he'll go. His frustration, regrets, fear and rage with himself cuts to the core of the human condition as he's pushed further and further.  The technical aspects of the film help it become so stimulating with dizzying closeups tightly edited together and its the stark orange tinted cinematography. It's thoroughly impressive that the film was shot in only 19 days for them to get shots so immaculately timed and performed with all those complicated movements. There's a refreshing brevity to the film with its sharp atmosphere, but it's so rich in emotion, psychological tension and personal subtext. It neither rushes nor drags, on paper nor on screen. It really is a film that lingers in your mind for days, nagging you, like Fletcher over your shoulder. Maybe it'll continue to linger for weeks. I hope so too, especially for Oscar voters. It seems that J.K. Simmons is building momentum to be a lock for Best Supporting Actor at this point. However, Whiplash isn't just a best of year film, nor best of decade. It approaches best of all-time worthy with its identifiable themes of meticulous work ethics, fulfilling aspirations, resilience of the soul, and knowing when to no longer measure yourself to your mentor. I'll take this film with me for a while as a screaming motivator. 10/10. Best film of the decade. Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)A masterful tale of inspiration, set against a world of obsession, dedication and confrontation An unknown title, by an unknown director, starring an unknown lead, what does that form? Only one of the best damn dramas of this century to date. Inspiring, intense, reverent, Damien Chazelle's jazz-infused drama is an incredibly complex character study that has newcomer Miles Teller and veteran J.K. Simmons at the top of their game in this brilliant effort, 'Whiplash' is arguably the most riveting and sensational drama from 2014. J.K. Simmons stars as antihero Terence Fletcher, a character we look at as the opportunity of Andrew's success, but also we hate for his brutal portrayal. From his profanity-clad embodiment of evil to the ever-hopeful light at the end of the film, we go through stages of loving, hating and even fearing him, a character who despite his occasional moments of sympathy, cares solely about the outcome of his orchestra, and shuns away anyone who tries to destroy that. Simmons's performance is flawless and breathless, a truly resonant achievement, and one of the most Oscar-deserving performances of recent years. The gold and black colour palette, fast-paced editing, fluent and claustrophobic cinematography - every single component adds a fresh face to 21st century cinema and independent films as a whole, further supporting my conclusion that indie films have overtaken blockbusters for the provision of unique visions and entertainment. Chazelle's effort pays off as he creates not only one of the greatest villains of the 21st century in the form of Fletcher, but also one of the greatest movies of the 21st century, if not of all time, through which he rekindled the dying flame that is jazz. The fusion of emotions throughout make this a film that thrusts the audience into a world of obsession, dedication and confrontation, thus ensuing a tale of inspiration, a man and his dreams of becoming a "somebody", and to conclude, let's just note that final drum solo and sense of rebellion Andrew feels, it is utter gold, truly perfect. This movie is powerful, it is intense, it is unique, it is a stunning masterpiece!Tension, tension, tension! After seeing Damien Chazelle's Whiplash - a film the young up-and- coming director wished to do for some time now - being so beautifully realized and brought to life by everyone involved in the project, I was glad and relieved, mainly because I have seen the short film, which was pretty incredible. I believe that among the most telling facts about a film's fortunes and qualities, is the ability to broaden it's public, but in the same time not forgetting that cinema is not all about commercial success and mass audiences.Or with other words - a film that is not just eye candy and booms and explosions, but also craft, soul, dedication and wits. Those are some of the things not only the film itself possesses, but the people behind it have in abundance as well. The upcoming Miles Teller plays the young and dedicated student Andrew Nieman, who has the drive, the ambition to succeed and to be great, which is fine, as long as it doesn't derail your personal life.A lesson the young drummer learns the hard way. Blind ambition is the thing, that can describe our anti-hero of sorts, Terrence Fletcher a.k.a the brilliant J.K. Simmons, who has a thing for mindeffin' his students to the point of total physical and mental exhaustion and even depression.But he does it for a reason, for the sole purpose of finding the next big, even great, thing in jazz and in music as a whole.The next prodigy, the next "Yardbird" Charlie Parker that will be otherwise lost, if not being pushed to the very limit. And boy, does J.K. Simmons nails it.Chazelle has done a masterful job in casting the two leads in Teller and Simmons.Their respective acts are full of purpose, full of tension and ultimately terrific. Expect some awards going in the way of "Whiplash" and look out for Simmons in the Oscars shortlist, that's how good he is in it.And in his own words: "What a shame we wrapped it up in only 19 days".It must have been really fun playing a part like Terrence Fletcher and Simmons completely sold it. As I said, the best movies are those, that reach out to the most diverse and wide spectrum of audiences, not those, who can connect to a massive number of people, who are representatives of only one specific audience type.And Chazelle has achieved just that with "Whiplash" - a precise, tension-building film, full of beautifully staged pieces and above all else, a love towards music and the challenges it often represents if you want to get to the very top. The film ended in a big round of applause from the packed theater and I am sure that will be the case a long time from now! My grade: 9/10Wow just wow. Easily one of the greatest films of the year There is so many excellent great things to say about this film. To start off I will say it may be slow and to different for some to enjoy and so that I warn you. Now I will say that I can not express the idea enough of how surprising this film is. Jk Simmons does an outstanding performance as the highly unpredictable hair trigger tempered teacher Fletcher, Miles Teller an actor who I've only seen in mediocre comedies also shines in a breakthrough performance as the ambitious drummer Andrew. The performance are outstanding and that's just the tip of the iceberg. My favorite thing about this film is how it has created it's own one of a kind spot in the music genre of film, it's atmosphere is unlike any other as well. The idea that this film is one of a kind can't be stressed enough, I guarantee you cannot find another film out there like this. This film expresses a shockingly high intensity for a music film. I believe that Jk Simmons acting is what fueled a lot of the intensity. When you watch this film even though it's pace will seem slow to most it's intensity is impossible to miss.  I can see how a lot of certain people may find this film hard to enjoy but for me this film as slow as it is couldn't have been more intense. The mere fact that a music film shows some strong intensity like this one did is mind blowing to me. I don't know how many of you had this same experience or something similar then you already know what I'm talking about. I have a good feeling and I'm hopeful this film rakes in some acting Oscars because this film deserves at least one. I haven't read anything on this films page and I'm sure others have expressed similar opinions and all I can say is listen and trust me. I'm praying you enjoy this film and experience it's one of a kind intensity just as I did. Thanks for reading my review and enjoy.Intense This movie was far better than the trailer made it look. JK Simmons gave a stellar performance as a music teacher in the best Jazz school, trying desperately to find and develop the next jazz legend. From the moment he appears he demands the screen, literately. There's a part in the flick were he just burst open the door putting a halt on whatever is going, and makes it all about what he wants, which sets the tone for the entire movie. One of the best antagonist I've seen at the movies. Miles Teller plays the protagonist, A first year Jazz student who wants to be the next Jazz legend and is willing to go through the pain needed to become just that. I've been a fan of Miles Teller for a while and this movie just increase my fandom It does not matter whether you are into jazz or not, this flick is about and boy willing to kill himself to become the best and the man willing to kill the boy so he can be the best. For anyone who has ever been in that kind of pressure, weather it be at college or on the playing field(I kid you not, watching these guys play Jazz played out like I was watching a Football movie with Miles being the Quarterback and JK being the coach)  It was an emotion trill ride with a lot of ups and downs, and just when you think the ride is over, we go for a second time around.  Excellence!!Sure to be one of the best films of the year Whiplash is low budget film making at its finest, and surely promises big things from rookie director/writer Damien Chazelle. Seeing this film in theaters was the first time this year that I have completely enraptured (granted, I have not seen all of the top films that have come out so far). Also, I am a succor for quality films about musicians, and Whiplash ranks in my all time favorites in that genre. The tension did not let up from the very first scene, especially as soon as the incredible J.K. Simmons enters. Simmons, along with Miles Teller (who's Project X days are now long behind him) have some of the best on screen chemistry I've seen. They're connected; one cannot act without it affecting the other. The film is almost entirely focused on this relationship, and the simplicity definitely services the film. I hope people will go and see it and vote with their pocketbooks for excellent low budget films.Just My Tempo Greetings again from the darkness. The pursuit of greatness is not always pretty. No matter if your dream is athletics, dancing, music or some other; you can be sure hard work and sacrifice will be part of your routine. You will likely have a mentor, teacher or coach whose job is to cultivate your skills while pushing you to new limits. This film questions whether the best approach is intimidation or society's current preferred method of nurturing. Miles Teller plays Andrew, a first year student at an elite Manhattan music conservatory. Andrew dreams of being a great jazz drummer in the vein of Buddy Rich. When offered a rare shot at the top ensemble, Andrew quickly discovers the conductor is a breed unlike anything he has ever encountered. The best movie comparison I can offer for JK Simmons' portrayal of Terence Fletcher is R Lee Ermey's Drill Instructor in Full Metal Jacket. This is no Mr Holland's Opus. Fletcher bullies, intimidates, humiliates and uses every imaginable form of verbal abuse to push his musicians, and especially young Andrew, to reach for greater heights. Andrew and Fletcher go head to head through the entire movie, with Fletcher's mental torment turning this into a psychological thriller ... albeit with tremendous music. We witness Andrew shut out all pieces of a personal life, and even take on some of Fletcher's less desirable traits. Andrew's diner break-up with his girlfriend (Melissa Benoist) is much shorter, but just as cold as the infamous opening scene in The Social Network. At a small dinner party, Andrew loses some of the sweetness he inherited from his dad (Paul Reiser), and unloads some Fletcherisms on some unsuspecting family friends. Writer/Director Damien Chazelle has turned his Sundance award-winning short film into a fascinatingly brutal message movie that begs for discussion and debate. The open-ended approach is brilliant, though I found myself initially upset at the missing clean wrap that Hollywood so often provides. What price greatness? Is comeuppance a reward? Are mentors cruel to be kind? For the past few years, I have been proclaiming that Miles Teller (The Spectacular Now) is the next John Cusack. Perhaps that bar is too low. Teller just gets better with each film. His relentless energy draws us in, and we find ourselves in his corner ... even though this time, he's not the greatest guy himself. Still, as strong as Teller is, the film is owned by JK Simmons. Most think of him as the dad in Juno, or the ever-present insurance spokesman on TV, but he previously flashed his bad side as the white supremacist in "Oz". Even that, doesn't prepare us for Simmons' powerhouse performance ... just enough humanity to heighten his psychological torturing of musicians. You should see this one for Simmons' performance. Or see it for the up and coming Teller. Enjoy the terrific music, especially Duke Ellington's "Caravan". See it for the talking points about teachers, society and personal greatness. See it for any or all these reasons - just don't tell director Damien Chazelle "good job".They could have done better I saw this about 24 hours ago at the Best of Fest for Sundance, and this last 24 hours I have done little but think about and marvel at this film. I really had zero expectations going in, I heard the buzz surrounding it in town, but knew very little about it as the film began. I have yet to get the words that do my thoughts justice for this movie but I am going to try.  First everything about this film was stellar; casting, writing, acting, directing, music and cinematography all came together to just tell an incredible story. I want to say a bit more about a couple of these aspects.  Acting, first of all I don't know who impressed me more Miles Teller in the lead as Andrew Nieman or JK Simmons playing Band teacher Terence Fletcher. Both did so great that had either been a lesser actor they would have been out shined by the other. Simmons' performance really reminded me of Gunnery Sargent Hartman from Full Metal Jacket, except rather than emotionally destroying and rebuilding marines he was doing it to 18 year old kids. His character could have easily been cartoony and 2 dimensional but Simmons gave him such depth that the whole film I felt compassion for and even understood his motives, even before he lays them out for Nieman in the third act. Two scenes bring you to the core of this character and the line that has intrigued me for 24 hours is "No words in the English language are more dangerous than 'good job.'" (thus why I titled my review as such, sorry I couldn't resist). Then on to Teller's performance, for a younger actor who I haven't seen in much I must say he played his role like a seasoned actor. His performance just wrapped me up and to find out he did much of the drumming himself is insane. Whilst watching some of the intense scenes I felt like I was watching him be executed, and other times it feels like the fight in Rocky, you feel like you are just watching him get demolished, except all of this is emotional rather than the easier physical. Whether it is the discouragement, the socially awkwardness, the single parent household, the internal conflict, the hubris, the arrogance, and at times the mental torture that he put himself through, all just blew me away. Teller reminded me of a much much more talented John Cusack and had the charisma and electricity to connect to the audience.  The one other thing I must commend is the writing, so often you kind of know where a movie is headed but this movie stayed very unpredictable and just when you think for certain how a scene or sequence of scenes will play out they take a hard left and keeps you off balance (in a good way). It was so refreshing, a few times I thought the bow was on the film but then something disrupts how "it should go or end".  Sorry if I rambled, perhaps after thinking on it more I can get a more focused review, needless to say this film is a must-see when it gets a broad release. Great job to all involved and congrats on winning the award at Sundance, you certainly earned it.  One last thing if this gets attention in wide release this could see a heightened interest in Jazz, this is certainly a film that can make even the not-so musically inclined want to throw on a Jazz record and just drown in it.Hollywood hogwash with good technique My non-musician friends love this film and insisted I see it. I've been a jazz musician for over 30 years and have taught in a jazz university for over 20. So they figured I would relate. Sorry, this is total crap and it makes me sad to think that the average guy out there thinks Kenny G is cool and this film is a hard-edged depiction of the high-pressure jazz school scene. First of all, no prof would be there a day after any of the rehearsals Terence ran, he'd be dismissed immediately (not hard to do, apparently this school didn't have tenure). And next, jazz is communication, conversation, thoughtfulness, and a big dollop of joyful soul. Any drummer with the competitive mean-spirited attitude shown by any of these students would find themselves in extremely lonely company, nobody appreciates that. This is the 21st Century equivalent of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland saying, "I know, let's build a show to save the town!" as a representation of Show Biz. it's Hollywood hokum, folks, and I resented its basic assumptions. Where is the Soul? That said, J.K. Simmons is great, working with what he's got. And the cinematography and editing are well done (what IS all that water on the cymbals we see so often? Sweat? If Elvin Jones had gained two hundred pounds he wouldn't have sweated like that! Oh well.) which is why I grudgingly added two stars to this. It's been a while since I so disliked a film. P.S. my drummer plays better than any of these guys. Hah!watching teenagers being abused This movie tries so hard to display the hardships of training to be a musician that the whole image shifts into simple physical and mental abuse of human beings, in this case teenagers. As another reviewer said: it is the boot camp of music. I did not believe what I was seeing. If there was a movie where some dog-whisperer is hitting the dog and yelling at it and this would prove to be working as a method to 'educate' the dog, then people would be upset. But treating a human like that is OK? this just sickens me. yes, you can get humans to do some things by pushing them with violence. Get them into an obedient state of mind, that is simply following orders. But there is a reason why this strategy of motivation has proved to be only effective in the military: There, human lives are indeed worthless. This treatment will make you 'harder', meaning it will make you less of a human being. When it comes to music however it is impossible to achieve great results with these methods. It can only lead to a soul- and heartless disaster. A fitting result would have been an aggression build-up in the main character which would have prevented him from ever playing anything worth listening to again. This reaction has been seen in other movies where usually the people that are socially connected to the main character will have to suffer from the violent state of mind that this mistreatment is causing. The other possibility is a simple resignation, either by quitting music or by quitting life. But what is displayed here is wrong on many levels, because it tells you that this abuse leads to something beautiful. That it is all worth it because it pushes you to your limits and then you will be a great musician. Whoever made up this story is either suffering from a severe psychosis or has the intent to justify abusive methods in education by presenting them as effective. If you treat people with violence they will get violent too. Either towards others or towards themselves. This is the only result you will achieve. And in this case it would also completely destroy the main character's ability to be a musician. Music is not the military. You do need discipline and training, but this comes from mental strength. And you do not get stronger by being abused. It will only weaken you. It makes me sad seeing that apparently this movie is entertaining to people. This can only be the case if they do not see the utter failure in judgment that is presented here. And if they do not see it then they are blind in a way that is worrying.A pair of outstanding performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons embody Damien Chazelle's piece of perfection... When it comes to cinema, there are often little gems in a sea of bigger spectacles, that can break through in the most proficient way. Last year, I pleaded to the entire film universe that discover and understand "Inside Llewyn Davis" from the Coen Brothers after seeing it for the first time at NYFF. This year, I've seem to already come to terms that the next film that will utilize all my energy and resources this year will be Damien Chazelle's highly intense psychological drama "Whiplash." An impeccable and tightly wound experience that brings your anxiety to a feverish level. As small, and utterly different as I'm about to compare, I haven't felt this uneasy with a film's tension since Paul Greengrass' "Captain Phillips," coincidentally also was a NYFF title. Two other similar traits that embody the two are the intense and completely submersible performances that inhabit them. Stars Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are absolutely astonishing, featuring two of the year's very best turns. Chazelle's film tells the story of Andrew (Teller), a first year music student that seeks out and joins the prestigious school band, headed by an intense and frightening teacher Mr. Fletcher (Simmons). Walking out of the screening I fully knew (though I fully hope to be proved wrong this year) that Miles Teller would be my "Oscar Isaac" this year. A performance that should shoot to the top of any awards consideration for a lead actor, but unfortunately will be passed over show after show. Teller is submerged in a way that we haven't seen the young actor achieve at this stage in his career. After plowing onto the scene opposite Nicole Kidman in "Rabbit Hole," and then helming "The Spectacular Now" with complete ease and intensity, I was not expecting him to be the machine of fury and magnitude that is on display in "Whiplash." There are moments where he channels the emotional aura of performances like Tom Hulce/F. Murray Abraham in "Amadeus," as crazy as that sounds. I am so excited to see where Teller goes from here. It makes the future of film a lot more bright, knowing that someone like him will be rising up in the ranks. Everything you've heard about J.K. Simmons is true and then some. A fully fleshed out supporting role, Chazelle doesn't write Fletcher as a caricature. He's a deeply acute individual, full of passion and acrimony. Chazelle doesn't keep Simmons at a "10," he and Simmons allow him to find a range of empathy, hatred, and cryptic allowances that will keep you at the edge of your seat. As I watched Simmons flesh out a performance that can only be described as magnificent, I kept coming back in my mind to Christoph Waltz in the Oscar-winning "Inglourious Basterds," a role that found much heat on the awards circuit. The world/all film lovers will not be able ignore the stunning presence of Simmons. A Supporting Actor nominations (maybe even a win) seems all but assured (and deserved). Looking back at the veteran actor's career that included memorable roles in "Juno," "Burn After Reading," and "Up in the Air," a role like this could not have come at a better time. Already impressive in his brief work in Jason Reitman's "Men, Women &amp; Children," writers, directors, casting agents, and producers will be pounding on the actor's door. You can't credit "Whiplash" without citing the words and control by writer/director Damien Chazelle. An amazing and outstanding sophomore effort (unfortunately have not seen his debut "Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench") that channels a young Bennett Miller. Vigorous, self-assured, and innovative, Chazelle is a brilliant auteur filmmaker that knows exactly what type of films he wants to make. He takes inspiration from his own life, his love of film and music, and other places I'm sure we don't know about, and molds them into a gritty, layered experience, conditioned with rich characters, all realized through the writer's story. It's one of the best scripts of the year. "Whiplash" features some of the best minutes of film seen in 2014. An ending that will bring tears to your eyes, dual performances that will have you applaud, and an experience that you surely will not forget. Drumming has never felt like such a personality. It acts as a visible tool for the viewer to understand and try. If you love music, appreciate education, and dare to be better than your current state, you will find something very real to latch onto. Hold on, and hold on tight. "Whiplash" is being distributed by Sony Pictures Classics and will be released October 10 in limited release (and then expanding after). A must-see for all movie lovers!A dynamic movie full of tensions and twists "Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art."  Charlie Parker sums it all, Cinema is true Art. I wasn't expecting to feel this way after watching this movie. Every moment has tension and something unexpected occurring. It is as if the director had chosen to apply the tempo of the drums to the script. Anyone can relate to this story. We all have pursued a dream, a passion ... Rather or not we made it our everyday job or maybe just a hobby aside, some of us strive for something bigger.  This film is a journey in the search of your inner spirit, inner creativity ... not only will it make it clear that you cannot succeed without effort and hard work, it will also make you realize there are two different kinds of artists : - those who make art, - and those who make beautiful art "Beautiful" because they are stimulated by a special strength within, a GIFT.  Is it because I reminisce N.Y.C. or that I play the drums? I simply believe the performances were astonishing and the actors perfectly chosen to embody these terrific characters. I won't say "good job" but rather "thank you", to the promising Franco-American director Damien ChazelleÔªø for sharing his vision.Full Metal Fame Jacket...Or something. I gave it 28 minutes. That was generous, in that I knew it was going to be terrible within about 2. I've been to music school. It's not like this. The teachers aren't like this. No one's like this (obviously I'm referring to 'Hollywood idea of what a hard-ass music teacher might be like in some weird juvenile negative fantasy' Fletcher). I switched off when he threw a chair at Andrew the drum prodigy and then slapped him. SLAPPED him. Repeatedly. In front of a whole, cowed class of what, in legal terms, would be called witnesses to an assault, for playing slightly fast, the first time he's ever played to him in a band practice. I'm sorry, what?! Where does this/would this/has this ever happened? In a Charles Dickens novel about a jazz drum student, possibly. In anything even vaguely purporting to be based on real life now, um...No. I'm stunned. Yet another IMDb/Metacritic/Rotten Tomatoes gush-fest that is so laughably bad, you have to check the page again to really believe it's got such high praise. Excruciating nonsense.Moronic, pointless, and full of crap If you are a believer in the clich√©d notion that success can only come from obsessive dedication to the exclusion of all normal human interaction, coupled with mountains of degradation, suffering, humiliation, and physical torture, you will absolutely adore this worthless pile of clich√©s, stereotypes, and bankrupt cinematic ideas. The story of a young jazz drummer who is brutalized by a sadistic teacher in the interests of spurring him to greatness is one of the most repulsive exercises in sheer idiocy ever committed to the screen. I watched and watched, waiting for some valid point to emerge from scenes of torment, bleeding hands, broken relationships, hideous nastiness and all the rest, but in the end, all we get is a whopping nonsensical clich√© that only a fool could buy into. J.K. Simmons (the psychologist from Law and Order) does a credible job as the sadistic teacher, but honestly, no one could do much with a part this stereotypical... he couldn't have been more villainous unless he had a mustache to twirl. And the rest of the cast doesn't do any better with their phony baloney parts. Folks, if you don't have a credible story based in some form of recognizable and believable reality, nothing else matters. The fact that this one gets such a high rating on IMDb proves that HL Mencken was right: No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.Only neat music and cinematography make this tawdry, melodramatic tale of sadomasochistic relationship between jazz conservatory student and teacher, worth watching In the 70s, a new genre of films aimed at black audiences emerged entitled, 'Blaxploitation'. The genre primarily glorified stereotypical "criminal" behavior in black neighborhoods. Now with Damien Chazelle's, 'Whiplash', he's invented a new genre primarily for a large coterie of Caucasian males: 'Jazzploitation', set in an elite jazz program at a Julliard-like school of higher musical instruction. Both white liberal film critics and martial arts enthusiasts alike, will enjoy this exercise in sado-masochistic shenanigans as evidenced by the plethora of rave reviews now gracing a multitude of web pages over the internet. Don't ask any of our critics who rave about the film to require Mr. Chazelle to provide even a modicum of verisimilitude. I'm talking, of course, about how Mr. Chazelle's antagonist, the martinet music instructor, Terence Fletcher, would even last five minutes at a prestigious music conservatory, given his vast repertoire of sociopathic behavior. Oh but wait‚Äî'Whiplash' really is supposed to be more like a fable, so Mr. Chazelle is given a pass‚Äîhe no longer has to be beholden to 'conventional' narratives. But even fables should operate within a somewhat realistic world. And is it realistic to have Fletcher's co-worker shrink from him (are they all so afraid that they dare not assert themselves one bit?) Is it realistic not to see Fletcher's interactions with his supervisors (are they also completely browbeaten by him?) Would the administration allow such a person to continually humiliate his students, hurl ethnic and gay slurs, and actually throw things at the students, which could result in personal injury (possibly subjecting the school to a lawsuit?). Fletcher is clearly a caricature, who belongs in an army setting and not a music conservatory. Nonetheless, Chazelle needs the character to not only titillate us along the way but to illustrate his simplistic morality play, which entails a warning about the dangers of obsessive careerism. Now of course various naysayers will argue that there ARE people like Fletcher who seek to bring out the best in their students by utilizing 'tough love' but such pedagogues in real life must work within the 'system' and the 'pushing' is much more subtle than what is depicted here. The same goes for Chazelle's protagonist, Andrew Neyman, who plays the obsessed drummer student who seeks to get in the good graces of the ruthless Fletcher. Neyman is played by Miles Teller whom I liked very much in 'The Spectacular Now'. Since he plays drums in real life, Teller is pretty convincing playing the drums in the film.  But Chazelle applies the same 'sledge hammer' approach toward the character 'Neyman' as he does with 'Fletcher'. Neyman wants to 'make it' at 'any cost'. He plays the drums so hard until his hands start bleeding (various drummers posting on the internet deny they've seen cases of this); and then on his way to a competition, Neyman gets in a bad car accident, but STILL drags himself to the performance and attempts to play (Chazelle seeks to prove the inane point that Neyman is so obsessed, that he'll do anything to win‚Äîeven if it means playing seriously injured and jeopardizing his own life). No really, can you see anyone doing this? But again, since this is more like a melodramatic fable, Chazelle can have his characters do the most ridiculous things, and seemingly get away with it! Two thirds of the Whiplash plot concerns Fletcher's quest to supposedly bring out the best in his students (none of whom do we really get to know except Neyman). John Bleasdale writing in CineVue finds Fletcher's diatribes appealing: "His razor wit, sheer outrageousness, inventive taunting and vulgar insults are at once appalling and blackly funny." I agree that Fletcher's insults are appalling but "blackly funny"? Keep in mind that all the other characters who come in contact with Fletcher, have no ego, to the point that no one will oppose him. Therefore, Fletcher can get away with saying anything he feels like (some may call this 'wit', but in reality they're simply one note monologues--a set of variations on a theme). The second act crisis manifests itself when Neyman is kicked out of school after physically attacking Fletcher. The way back toward some kind of 'equilibrium' is when Neyman agrees to give a deposition in a lawsuit that eventually leads to Fletcher's dismissal from the conservatory. The Whiplash climax occurs after Neyman and Fletcher meet at a jazz club where Fletcher is now playing and Neyman agrees to play at a showcase. This turns out to be an ambush, since Fletcher arranges for Neyman to get up there without sheet music and he can only end up improvising (Fletcher is so demented that he's seemingly willing to sabotage the entire performance to get back at Neyman who he knows testified against him). Neyman runs off backstage into the arms of his good guy father but suddenly summons the courage to come back and play, where he dazzles, performing an extraordinary drum solo. Has Neyman triumphed after enduring the humiliating set-up? Not at all! He merely plays into Fletcher's stratagem to push him beyond his limits emotionally‚Äîeven if it means that he must sacrifice his dignity and self-worth by allowing the mad sociopath to manipulate him over and over again. In order to accept Chazelle's tawdry tale, one must accept the conventions of melodrama. Clearly it's written as heightened reality to make a point about the sadomasochistic relationship between student and teacher. While Chazelle may ultimately view his characters at a distance with the correct moral upper hand, he mirrors Tarantino, by reveling in the violence that he is also attempting to disdain. The 'Whiplash' machinations end up more tawdry and sensationalistic than compellingly tragic. I would recommend 'Whiplash' for the excellent cinematography and of course all the neat jazz music. I'll pass on the story‚Äîdue to its clear, unrealistic and melodramatic aftertaste.Disgusting nonsense... I find it very sad that so many people - including so-called professional reviewers - have rated this crap so highly. I did not walk out (although I was greatly tempted to do so) but saw it to the end. A total waste of time. Here's what might spoil it for you, should you believe the BS that's being spread around this stinking pile of excrement: It could have actually been OK if it hadn't been so laughably impossibly ridiculous. Perhaps if it had been set in the fifties or the forties when people had much less developed consciousness of human rights? But even so...  I suppose the moral/lesson we are supposed to learn is... if you can't warp your students enough by abuse to force them to become great musicians then it is perfectly alright to discard or destroy them in the attempt.  This glorified tyrant and bully can himself only produce music at a grade one level and so because he cannot 'do' he 'teaches?' He does not teach, he does not inspire; he withholds approval, negatively reinforces and rules by fear, and is feared rather than respected. I would have a difficult time to point to a single (pedagogical) scene in the film that had any merit whatsoever or was worth watching for any reason. Maybe I should say that its evident popularity may be evidence that we are truly living in the end times... ha!  See the film if you want to be current, but please decide for yourself from watching it and don't believe the hype about its 'genius' or 'brilliance.' It is not either of those things; it's a poorly written, sad joke.Promoting fascistic perfectionism. It amazes me that a movie that promotes such level of fascistic perfectionism gets so much praise. I say fascistic because the sick perfectionism of Nazis was one of the main reasons they thought it is OK to gas millions of people. If you are not perfect based on our standards you don't deserve to live.  This movie tells us if you are not Charlie Parker I feel free to humiliate you, insult you, hurt you and abuse you, and it is all justified because if you are Charlie Parker you don't mind this level of sick manipulation. What a disgusting message. Yes, the actors did a good job playing these sick characters, and the movie was well made, which makes it even more dangerous.full metal drumming this is played out as if the young musicians are in boot camp. the head teacher is more vicious drill sergeant than music teacher. anyone who has played an instrument will tell you, yes that practise is hard and you have to be committed, but it is always enjoyable and fulfilling. no one in this film seems to take pleasure in playing music. it is so ludicrous, over the top and ultimately just plain corny. they spell out what the film is about in very childish dialogue as if an audience cannot pick up on what the teacher is trying to do. scene after scene of bombastic emotional and physical brutality. any teacher teaching as this sadist does would not last a week, let alone manage to impart any kind of knowledge into his pupils. then we have the ending the kid races against time, survives a head on car collision and still makes it to the gig, (whereupon the teacher has change what they are going to play just for spite, this is the kind of character he has been throughout this one note film,) and then still manages that old clich√© of killing them dead with his boring drum solo. drumming is not about speed its about making melody from skins. Overrated by critics who by now really don't know what makes a good filmExtremely Overrated - all-around horrible Take a cheezy D-list sports movie script complete with the clich√© bullying, demeaning coach with the tormented, misunderstood athlete (reality: narcissistic, self-righteous, arrogant, spoiled and immature child who needs to grow up) -- replace these 2 characters with a jazz music "teacher" and a drum student at an "elite" music academy.  Neither character has ANY redeeming qualities - if the writers thought they were creating complex, intricate characters they failed miserably. The ending only shows how pathetic both truly are. I assume the writers (and anyone giving this film a positive review) felt they reached some great epiphany at the conclusion - they didn't. Only a tired out re-tread storyline completely out of proper context. A jazz drum student and music "teacher" are not soldiers in boot camp and learning to play drums is not a physically demanding, super- human endeavor as this film tries to lead you to believe. In reality the "teacher" is a glorified conductor who thinks he's something special but does nothing but destroy his students desire and passion. He is also an admitted complete failure at his misguided goal of creating another Charlie Parker. The "student" is equally self-absorbed and rude excuse for a human being. Only thing positive is he seems to be a pretty decent jazz drummer - but that's it. Character has absolutely ZERO going for him other than that. Other than that he's completely disrespectful and dismissive of everything and everyone else. This film (along with Birdman) sums up how pretentious Hollywood is and the excrement they promote at awards shows to convince themselves they have some higher "intellect" or "artistic genius." No one will remember Whiplash or Birdman other than as an embarrassing side note in Oscar history (remember Shakespeare in Love, didn't think so - Google it).The Glorification of Bullying in Film and Sanctioned by Hollywood I was very surprised to see this movie do so well at the Oscars. The movie in a nutshell, to me, is exactly how NOT to teach anyone anything. The story walks you through a jazz class with a Drill Sergeant for a teacher that physically and verbally abuses his student in the name of greatness. The key message is being supportive, respectful and compassionate will get you nowhere. Hitting, abusing and destroying people will make your great! Hollywood for years has been advocating against bullying and now they give not one but three Oscar to a movie that glorifies Bullying??!! I was dumbfounded and sad. Yes, the performance s are great and the actors are very good, but no degree of acting should justify glorifying this method of teaching. What I hated most was that the movie made me like Jazz less. If this is what it takes to have great Jazz musicians then we do not need Jazz. Just to be clear. Hitting, screaming, psychological warfare, abuse and negativity DO not create great people or better musicians. They create abusive, disrespectful human beings that will continue the hate and the abuse. No wonder suicide rates for young people are high; if you are not good enough you are not worth playing, studying, living, etc. Just kill yourself. A very bad message to kids, students and teachers. Dreadful, Hollywood should be ashamed.Good Job First of all, English is not my mother tongue. Excuse me for the mistake I made in this review. Every one seems to like this movie. It is weird that many people seems to avoid to talk about the message or don't think this movie have any massage at all.  But for me the message is loud and clear: You must Insult, humiliateÔºå mentally abuse and physically violate your student to make them good. That's the only way to encourage them to achieve greatness. As a student you must take any advantage you can, no matter what it is going to cause. Remove everything except the thing you want to master from your life FOREVER, otherwise you are not going to be successful.  There are lots of things in the movie that state these message clearly. The most obvious one is the ending. Both Andrew and Fletcher achieve their goal. They achieve it beautifully. Andrew did a improvisation at the end and create his own music. Fletcher get his Charlie Parker. Detail like the poster in the school, says something about end up in a rock band. The fame of Fletcher's band in the movie. Every single effect that Fletcher occur to Andrew like in a scene, Andrew describe other drummer's performance as this s**t.  Some information that state the disadvantage of Fletcher's way of teaching are blurred out. such as the Death of a student that I forget his name. Student that Fletcher send out the classroom are never seen again. Fletcher's impact to other student. Those information mentioned in the movie disappear immediately.  People who find these message and buying them certainly never been through a teacher like Fletcher or at least doesn't been through for a long time. I jump to this conclusion because I did, and I know what kind of damage Fletcher's way of education will do to the student for a long period of time.  When I was about 10 years old, I had not one but three teacher just like Fletcher for two years. I was in my primary school back in China. Violence is the most usual way of their punishment. we got beaten after we didn't do very well on homework, misbehave on class (usually talking and not paying attention), I once broke my arm during these days. At the time I actually like they use violence, because nothing come close when they decided not to use it. When they insult you they never run short of fancy words even we are just kids. I hope I translate them more correctly so you can understand them better. Ones I have a classmate that didn't do well on their homework about handwriting. The teacher says these word in front of 46 kid: From now on, your name is piece of s**t (my classmate's last name) because your handwriting is s**t. and your parents are big s**t. they should be regret about f**k 10 month before your birthday, because you are not worth it. That is one of the thing they said that I remember the most. and after that, little s**t become his nick name. he accept it and we make fun of it. And humiliation . that is for every one who didn't "do well" on their test. Every morning before class. A question well be asked to everyone in the class:"who is the one that get the lowest score?" after that the kid that get the lowest score will be forced to say:"I am a worthless piece of crap, everything I know is to eat and s**t." If any of these thing don't make you think about Fletcher, I don't know what will. In fact I fell Fletcher is a saint compare to them. because those kind of torture last 2 years long and I was a 10 year old kid. Here come the worst part.At first those insult works very well. After a long time I start to accept every word they say. Remember I said my classmate accept his nickname little s**t. I start to accept I am a idiot, I cant do anything right, I am worthless and pathetic. Those word don't make me fell I am willing to break the barrier any more. instead they become a relief. An excuse for not doing well. After over 10, I sometime still fell the same way. I find a psychological statement that describe it very well called Learned helplessness. I am no psychologist so someone please tell me if it's true or not. Back to the movie review. I don't think Andrew is making any sense according to my experience. And this movie is a training course for a**holes.  1/10 Good Job for harming the director the most.Pay no attention to this review, because almost everybody loves this movie. The good parts: The movie is very sensitively filmed. The camera relentlessly explores every bump on Teller's and Simmons's heads like a documentary about Greek sculpture. It adds a lot to the feel of the movie in a wonderfully subtle way. Simmons and Teller (as the "Studio" band director and the, I guess, protagonist young drummer) do a great job. Simmons in particular is really the nexus of energy for the entire movie, and owns that role with absolute precision. The music, when it's actually music, is well-chosen and well-performed. The terrible parts: Simmons ("Fletcher") and Teller ("Andrew") are essentially the only characters in the film. Andrew's dad and his not-really girlfriend are secondary characters that serve to remind the audience what actual humans are like. Andrew is an insufferable jerk, and Teller does an amazing job of maintaining (mostly) a stone-faced, blankly insensitive look throughout almost every tense moment of the film. Simmons's Fletcher is a superb sadistic maniac. He's not "intense" or "volatile" - he's a psychotic monster. I'm debilitated as a reviewer because my son is a talented young drummer, so I get to see good drumming all the time. The persistent trope in the film of Andrew drumming until his hands bleed is wildly unrealistic; that basically cannot happen if you're a drummer good enough to get into a prestigious music school in the first place. Everything else about Andrew at the fancy school, upon further examination, is completely unreal. He basically never talks to the other complete non-entities in the band. They're all like POWs, obeying the maniac director unflinchingly (except when they fail, when they're abused and ejected). My son (whose judgment I trust because he's also obsessed, but not a jerk) described the silly drum "competition" as "three people who can't drum doing shitty grind-core break beats". (To be fair, he liked the movie. What can you do.) So OK, the movie is an allegory, and not intended to be realistic. So it's an allegory about how a sadist can really help a self-absorbed jerk with some obsession get better at what they want to do? I can't find any way to sympathize with that. I mean, who is that speaking to? Finally, the actually appropriate and yet irritatingly obtrusive product placement (pristine cymbal labels, super-clean Zildjian logo on Andrew's stick bag, etc) got pretty hard to take by the (truly weird) ending. Go see this movie because everybody else thinks it's great, but if you feel funny afterwards maybe this review will offer some comfort that you're not alone.Unrealistic I just can not understand how this movie does get so much acclaim. The whole movie is just so unrealistic. I have learned and practiced 2 instruments here in Europe and can only say when I watch how this Shaffer character treats musicians like football players, this would never work. In such an environment any musician would get so tense and so full of fear to fail, he would certainly do exactly that. This is not how musicality and technique is teached. Never. Music is not sports. What Shaffer does may create a robot band that plays precise like a computer. But the music that comes out that way will sound alike. People in music are sensitive. Teaching is a process of mutual understanding, respecting and elevating between teacher and student. Further, a good drum technique with speed is not achieved by such tensioned convulsion, it needs the right finger and hand control and swing. The acting is certainly admirable but the cuts are sometimes worse then just distracting.Jazz fiction (biased but educated review from a jazz drummer student) I give 3 points because: -the movie is entertaining (wich for me is a major factor) i take seven because: -The plot is 100% unbelievable. -The idea portrayed here that to get better at jazz drumming (or for that matter any music genre and any musical instrument) you have to injure yourself, suffer psychologically and practice with tension in your hands/arms is exactly the opposite of what playing/practicing jazz drumming is. The only way to get better is practicing relaxed an being constant...improving in baby, but solid steps. -There is a special accent on playing fast as hell as a mean to be considered "the greatest", and also indirectly in the importance of reading musical scores, when in reality, jazz drumming is a lot more about feel and dynamics, , creativity, coordination and improvisation (without reading any musicl score at all but knowing the form of the song and listening to the other players to interact in the moment). So the movie is a fiction, but not tagged as if. The only thing that can relate with reality is that it can be considered a caricature of a very turbulent student-teacher relationship. Also can be considered a good way to show teachers and students WHAT NOT TO DO.Asco profundo No os dejeis guiar por las criticas. Una basura de peliculaRare The only movie as a grown-up :) that literally had me on the edge of my seat. I was enthralled from start to finish. Fantastic!Great movie!! What a beautiful movie, this kind of movies made me start watching musical movies, simply one of the greatest movies that I'll never forget.In 1 word... Orgasmic An incredible duel between a drummer student and a bandmaster teacher. Exciting, passionating, orgasmic !A real disappointment How did this film get 3 oscar ... I still wonder. Without a story, if not that of a guy who thinks he's becoming a drummer with speed sessions, (which does not express a true drummer) just to please a psycho-sadist what it's actually playing. Not the technique but the transport that can give during the execution of a piece. Plotty and barren in history. A film that I discourage everyone, unless you want to stop playing definitely. I do not say this out of anger towards a bad "master" (Hartman), on the contrary, that was the most interesting part (not to fall asleep). Appointing a Rich Buddy without mentioning a Gene Krupa ... another serious mistake. in short, a flop!Utter nonsense I'm halfway through this film and don't think I've ever seen such a load of utter nonsense. As a professional musician myself, it couldn't be less realistic in my experience. Whilst some of the themes ring true, it's otherwise a totally false picture of life at a music conservatoire and the music business, and I don't think I can bring myself to even bother watching the rest of it! AVOID!Are you people nuts? Seems almost everyone likes this movie for some reason. My review will be short and sweet: This is the dumbest premise for a movie I've ever witnessed. This is "Full Metal Jacket" with drums. No one, and I mean NO ONE would put up with the abuse that this music teacher dishes out, unless they were in the Marine Corp. It's one thing to be a nasty music teacher, but quite another to be R. Lee Ermey as Gunny Sgt. Hartman. Every kid I know today would have pounced on Fletcher and beat him to a pulp if he acted this way towards them. I keep waiting for Andrew to turn into Pvt. Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Lawrence with a rifle in his hand to blow the teacher away. No, this is beyond fantasy, this is just dumb.Brilliant..! what I saw? I saw a single interpretation , a single actor playing the movie.. j. k. Simmons ... Just brilliant.. nothing more to say... 8 stars because it was just about him, everything .. Him.. the young guy, Miles Teller.. was good, a 19y.o. boy that wanted to be The best, but a super talented maestro could and could not agree and let him live the dream.Terrible film with unlikable characters One of the worst movies we've ever seen. Any great story needs to have characters that you actually care about and that you can relate to. But this story has nothing but a**holes as characters. Apparently, we're supposed to be rooting for the kid who wants to be a drummer, but he treats EVERYONE like crap -- he treats his family like crap, he treats his girlfriend like crap, he treats fellow students like crap. He isn't nice to anybody the entire film. We also have no idea WHY he wants to be a drummer so badly -- we know literally NOTHING about him the entire film. Similarly, the teacher is portrayed as the worst human being on planet earth, so we obviously don't care about him either. Therefore, we're left with a movie about 2 a**holes competing to be the biggest a**hole. It's really surprising that such an unlikable and terrible film got such rave reviews, but that just shows you that Americans can no longer distinguish good films from bad films anymore.Rocky for the 21st Century This can only be understood in the light of Rocky winning best picture at the 1976 Academy Awards. This is your standard inspirational movie. You can almost time to the minute that the 'girlfriend' appears. It's a movie aimed at people who are inspired by motivational speeches, where every aspect of the speech is predictable. But many people like predictability, that's the attraction. This movie is the predictable inspirational movie with a few alterations. The teacher is the enemy and there's some shades of grey sadism. And it's about jazz, not boxing. In many ways it could be a parable of our times. Gone is the brawler from the working class, instead we have a middle-class white person wanting to play jazz - a nearly dead art form, kept alive by music schools for middle-class white people. The middle-class white person is now achieving heroism. Overcoming your background is now an existential experience, not a reality. In terms of jazz, it's a million miles away from the black people who dominated this art form: Billie and Ella, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Mingus and Monk. It's closer to modern classical music: gone are the days of Rossini and Puccini writing brilliant music to earn a living, instead we have piano competitions. Of course, if the student was black, it wouldn't have a market. Well, actually the student probably wouldn't be black to begin with. Black jazz is dead. Long live middle-class white people 'fighting' for a shot at 'perfection'. Can you imagine Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell in some kind of 'duel' to see who could out-do each other on a piano? This is the 45th best film of all time, according to voters. What times we live in. This film makes Eddie Murphy in Beverley Hills Cop look like hard realism based on a Pulitzer Prize winning piece of journalismThe worst goddamn movie, infuriatingly bad I knew that Damien Chazelle was overrated after witnessing the immense hype over La La Land. It was good but not 8.3 good. This movie certainly is not 8.5 good. It's utterly disgusting to me that this movie received such high praise. I can see what it aimed to do but it failed so miserably in my eyes. I can't fault the cinematography. The performances, I admit were also spot on, both Teller and Simmons are clearly good actors (even though I've never seen Simmons play anything but a barking dog). The entire movie I was waiting for a moment where the tyrant would crack or be punished or change, but it never came and by the end, I hoped to see him get hit by a truck too. When that lawyer showed up I thought 'finally! That kid's gonna stop that bastard from abusing him or anyone else' but he was like 'whatever, do what ya want'. Queue truck number two. I don't understand how a movie that condones and encourages the absolute disregard for human rights can be rated so highly; I don't understand how the misogyny and homophobia are brushed over. Someone killed themselves because of that jerk and he still doesn't regret any of his actions. Chazelle is obsessed with ambition (and with jazz) and he prioritizes it over humanity and love which I can't stand. He makes his characters self-centered and selfish in the name of ambition and art. He sure has a way of making me not care for the protagonists. I mean, what does it matter if you are a household name and made really great music -or any other type of art- if you were a bad person? What the hell is the meaning of a nice-sounding jazz song if there is no beautiful feeling behind it? This movie's ultimate message is that to be an artist you must abandon your humanity and loved ones and that is something I cannot accept. This movie has given me a headache and it's not just because of the loud drums.Gave me the thing I needed I am a musician too but -you know- in a kinda pop-rock band and I actually felt so empty and pointless about the music I make. That film gave me the INSPIRATION and the feel of strength. Made me to look from a different perspective -what a clich√© but that is true! THANKS for that last scene although it was not totally unexpected it was satisfying. I got what I wanted from that film. Thanks for giving me what i need, thanks for helpingNot bad but overrated Whiplash may seem like an very original movie but really the story line is very shallow. I honestly just don't see where the story is going in Whiplash and at the end there seem to be a "meh" feeling of disappointment. Whiplash however does have its moments and the acting is phenomenal. I like the intensity and drama associated with Fletcher but story line wise there really is not much too it. Although don't get me wrong because Whiplash is a quality movie is just that the story it's pretty disappointing. So my advice to you on watching this movie is that don't expect too much from it because you really won't get anything out of it.Drums, drumming and drummer. I precisely put what this film is about. Drums, drumming and drummer. I precisely put what this film is about. There is a kid in his twenties who joins the so-called best music school in America and it's about how he goes about his passion that is Drums. Drums are percussion instruments that make a lot of noise if not played well. But here, they seem to have been played to the beat. Okay, now let me give this to all the jazz lovers. If you are going to watch with an expectation to learn or know more or to understand jazz music, stay away, please. Except for few mentions of Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong, Buddy Rich and a few more, this film has not got any jazz. In the garb of jazz, it has got music that is as good as any other film with no greatness added. The movie is more about abuse of power and authority than Jazz for sure. Not one frame I saw can be termed "musical". The acting is superb above all else. The whole outlook is dark and I was very surprised because that's so not music. Perhaps, it deals with dark emotions thus, it is set dark. I am going with a 3/5 for a good one, but only for some good acting. All else is just OK.Outstanding film! I was around a year late to watching Whiplash because I honestly wasn't drawn in by the idea of a film about drumming, it didn't seem like my thing. After seeing many great things about this film I gave it a go and it was one of the best decisions I made. Whiplash has fantastic characters with two that absolutely stand out, Miles Teller's character Andrew is played brilliantly and I was rooting for him all the way through without a doubt. J.K Simmons brings an outstanding and intense performance and for me was one of the best supporting roles I have ever seen. The films tension is fantastic and there are so many gripping parts and even near the end I was sat drumming to myself because I was so hyped and excited. Overall the film is fantastic with great performances, great directing and a gripping story.A must watch! "Whiplash" is cinematic adrenalin. It is a deeply personal and vibrantly alive drama. Damien Chazelle has taken a relatively unadventurous subject like the relationship between a music student and his teacher and turned it into a thriller built on a social perspective of what it takes to make it in an increasingly competitive and cutthroat world. How far are you willing to push yourself to succeed? How far are you willing to push someone else to force them on the path to success? Carried by two electric performances, "Whiplash" is as breathless as a drum solo, rising and falling just as the hopes and dreams of its protagonist climb and crash. A young man named Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) is practicing late at night at his New York music school, when his drumming catches the ear of the infamous Mr. Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), the most important teacher at the school and the conductor for its most important jazz band. Fletcher pauses, listens, barks a few orders at the young man, and moves on, seemingly dissatisfied with what he heard. Andrew goes back to his routine class band, telling his dad that his opportunity to move up probably passed him by. Of course, Fletcher's dismissal of Andrew in that first scene is just the first of many examples of what could be called his "teaching style." Fletcher likes to tell the story of how Jo Jones threw a cymbal at Charlie Parker's head one night when he messed up, thereby pushing him to the breaking point at which he became Bird. Without that cymbal, would music history be the same? Would Charlie Parker have gone home, refined, practiced and driven himself without the threat of not just failure but physical violence? Fletcher uses that kind of barbarous technique on his students: throwing furniture, calling Andrew names, playing mind games and physically torturing him with repetitive drum solos until he bleeds on the kit. But that blood feeds his musical passion. And Andrew blossoms, asking out the cute girl he's been afraid to talk to before, and taking first chair in the most important band at the most important music school in the country. Miles Teller, so great in breakthrough roles in "Rabbit Hole" and "The Spectacular Now," does the best work of his young career here as Andrew. He is naturally apprehensive, but he also knows he has a drive, a passion, a skill that is unique. Teller walks that line, never faltering by making Andrew too confident while also carefully letting viewers see the spark within that Fletcher fuels. Even after the kind of inhumane mind games and physical abuse that should produce legal charges has unfolded on screen, we find ourselves drawn to Fletcher. He's not 100% wrong when he says that the most dangerous two words in the English language are "good job." Whether you think it's the right approach or not, we're in an era of praise, where encouragement is the teaching tool and every kid gets a medal for participation. Have true talents been left to wither because they were over- watered? Simmons perfectly captures the drive of a man who believes his abusive degree of pressure is the only way to produce a diamond. While "Whiplash" would be a notable film purely for Teller and Simmons' performances, it reaches a different level when one considers the execution of its tempo. Editor Tom Cross and cinematographer Sharone Meir often put us right on stage with Andrew and Fletcher. It is captivating, to say the least, particularly in a climax that produces more tension than any action film or thriller this year. The title refers to a song played multiple times throughout Chazelle's film. It could also refer to that sense of wowed exhaustion you'll feel when it's over.My one and only review: Best movie ever for me !!! Whiplash is the best movie ever for me. I am writing this review just because this movie made me to write it. No film inspired me this much to write a review here on IMDb. Everything was perfect about the movie. This movie is a powerful example of extraordinary filming which can inspire a generation of filmmakers and I mean it. It is important for me to say that this movie left behind The Godfather for me. Music, Acting, Direction and story. Loved this movie. What can I say more? Literally, actually the best movie ever. Last scene was great. When you think the movie is done, it takes a surge and you are drowning in excellence. I was feeling every beat in veins. I increased the volume of my computer to max (Thanks to vlc player, IYKWIM). Indian education system's convention of Guru (teacher) and Shishya (student) has depicted by this movie in an over-the-top manner. I loved the film. Going to watch it again. I owe you Director Sahib! BEST movie ever!!!Masterpiece set in the jazz universe This film is about a promising young drummer studying at the best musical college of the country and his conflicted interaction with his teacher, played by J.K. Simmons.  Simmons plays an abrasive, almost sadistic tutor, who pushes his students far beyond the line, physically as well as mentally, hoping to discover and shape the greatest jazz musician of the 21st century. His motto can be defined in one sentence: " There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'Good job'." Whereas Miles Teller embodies a new student to his class, dreaming of fame and greatness. As one could tell by this premise, their relationship is complex and holds mixed feelings of hope, violence, revenge and mental strength. It's one of the best films I have seen in the past years. The cast as well as the director have done an extraordinary job at catching those feelings on scene. The atmosphere is obviously dark and there is a lot of tension, and even as a spectator, you feel it deeply. I could not stand on my chair without being frustrated, or horrified or letting out gasps of surprise as I was watching it! In conclusion, I highly recommend this masterpiece to everyone! Bonus information: the film was filmed in the incredibly short time of 19 days, shot for 14 hours a day! This adds input on the incredible tension and pressure the movie evokes.Movie of the decade! Watch straight away! This movie was flawless, my favourite movie ever! The acting was brilliant and J.K Simmons scared me for days after watching the film, Miles Teller did a great job as playing Andrew. The story had me hooked and the third act had me shaking. If you're into intense dramas, I suggest watching this movie as as soon as you can. It's a great music flick showing how determined Andrew (Miles Teller) is to impress Fletcher (J.K Simmons) and to show that he can be one of the best jazz drummers alive. 10/10 I would definitely watch it again.This is one movie that you must watch this year! I had never quite expected Whiplash to be a strong and independent film, it took me by surprise and swept me off the floor. The movie is one of the boldest in screenplay and acting. Miles Teller plays the character of a dreamy but perseverant drummer. His acting was so good on screen, because for a moment there I forgot that I was watching a movie and got involved in his character so much - I could feel his pain, his loss and his anger to excel. JK Simmons is a truly epic in this movie. Literally, I couldn't take my eyes off him. With an exceedingly true portrayal of an abusive teacher and his motive to find the next Charlie Parker, JK Simmons pulled off one of the best roles off all time and definitely the best in his career. Whiplash never misses the beat, there isn't a single moment wasted and every second feels packed with visual drama.a masterpiece ! this movie is absolutely brilliant ! Even though I'm not really a specialist in movies, I got to say that this one blew me away and is genuinely filmed. I had the best time watching it in HD as it is also very enjoyable to watch thanks to the scenes where the band is playing. Personally it even encouraged me to get back to music ! (I used to play guitar when I was younger) I really encourage everyone to see it as it is a movie for all ages (except for the "swearing" part...) and a stunning masterpiece in its genre! In conclusion, I am happy that i got to know about those two amazing actors : Miles Teller and JK Simmons. I got to appreciate their acting talents as well as their toughness ( during "hard times" in the movie)One Of The Best Music Movies Of All Time This movie was amazing from start to finish, and to think I was gonna say forger it and not watch it for some reason(i thought it would be boring). Now i feel like an idiot for putting it off for so long. There is a good reason why this movie is nominated for Best Motion Picture for 2014 the acting performances are on par if not better than Birdman, Miles Teller oh my god, holy crap who the are you? Where did you come from? just wow enough said. I was dying to see him in Fantastic Four after seeing this, this kid is good, this kid can be great. how he was not nominated for an Oscar boggles my mind, I'm not saying he would have won but he should definitely have been nominated. mind you they didn't nominate Jake Gyllenhaal either and he killed everyones performance that was nominated. #biggestoscarsnuboftheyear anyways I'm getting off topic this film had Great direction great production great sound mixing and a lot of heart and emotion and let's not forget my boy J.K. Simmons who just blew me away with his acting skills that I didn't even Know he had. i mean i knew he was good but this role was great. the best supporting actor was all his for the taking(i think his only competition was Edward Norton in Birdman). any way this movie is a must watch for any movie lover its one of the best if not The best music based movie i have ever seen, maybe even one of the better movies i have ever seen as well 8 / 10A powerful and intelligent movie, the best of 2014 Whiplash was/is a jarring movie to watch. The movie is twisted, humorous, entertaining, and genius. Damien Chazelle's masterful directing puts the viewer into a much more meaningful and sympathetic emotion to all of the characters. The camera work is steady and perfect. The editing was beyond perfect and deserved it's Oscar. This movie is could be an ideal film to study in film classes. The acting in this movie has no flaw or problem to it. The way the camera, directing, acting, and editing was nothing short of amazing. I only hope Damien Chazelle will be making more films just as beautiful as this one. There is not a sin in this film and I erge you to watch this film more than once. This film absolutely deserves ten stars.Only "Boyhood" Was Better 2014 Flick Than "Whiplash" By now, you've surely heard about, or seen the trailer for, Damien Chazelle's latest picture, "Whiplash." That's the one in which veteran character actor J.K. Simmons plays a loud, obnoxious, condescending jazz band director at a prestigious music school. If you're like me, you're not thrilled about seeing this one. A little of that screaming goes a long way. Please allow me to tell you how misguided your decision to skip this one is. At first, Simmons (the father in "Juno") struck me as a jazz band version of R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant character in Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket." In both cases, the attitude is merely theatre, designed to drastically alter the mindsets of young men. But the difference is that Ermey's character attempted to make soldiers of men who might otherwise panic when faced with a life-or-death situation. Ermey's ranting and raving was, in a way, vital to the survival of our nation ‚Äì at least that's the way he saw it. But Simmons? His Terence Fletcher is bellowing at music students ‚Äì not soldiers. Yes, I initially found his character to be way over the top. But I soon realized there was a method to his madness. Fletcher's life was changed when he read about Charlie Parker's drummer, who threw a cymbal at young Parker when he didn't think the future saxophone aficionado was playing up to his potential. From that moment, Fletcher made it his lifelong goal to berate greatness, if you will, from his students. Fletcher is not a guy who ever says, "Good job." He can't be pleased; he can only be impressed. One day, he personally picks a freshman percussionist named Andrew to be an alternate player in his top jazz band. Fletcher sees enough potential that he subjects Andrew to his discordant teaching style in hopes that he may become the next Buddy Rich. What ensues is a fascinating game of one-upmanship, as these two strong personalities do battle against each other ‚Äì Fletcher, to bring the musical genius out of Andrew; and Andrew, to keep from being insulted and dishonored in the process. Still not convinced you oughta pluck down cash for this one? Let me tell you the two leads are out of this world. I wouldn't be surprised to see J.K. Simmons win (not just nominated, but win) the Supporting Actor Oscar ‚Äì even though I think both leads belong in the Lead Actor category, but that's another discussion for another day. And Miles Teller (so convincing in last year's "The Spectacular Now") is every bit as robust in his role as Andrew. In fact, Teller has the same problem Tom Cruise had in "Rain Man." How do you turn in a persuasive performance playing the straight man against a triumph of acting? But in both cases (Teller's and Cruise's), they are able to match the exultation of the actors in the more glamorous roles. Teller certainly deserves a Lead Actor nomination. I'd also be remiss not to mention both the script and the cinematography. Damien Chazelle's screenplay is succinct, a la David Mamet's screenplays. There are no "extra" scenes, no filler material, and the abrupt ending is perfect. Chazelle wisely opts to leave out the denouement scenes, in a story of two individuals who respect one another but don't particularly like one another. And Sharone Meir's cinematography deserves to be nominated as well. The musical sequences are peppered with rapid cuts and edits. Remember Martin Scorsese's "The Color Of Money," in which the camera seemed to concentrate on the rapid motion and beautiful color of the pool balls? Scorsese made the relatively mundane act of two men shooting pool into a spellbinding visual treat. Same thing here. We're not simply treated to watching a twelve-man jazz band belt out a tune. Instead, the camera pops from close-up shots of sweaty, hard-working Andrew with perfectionist Fletcher, interspersed with quick shots of the beautiful, shiny brass instruments. Viewers become mesmerized, as the music seems to crackle right off the screen. It's a real masterpiece of filmmaking, without being "gimmicky," as the long tracking shots were in Alejandro Inarritu's recent "Birdman." In short, "Whiplash" is the best film I've seen since Richard Linklater's "Boyhood" was out this summer. During awards season, I hope "Whiplash" doesn't become a forgotten memory, buried amongst all the big-budget over-hyped cinema of the year. This one's a gem, and I can't wait to see it again.Great film An unforgettable movie full of emotions, spectacular direction and awesome jazz music. The story revolves around Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) , a very passionate drummer, and Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) an intimidating maestro of jazz music. Andrew gets enrolled in one of the best music schools in order to fulfill his dream of becoming top jazz drummer. He is ready to sacrifice everything whether it be his health, relationship or family to become the best. Terence is the most ruthless teacher in the school and he trains jazz to a set of budding musicians. He is infamous for his controversial and extremely pressurizing methods to bring the best out of his students. Seeing Andrew practice one evening Terence picks him up as an alternate for the main drummer in his band and with his dedication and perseverance Andrew grabs the main position.  At many points movie forces one to question Terence's philosophy of achieving utmost perfection. He believes that compliments reduce the scope of improvement. One gets satisfied with whatever he is doing on getting appreciated and this feeling of content hinders further growth. Movie is full of twists and turns complimenting the great chemistry between student and teacher. Movie conveys the message that no matter how many obstacles are present, with true desire one can always find a way to success.Scary...disturbing....a master class in abusive behavior.....but an EXCELLENT film. Well.....one thing's for sure - this movie clearly polarized the reviewers. Numerous 9 and 10 ratings, and a whole heap of 1 to 3 ratings. This alone shows we aren't dealing with an ordinary movie - it's exceptional.  As you can see, I'm with the 9 and 10 ratings - rarely have I seen a more though provoking and challenging movie. It's an essay in obsession and how those who are obsessed can and are exploited by others to fulfil their own needs. Definitely not pretty. Definitely not pleasant viewing. But a compelling examination of manipulation and ruthless behavior, and what it does to the victims. Fascinatingly, a lot of the low-scoring reviews come from people who felt the movie didn't realistically portray what might actually happen in a top (music) school. Or that they felt the manipulation being dished out by the JK Simmons / Fletcher role was too repellent to be true. Seems it just made a lot of people very, very uncomfortable, and they watched behaviors they'd rather believe don't exist.  Two points to that. Firstly, the film is clearly allegorical - I agree that in this day and age it's unlikely that the sort of scenarios described would for a moment be tolerated in any decent, Western school. That said, we see around us in the papers every day a storm of evidence of where the powerful in positions of trust have done essentially what was portrayed in the film, and much worse to boot. So I for one believe that this film is a very valuable examination of the model that can exist where a trusted person in a position of power builds themselves up by tearing down, playing off and humiliating ruthlessly those left in their trust. J K Simmons in my view stole the show. He convincingly created a role of pure evil. Initially he ingratiates himself with the vulnerable young Miles Teller / Andrew role. Naively Andrew believes he may have found a champion. Fairly quickly we see that Fletcher is in fact a very nasty piece of work who thrives in brutally playing off one member of the band against the other. His word is law, and anyone who even looks like challenging him is ruthlessly crushed. He's charming when he thinks it will benefit him (like many narcissists) but exists only to build his own ego at the expense of those around him. Ruthless, abusive, manipulative.....bullying isn't nearly strong enough - he's a psychopath. Sadly - the kids he's dealing with are either too scared of him to react, or they are hoping that they may avoid his wrath and benefit from the "discipline" he exerts. This film's message is so direct and powerful that I'd almost suggest it should be compulsory viewing for all kids in early youth. The "take away" would be....YES...people like this DO exist, and they will destroy anyone who lets a monster like this into their lives. So know what you are dealing with, and absolutely keep your distance.Solid flick Solid flick but not an 8.5. Currently outranking films such as Lion King and Gladiator.You are either the best or you are not to be remembered at all and that's the whole point of this miserable life. This is my second review and English is not my mother tongue, so keep that in mind, would you? This movie has affected me in so many ways that I am not sure I am good enough to express each and every one of them. First of all, anyone who gave 1-5 star to this movie, really?! Go see some chick flicks and entertain yourselves. This movie is absolutely not for such people. Secondly, J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller were so good that I cannot decide which one is the best and the other follows so this movie, as in its original story has two marvelous characters played by most talented actors, one junior and one senior and they deliver and convey every single note of this story perfectly. They actually painted a very difficult yet beautiful "The Master and his student, meant to be one soon" story for us in this film. Yes, the scenes were pretty rough, I did not like them either. There are some disturbing scenes and yes, there is certainly abuse, both verbal and physical in the relationships between Fletcher and his students but that's all about folks. This movie intends to make us see that either you take everything and endure to become perfect in this life or you simply submit to loose. As Andrew says: "I do not want to be great. I wanna be one of the greats". If you just aim to be one great person, find a cuddly thoughtful teacher and dance with him/her. If you want to become legend, find a legendary master who takes no sh.t from you whatsoever. That is the only way you will be molded and become a dazzling sculpture out of an amorph piece of stone. This story tells us that being one in a crowd is no different than being one of the billions of ants in millions of ant colonies and this feeling is the worst a human being may experience. To be nothing is pure suffering and most painful than what you need to cope with in order to chase your dreams. This movie teaches us that giving up should not be an option. Only the best of the best remain and only their names are remembered forever and a human life is worthwhile when this kind of rare miracle happens. Other than that, well most other things are just huge waste of time and energy, sort of. Yeah yeah I know, hard to admit but get over it! So what, alrighty, great musicians, artists etc die younger, some of them at least, what a shame. However the decision also has been translated to us with the words of Andrew: I'd rather be dead 34 year old, drunk and junkie and someone to be mentioned in a dinner table than be alive until 90 years old, sober and someone that nobody remembers my name". Andrew knows his passion was consuming but he did not yield. He did not cede. He did not give up. That's how he won in the end because Andrew knew that being eternal, being immortal only happens when you never cede and this movie is based on that. A dedication and sacrifice can make you...perhaps happy but other than that, there is no solution. Obviously, anyone can choose to be ordinary and be content of this choice in their lives and we should not be judgemental about their decisons but then these people must keep themselves in check in order not to whine about not living a fulfilling life, not chasing their dreams and disappoint themselves in the end or else. They are not allowed smearing good talented people who may become best of the best by sweat, tears and blood. Some of the reviewers accused this movie as Hollywood junk but it is the opposite of it. It tells us that being famous is not the point. Being eternal is. And to be eternal, to write your name in the history of any kind of art, science takes too much effort and then some. A flame, a drive, ambition and courage. Devotion to yourself and your purpose. This is not everyone's cup of tea ladies and gentlemen. That's why we meet just a couple of hundreds of names in acting, music, painting or else among millions thoughout hundreds of years and that's why we are thrilled, inspired and fascinated by these people since these people happen very rare in our dull meaningless lives. We feel good just being witness of their amaze. We do not forget them ever.  I am definitely not a kind of person who is easily moved by fame or prosperity but I am bowing in front of every genuine talent and this movie reminds me how these rare talented people rise up from the worthless crowds. Just like Fletcher says: you have to believe that you have a reason to be here. Another point of the movie, sort of sideway but it is there, so yes, the story is also about that: you should find your own cause, a reason, full confidence of your calling to live a life worthwhile. If a person is strong enough, substantial, hard working, not a quitter, then you can understand that, this individual is also clever and whole enough to decide what his/her calling is. This kind of wholeness deserves respect. Also when Fletcher said to Andrew not to worry about the scales, numbers and what other people think but do what you do, we can see it in the last scene of the movie that, a priceless lesson was finally learned by Andrew, from his master whom he already betrayed for no reason but in the end, the greatest praise was the smile and appreciation in that same master's eyes whom he betrayed. Nonetheless he was forgiven which is a big accomplishment and that smile was the one Andrew was seeking in his whole life, not from anyone else including his weak father. He played the drums like nothing else was more important than that in this world and that's when he reached to a point of delivering a phenomenal peerless solo and that was what Fletcher wanted him to figure out. In some reviews, apparently from people who did not understand a thing from this movie accused the character of Fletcher by being only an abusing, self-important teacher with no legit reason. On the contrary, he was such a solid character who knew what he knew, what his purpose in this life was and he was not apologising for pushing his students because what he believed was actually just like a paper which works for seperating acid from base. That's how you eliminate really good talented people who would take everything to be one of greats or just above mediocre and Fletcher did not have time and energy for mediocre. Indeed, as we can see him playing the piano peacefully in a jazz bar just for sole purpose of pleasure indicated us that he was not such a horrible person. He was sort of a broken man himself. In one of earlier scenes, in fact he sincerely cried for the loss of one of his former students who became a beautiful musician, his words for God's sake, pay some attention guys! These lines are defining the excellence of this marvellous story and movie. When Andrew had an accident and still arrived in the music hall but rejected by Fletcher, I am sure everyone got angry. Well, I am looking from a different perspective: Fletcher warned all the musicians in the band to take at least two hours ahead for possible traffic issues before going to the place where the music event would occur which Andrew did not obey. He also forgot his sticks since he was in a rush which was a huge mistake. And also Fletcher tried to teach him a lesson that sometimes, a person's passion, eagerness would cloud the rational judgement but not everything is about you so you should also be a team player and think about other players first but Andrew was becoming blind because of his obsession and he was not thinking properly. It was a harsh lesson alright but most of the good lessons are. So, short russian of this movie: No extraordinary success, fulfillment and happiness can find you without enormous amount of pain because being one in a million should not be that easy. And I wish this movie was made 20 years ago cause my life could have been totally different but then, director of this movie was three years old, lol. I tbelieve if you want to make a decision in life, you should first watch this special movie. And of course uncountable kudos to Damien Chazelle, a thrilling master indeed who made this movie possible. Thank you Mr. Chazelle, many respects and admiration to you from my humble heart. At this very young age of yours, you have figured it out all! I am taking away one star because other than Simmons, Teller and Reiser (he was protraying a wobbling father figure marvelously) unfortunately the other cast members were unbelievably poor but cinema is a team game too so good job for them. On the other hand, I am standing on my feet and applauding these three top notch actors whose names mentioned above since they have done their jobs flawlessly.  I believe this is a kind of movie in cinema history that would never be forgotten by so many film lovers and high quality audience.Not as far wrong as people seem to think Minor spoilers I know there are already plenty of reviews for this film, but a lot of the low scores are from people who say they don't believe the very premise of the story. I have also studied music. In fact, I am also a drummer. Music school wasn't like this for me, but high school really was. I was never physically struck, but the threat of it was real enough, and the humiliation suffered in front of the other musicians was traumatic and the memory is painful enough more than 30 years later now that this was a hard movie to watch and yet I couldn't look away. This was so close to what I went through in high school that I would easily believe it if someone were to tell me that my high school band career was the source material. J.K. Simmons, amazing in everything, was easily as good here and I could only wish that I could have had the strength of character and self confidence that Miles Teller's character demonstrates in this film. I loved the relationship he has with his father (pleasant surprise performance by Paul Reiser), but the general lack of support from a family that mostly doesn't understand his dream is also totally believable and is pretty common for musicians from a non-musical family. This was one of my favorite movies in a while. I just kept yelling at the screen, "I KNOW!! Right???" See this movie, and BELIEVE it.Not quite my tempo The performances and direction (which earned all my 4 stars) could have made this a great film, but the message conveyed by the storyline was repellent. I watched right to the end, waiting for the dark consequences of the conductor's behaviour, but instead the film validated the abuse.the film's title sums it up perfectly Andrew Neiman is an ambitious drummer who doesn't just want to be great, but to be one of "the greats." Despite being only a first-year student at Shaffer Conservatory in New York City-perceived by many to be the best music school in the country-Andrew is recruited to join the upper level studio band, but to prove himself he's going to have to survive a tenacious battle of wits with Terence Fletcher, a renowned but unrelenting conductor who uses draconian methods to bring out the very best in his students. Intense, exhilarating drama from director Damien Chazelle pulls you in right from the start and never lets up with vigorous acting and top-grade musical numbers on its way to a smashing climax. Teller is compelling as the youthful student pushed to his very limits, while Simmons (who looks like he'd be right at home in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket) gives a brutal, uncompromising performance as his relentless "mentor." A powerful, provocative film about dedication, ambition, and obsession. ***A strong story, very well acted This is one of those films that equals the hype. Just J.K. Simmons alone makes it worth the time, but Miles Teller also breaks out as a bonafide star also. The themes will resonate with anyone who has cared about something so much they'll put up with almost anything do get it. It's excruciating at times, but always with a payoff.This movie is doubleplusdank. To what extent can you immerse yourself in what you do, in order to reach perfection? How far can you go without breaking? And more importantly: should you go that far? This is a story of an extremely harsh mentor and extremely determined apprentice. Two giants, meeting face to face in order to reach perfection.  The conductor's (Fletcher) position is to "push people beyond what's expected of them". He believes that to be "an absolute necessity", a Legend Recipe. For him, "There are no two words in the English language more harmful than "good job".  The drummer's (Andrew) position is to "...rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have people at a dinner table talk about me (him) than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remembered who I (he) was." I find that movie highly motivating, especially for people who play an instrument themselves.  *SPOILERS There's also: *great jazz *either rushing or dragging (I don't really know) *flying chairs *deliberate sabotage of the band *no Mars-bars down there *being upset *bloody drum-kits And more! QI:  I think there should be a whole new language rating system created, just so that movie can be on top, cause "18+" definitely doesn't cut it. J.K. Simmons (Fletcher) won an Oscar for his outstanding performance. Oddly enough, his speech didn't include any swear words.Amazing! An instant classic! Not knowing anything about Damien Chazelle prior to seeing this when it came out allowed me to have very little expectations going into it. Boy was I impressed. After La La Land, it's clear Chazelle is one of the best new directors out there. It's hard to imagine that a movie about a competitive Jazz school could be as suspenseful as this. Teller is terrific and clearly a skilled drummer in his own right. J.K. Simmons' performance is one of the most deserved Academy Award winning performances in a decade. I still remember both my brother and I letting out a deep breathe after one particularly tense scene between Simmons and Teller. If you have not seen this Jazz masterpiece, add it to your WatchList ASAP!One of the most inspirational and energitic film! Every time i just thinking about the struggles we although to make ourselves a proper musician and prosperous in the lifes jouney,but when i wached it ,it was like search in something and finally got it.This is review #572....so is there really any need to say more?! "Whiplash" is a terrific film...no doubt about that. Normally, I'd spend several paragraphs talking about how great it is except that I am the 572nd review and many people have already gone on and on about what a terrific film it is....so what can I add?! It's the 40th highest rated film on IMDb after all!  J.K. Simmons clearly deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor because although he was no the star of the film, he dominated every moment he was on the screen. Was he a likable guy? No way..but he was mesmerizing. Kudos also for the young actor in the lead and everyone else with this film. It's among the best films of the year and one that impressed me so much because it did not have a complicated script of mega-million dollar special effects--it just had terrific acting, writing and direction. See this film and see how a quality film is crafted. 'Nuff said...One of the Best of 2014 Whiplash (2014)  **** (out of 4)  Hard-hitting drama plays out much like a thriller as Andrew (Miles Teller) dreams of becoming a great drummer no matter what the cost is. He ends up attending the best music school in the country and it doesn't take long before he's hand picked by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), the best teacher there who will stop at nothing to get the best out of his students. WHIPLASH is a film that pretty much came out of nowhere and is leaving a major mark on those who see it. I will admit that I hadn't really heard too much about the film but it seems with each passing day there was someone new singing it's praises. Well, having now seen the movie I'm going to join the crowd and tell everyone how wonderful it actually is. I think one of the hardest things to do is take a familiar genre (teacher- student relationship) and trying to bring new life to it. Director-writer Damlen Chazelle manages to do just that because we've seen this type of film several times before but it's done in such a way here that you can't help but feel you're watching something fresh and original. I think one of the biggest reasons it feels fresh is due to the actual subject of a drummer. You'd expect to see something about singers or guitar players but to set this in the world of a drummer and Jazz music was something that works so well because of the wild, frantic style of the jazz score works perfectly well with the work and abuse that the main character forces on himself. The scenes of Andrew working his hands to blood are just so flawlessly edited with the score that you can't help but feel every drop of blood that drips from his hands. Another major plus is the actual editing, which is incredibly fast-pace but falls well short of that MTV-style that has become so worn out the past two decades. Of course, the film's highlight is without question the performance of Simmons who is simply wonderful. Again, we've seen angry people countless times before and we've seen caring teachers countless times before. What's so memorable about the performance here is how quickly Simmons is able to change emotions from caring to pure rage in the matter of seconds. Getting the eyes to tell you what you need to know from a scene is extremely hard but just watch Simmons' eyes throughout the picture. The rage he shows isn't just mindless screaming and cussing because you can still see a certain emotion and caring in his eyes. Teller is also excellent in the role and manages to stand his own against Simmons. Both Paul Reiser and Melissa Benoist are also very good in their supporting parts. What also makes WHIPLASH so memorable is the fact that it really plays out like a thriller. I'm not going to ruin anything that happens but we can see the main character falling apart due to the abuse from the teacher and we know something is eventually going to happen to cause havoc. The film plays this suspense out as if you're watching a thriller and it really pays off in the final twenty-minutes as there are a couple excellent twists. The film certainly has everything you want from a movie and it's clearly one of the best of 2014.Blistering Nominated for five Oscars, and winning three (editing, sound and Best Supporting Actor, with nominations for screenplay and Best picture), 'Whiplash' is positively blistering, with a darker and more realistic view on aspirations and done in a way that's tense and inspirational. Visually, 'Whiplash' looks great with grittily atmospheric photography with plenty of beautiful, gripping shots (like close-ups of the drum playing) and some of the tightest, cleverest and most audacious editing of any film that year. The sound is also thrilling in its intense authenticity, and really add to the impact of the pulse-racing Jazz soundtrack. There is in particular unbelievable drum playing that serves as a fond reminder of iconic drum players of the classic Jazz Age, the final drum solo is long but exhilaratingly played and a huge part of why the ending sends up a storm as much as it does. The script is sharp and cutting, sometimes uncompromising and at other points patient. The story is not new, but makes a point of aspirations and talent having its dark and less glamorous side, competitiveness and that there are always obstacles (including dictatorial bullies). While not quite as extreme in life as shown here situations and people like seen in the film exist. The story is at its most successful in its tension between Andrew and Fletcher, which is thrilling and nail-biting, and Andrew's very relatable and inspiring drive and passion, and much of it is very taut and rarely laborious in pace. Damian Chazelle directs with a clear love for film and the jazz style and passion for the subject. 'Whiplash' has great performances all round. The secondary cast do much with little and Miles Teller more than holds his own in a telling lead performance. This is JK Simmons' film however, proving that his Oscar win was one of that year's most deserved wins. He doesn't just dominate the film with his ruthless manner as a terrifyingly dictatorial character, but actually IS essentially the film, one's terrified of him but also understands his point of view. 'Whiplash' could have been slightly better this said. Most of the supporting cast, especially Andrew's family (the film at least tries to say why the romance was rushed and dropped, in that it didn't mean anything to him like his playing of music did), are severely underwritten and underused. The car crash scene and the aftermath also feels out-of-kilter and even the most committed musician wouldn't be in the right function to do what happens after that scene. Otherwise, this is a blisteringly great film with a huge amount to recommend. 9/10 Bethany Coxterrific performances Andrew Neimann (Miles Teller) is a first year student at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory. His father Jim (Paul Reiser) is a sweet high school teacher. He gets picked by Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) to be the backup drummer in his winning Studio band. He gets enough confidence to ask out Nicole (Melissa Benoist). Fletcher is a cruel manipulative dictatorial teacher. J.K. Simmons gets a great juicy part to show his skills that he has shown all these years. He fully deserves his Oscar win and it's not a surprise. He's certainly done great work in many TV and movie roles before over the years. Miles Teller take a great step up. He has done good work but this is something much more. It's a compelling character who develops and changes. He's able to play through it all.Mindblowing, our generation's "Amadeus" And it does not even need a Best Picture win for this description. Damien Chazelle's "Whiplash" was one of the big players this awards season mounting in three Academy Award wins. J.K. Simmons basically dominated the supporting actor (so happy for him, he is such a likable guy, but was he really supporting?) category from start to finish and Chazelle himself managed a writing nomination with the Academy. Given he just turned 30 and has a bright future ahead of him, I am sure he can live without the director nomination. "Whiplash" is a great film. It starts off good, but quickly has you on the edge of your seat for the rest of the film. They kept it at clearly under 2 hours, which helped a lot as it would have sucked if they had filled the film with unnecessary scenes. This way now, it's really all essential from start to finish. There were a few scenes I struggled initially, like the protagonist breaking up, but in retrospective I have to say it all makes sense now. His self-confidence grows with his dedication for his art mounting in the explosion of his anger when he physically attacks Fletcher (Simmons). Fletcher is possibly this year's most interesting character. No black-and-white as he walks the fine line between genius and insanity in every single scene. One great example would be how he talks to a little girl and asks her gently if she wants to join his band one day and in the next scene he talks to his band the way he always does. The monsters shows again. The ending was great too. I was a bit unsure when they missed a good ending scene when Fletcher asked Teller's character if he wants to fill in in his new band, but the actual ending was at least as good. Fletcher really gets his Bird in the end. By the way, I wondered if he would shoot the young man on stage (nice "Birdman" reference). Everything seemed possible, but the path of the wrong sheet was a brilliant one as well. No doubt that Teller is a real competitor for best actor under 30 right now after his performance here. He would have deserved a lead actor Oscar nomination as well, over Cumberbatch for example. The new "Fantastic Four" makers seem to agree. And Simmons is just a force of nature in this film. He also appeared in Chazelle's short film that this is based on, so great choice for him back then and good job on Chazelle for not giving the part to anybody else. Not many out there who would have been as good. And with said short story background, this project was a true success story that goes way back to a stroke of genius by Chazelle. Now, if you are interested in drumming, let me suggest you Richard Jenkins' "The Visitor", a more silent approach on the issue. Or you could maybe also call it a "Black Swan" for males. Or Fletcher could be categorized as a more radical Dr. House. Anyway, back to this one here. It's my number one or two of the year right now (against Cotillard's Oscar nominated film) and I cannot recommend enough watching it. You will not be disappointed. It's been a while since I had a theater that applauded after the end of the film, but this one did and it was oh so deserving. Each scene a winner and this movie is the perfect example of how a great script is much much more important than a cast that includes the best actors of the planet.Fake, fake, fake My contrary reaction to the phony film WHIPLASH: 1. Fake jazz: Jazz is the vehicle to tell this story, but what we get is not jazz but rather the academic teaching of big band/orchestral music, emphasizing arrangements and perfecting the technique of one's instrument. Same film could have been better scripted about a classical symphony orchestra at a university. Jazz is about improvisation and the interplay between musicians, as seen in a small group context. Big bands as seen here are more evident nowadays at sporting events. The only solo was the hero's mediocre drum solo at film's end. 2. Fake theme/ending: Theme of the movie is the importance of motivation &amp; rigor to promote excellence, in the context of a student, and the pitfalls of the martinet. In movies, for audience manipulation and dramatic purposes a theme is often betrayed at the end, most famous case being Alec Guinness's sudden reversal at the climax of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, because an audience expects the damn bridge to be blown up, even though his character spent the previous 2 hours with every fiber of his being symbolically building it. In WHIPLASH the finale contradicts everything previously in the script, not to be even-handed but to falsely convey a message that "maybe" true artistry and achievement stems from the horrible inspiration we've witnessed. Totally bogus and phony. 3. Fake characters: Given jazz's history, the two major characters - protagonist and antagonist, should have been Black. The filmmakers have every right to make them whatever they want, perhaps a female teacher and a girl drummer would have been interesting, but that also would not have fit the use of jazz as movie's central core. My reaction to the whitened-up story was the same reaction as I would have to a '50s movie biography of Fats Domino played by Pat Boone, whose early career was essentially spurred by the industry (and specifically his record label) customarily ripping of a Black artist (Fats) with a white artist (Pat) singing his songs for a general audience. Same crappy approach here. 4. Fake gimmicks: Many gimmick scenes in WHIPLASH would have been blue-penciled and not made it into the final script had this been a TV episode rather than an independent ("anything goes") feature film -the writers' room would not have permitted them to slip through. Most notable is the hero's car accident and arriving late and bloody to unsuccessfully try and perform at the big concert contest, when the band's other drummer was perfectly capable of going on in his stead. Not merely unbelievable but farcical as directed here. Final reel of him conned into appearing with no charts for songs he had never seen or heard before was an asinine gimmick, almost as stupid as him returning to suddenly lead the orchestra himself, all for fake-dramatic purposes. And maybe even worse the scene that made me want to leave the screening: his blow-off of his girl friend telling her his need to practice and succeed would not leave enough time for their relationship to continue. That must have looked bad on the page and it didn't play at all on the screen. 5. Fake performance: I have praised J.K. Simmons many times, and you can read my rave review for him on IMDb for his role in the obscure comedy NEW IN TOWN. But his facile, surface performance here is just the kind that wins awards (it surely did), but pales into comparison to many others playing essentially the same role. I will merely cite Robert Duvall in THE GREAT SANTINI or Lou Gossett Jr. in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN as the most vivid in recent memory. I found his playing closer to the psychotic of Humphrey Bogart in THE CAINE MUTINY than to what the role called for. 6. Fake icon: Buddy Rich is elevated to god-like status in WHIPLASH, a reactionary and outdated concept that I reject entirely. In show biz history I would nominate Rich for iconic status as a jerk, not a musical artist. In jazz history, the logical icon and role model here would be Art Blakey, since not only is his importance in modern (post-WWII) jazz secure but more to the point he became the archetypal leader and inspiration to hundreds of musicians who graduated from his band, ranging from formative stints for Wayne Shorter and the Marsalis Bros. to little-known connections with artists as varied as Chick Corea and Chuck Mangione, both of whom I saw appear with Blakey's Jazz Messengers in Boston in 1966.. Unlike the teacher posited in WHIPLASH as a Dick Cheney-like nut, Blakey motivated rather than tortured his young acolytes. Buddy Rich and his mediocre '60s big bands yielded nothing, and as a drummer he was all technique and zero jazz. 7. Fake porn: Categorically WHIPLASH (the title is perhaps the key hint) is a type of soft-core pornography, among other things. It's another movie example of the trends in recent years to substitute sadomasochism for traditional sexual porn - namely the thousands of horror films about torture and sadism appealing to the audience to alternately identify with and then hiss the sadist as protagonist, or more recently the oncoming trend that will be inspired by the success of 50 SHADES OF GREY. The movie's domination theme is obvious, but the submission aspect is way more subtle -masked by the hero's natural rebelliousness. Looking beyond him we have a score of submissives -his fellow band mates who are humiliated (a key element of BDSM cinema) throughout the film. This as entertainment is the definition of pseudo-porn, acceptable to the masses because it does not involve "money shots" and explicit penetration making it soft-core rather than hardcore. The absence of sex in WHIPLASH is no different than the absence of actual sex in most BDSM exercises. 8. Fake setting: L.A. substituting for NYC = zero atmosphere.An Emotional Punch to the Gut A promising young drummer (Miles Teller) enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor (J. K. Simmons) who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential. This film will take people by surprise. Few viewers likely care about drumming or jazz music today. And they may think this film, therefore, will have no bearing on them. But it is so much more than that, an emotional punch to the gut that hits hard. Holding this together is the interaction of Miles Teller (who seems to be getting less credit than he deserves) and J. K. Simmons (who is getting the praise he ought to be). So intense, and quite the power struggle. Some have disliked the film for its message. But do they really know what its message is?A Brutal Character A previous reviewer mention Full Metal Jacket, the Kubrick film about the vicious Drill Sergeant who dehumanizes his men, but one of those men in particular. However, in that movie, the young Marine probably had no business being where he was. Here, a young man wants to be a drummer who will be remembered, like Gene Krupa or Buddy Rich. He has awesome ability which is recognized by Fletcher (Academy Award winner J. K. Simmons). His method involves brutalizing and horrifying his charges and humiliating them in front of their peers. People know he's the best there is, but what a price to pay. He justifies his intensity by repeating some incident where another band member threw cymbal at Charlie Parker's head. While this is good entertainment, if we were to look into the successes of many great performers, most of them were never terrorized. The drumwork is astounding, but all the bleeding is pretty far fetched. Ask some drummers you know. The final scene is all Hollywood as most reality goes out the window. Still, if you buy into the possibility that such a psychotic can command these musicians, it's very entertaining. The drumming is beyond belief, although I'm sure there were some strategic cuts along the way.Drum Boogie. Damien Chazelle directed this story of a talented young drummer (Miles Teller) at an elite music school in New York who is browbeaten mercilessly by his instructor (Dr. Emil Skoda, I mean J. K. Simmons). As unpromising as the material sounds, and as autobiographical, it's better than I'd expected. In the third act, Hamlet has this to say:  "So again good night. I must be cruel only to be kind. Thus bad begins and worse remains behind." It applies, not just here but in all training camp films, whether it's the Marine Corps, the Army, the Coast Guard, Navy Flight School, or Harvard Law School. It answers the question: What torture did you go through in order to be successful.  It's not often we see a drummer boy put through the wringer. And, man, does Simmons put Teller through the wringer, one organ at a time. Teller practices until he bleeds over the snare drum. And THAT'S not good enough. The typical arc of a story like this has the resentful tyro becoming more mature, tempered like steel, proud and manly, winding up with both the admiration of his mentor and the pretty girl he's been diddling on the side. Sometimes the mentor must die, as John Wayne did in "Sands of Iwo Jima."  Not here, though. It's the Big Night, the finale, at Carnegie Hall or the Hippodrome or La Scale or someplace. Teller proves his worth -- MORE than proves it -- and Simmons finally gives him the okay, a big French kiss on the lips. No, no, just kidding. Simmons only smiles at Teller after the drummer's stunning performance. One of the best things about the movie is Teller's relationship with his girl, the earnest and sweet Melissa Benoist, a student at Fordham. They get along quite well, but then Teller calls it off because in his pursuit of perfection there is no room in his life for a woman's demands. What an ass. Yet it's an original touch, because when he's achieved success (or given up) he calls her to renew the relationship but she has to check with her boyfriend.  Teller's default position is "put upon." He looks doubtful, sad, mournful even, without a real ability to project anger -- and the script gives him plenty of opportunity.  J. K. Simmons makes the picture. He seems to have taken lessons from R. Lee Ermey in "Full Metal Jacket." He's abrasive throughout, foul mouthed and in your face. Nothing you do satisfied him. "That's not my tempo!" After he's booted out of Julliard or whatever it's called here, he bumps into Teller and explains why he was so nasty.  He claims he was always looking for the next Charlie Parker, a legendary alto saxophonist, somebody who could absorb insults and humiliation and keep on charging ahead, just like Bird did when he started out. You can be pushed beyond your limits and become a genius or you can settle for having done satisfactory work, says Simmons over drinks. "The worst words in the world are 'Good job.'" The climax proves him right. Yet, what a dumb perspective, a hubristic paean to Narcissus. As the proverb says, the perfect is the enemy of the good enough. How much should be sacrificed in the search for perfection? Charlie Parker died of drink and drugs at an early age, and for every Charlie Parker there are one hundred thousand guys who are good enough at their jobs. The music we hear isn't classical or pop. Otherwise we'd constantly be hearing "O, Fortuna" (Ka-boom). Since drums are the featured instrument it must be jazz. And the jazz isn't really inspired either, I hate to say. It's certainly fast and LOUD enough but it's as if every member of the school band were aiming for Maynard Ferguson's excess. I don't claim to know much about music. I'm less familiar with diminished sevenths than I am with diminished fifths, but I know what I like.Whiplash I saw the trailer for this film and thought it looked good and unusually dark, I liked the fact that the star of Spider-Man was getting a more leading role also, and with award nominations and high praise from critics for it I knew it was a must see. Basically nineteen year old Andrew Neiman (Rabbit Hole's Miles Teller) attends the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory music school as a first-year jazz student, his skill is drumming, he inspires to be a great drummer like Buddy Rich, and one day he gains the attention of respected professor and conductor Terrence Fletcher (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning J.K. Simmons), only for him leave the room with no word. Andrew elsewhere olives with his father Jim (Aliens' Paul Reiser) and they often go to the cinema, it is there he is often served by college student Nicole (Melissa Benoist), and he asks her out and they start dating, and not long later Andrew is approached by Fletcher, he is accepted into his band as an alternative for core drummer Carl Tanner (Nate Lang). Andrew arrives early to his first session, Fletcher arrives and the class practise the Hank Levy piece "Whiplash", it is during this that Andrew sees what he is getting himself, as Fletcher is abusive towards the students, mocking and insulting, and when he hears instruments off tune or rhythm off tempo he will hurl a chair, slap and berate. Andrew is determined to impress Fletcher, so he practises constantly at home with his drum kit, to the point where his hands bleed due to sores from the drumsticks, and he breaks up with Nicole thinking she will distract him, and next Andrew attends a local jazz competition, with a misplaced music sheet he claims he can play "Whiplash" from memory and he is promoted to main drummer, however core drummer Ryan (Austin Stowell) from a former class replaces him and he is demoted to alternative. In a following class session Fletcher tearfully talks about talented former student Sean Casey who has died in a car accident, after this the band rehearses Juan Tizol piece "Caravan", but Carl struggles with tempo, so Fletcher keeps him, Andrew and Ryan in the classroom for several hours until they can perfect their playing, Fletcher finally gives core drummer position to Andrew. Andrew makes his way to a competition, but problems arise as first the bus he is on breaks down, so he rents a car determined to make the performance, arriving late he is kicked out by Fletcher for forgetting his drumsticks, Andrew drives back to the car rental office to retrieve them, speeding back his car is hit by a truck, he survives the accident and crawls from the wreckage badly injured covered in spots of blood, he arrives on stage but is unable to play properly, Fletcher tells him he is "done", and Andre attacks him in front of the audience. Andrew is expelled from Shaffer Conservatory music school, a lawyer representing the parents of Sean Casey contacts and explains that Sean hanged himself after suffering severe anxiety and depression, Fletcher's abusive methods are being blamed, Sean's parents want to stop him teaching, Andrew testifies and Fletcher is fired. Months later Andrew sees Fletcher performing in a club, they drink together and Fletcher explains his behaviour, he wants to achieve greatness which is why he pushes his students beyond expectations, he invites Andrew to join his band to perform at a festival concert, Andrew agrees and wants to invite Nicole, but she reveals she has a new boyfriend and cannot come. On stage before the performance, Fletcher tells Andrew he knows he testified against him, the band then begin playing a piece Andrew does not have the music sheet of, leaving him humiliated on stage as he tries to keep up with the tempo. But as Fletcher makes a speech Andrew interrupts with his drumming and he begins playing "Caravan", he cues the rest of the band to play along and Fletcher follows suit, Andrew continues an extravagant dumb solo, playing non-stop, Fletcher is first angry, but during the play of "Whiplash" he supports him throughout, and when Andrew finishes he finally gets a nod of approval from Fletcher. Also starring Chris Mulkey as Uncle Frank and Damon Gupton as Mr. Kramer. Teller proves a fantastic newcomer as the student who will not give up on his drummer dreams and making an impression to his teacher, but for me the film absolutely belongs to Simmons who is a sensational tour de force as the foul-mouthed maestro who thinks nothing of bringing his students to literal bloodshed to make the perfect music, the duo work fabulously against each other, I agree Reiser could have had a bit more to do, but he cannot stand up against the other two. This gives the often made "inspirational teacher" plot a good kick in the face, it's like a cross between School of Rock and Full Metal Jacket, with a drillmaster like composer getting the head of the hero drummer, it is a great combination of terrific music pieces, bad language and blistering mind games and a marvellous script, it will keep you gripped all the way to the showy ending, I cannot say enough much I loved this film, an exceptional music drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay Damien Chazelle, and it won the BAFTA for Best Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay and the David Lean Award for Direction for Damien Chazelle. Outstanding!music and obsession J. K. Simmons has played a number of stern, demanding characters during his career. But he gets the role of a lifetime in Damien Chazelle's "Whiplash". He plays the brutal instructor of a college jazz band. This man resorts to methods that lapse into abuse. In showing these overly aggressive teaching methods, the movie poses the question of what is the right thing to do when encouraging students to succeed. Brutality is understood to be the only choice when readying cadets for a war zone, but when teaching college students how to play jazz? Simmons won a well deserved Oscar for his performance. Although it was for Best Supporting Actor, the movie belongs to him. Miles Teller's performance as the student is truly secondary to Simmons. His character is one of only a few movie characters in history who made me feel as if I was walking on eggshells.Blood, sweat and jazz Protagonist Andrew Neiman is a student at New York's prestigious Shaffer Conservatory. He plays the drums and dreams of being one of the great jazz drummers. The next step to greatness is getting into conductor Terence Fletcher's studio band; Fletcher invites him to attend but when Neiman has difficulty with the tempo of 'Whiplash', Fletcher tears into him¬Ö at one point he even hurls a chair at him! It is clear that Fletcher expects perfection and will bully and cajole his students to get it. Neiman refuses to back down and practises till his hands bleed¬Ö will this be enough to impress Fletcher though? Every student knows that they are replaceable as despite his reputation everybody wants to be in Fletcher's band. Before watching this film I'd seen a few clips and thought I probably wouldn't enjoy it as Fletcher appeared to be such an overbearing character¬Ö who wants to watch somebody being bullied for an hour and a half? Thankfully when I watched it I realised it was far more than that; Fletcher be one of the most intense teachers depicted on film but thanks to J. K. Simmons's brilliant performance he isn't unlikable¬Ö his methods may be questionable but it is clear that he wants to help his students discover their inner greatness even if only a few will have what it takes. Miles Teller is also great as the equally intense Neiman¬Ö the student who will do what it takes to be the number one drummer¬Ö even playing minutes after a car crash that leaves him battered and bloody! The intensity of the music matched that of the situation. The rest of the cast are impressive enough but it is these two that the viewers will remember. Overall I'd highly recommend this although it is an intense experience and won't be for everybody.who knew Many of us have watched J.K. Simmons sail through film and television for years. And to think, all this time he had this kind of ability. It reminds me of Melvyn Douglas, second banana in dozens and dozens of films, playing similar roles, and then suddenly becoming one of the greatest actors of our time with Hud and I Never Sang for My Father. Miles Teller and Simmons star in "Whiplash," from 2014 and, no surprise to anyone, Simmons took home the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. He plays Fletcher, a sociopathic, manipulative instructor in a music conservatory who abuses his students psychologically.  Teller plays a young man. Andrew, who wants to be a great percussionist, better than any of them, including Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker. He tolerates the abuse and becomes arrogant with success, only to be humiliated by Fletcher. It is a deep psychological battle of wills. If you haven't seen the film, you will not believe the lengths that Andrew goes to in order to be on stage as first drummer. There's a nice turn here by Paul Reiser as Andrew's father. Having been a musician myself and having been psychologically abused by several teachers, I can tell you that this kind of torture is terribly destructive. The only survivors are people who are driven and willing to give everything they have to their music at the expense of everything and everybody else. Is Andrew one of them? You'll have to decide for yourself. Great soundtrack, powerful acting from Teller and Simmons -- this low- grossing film proved to be a real winner."You're done." With this picture coming out about a year ago as I write this, and the last few months demonstrating how more and more college campuses are clamoring for 'safety zones' and students finding even the slightest uncomfortable situation offensive, I have to wonder how someone like Fletcher would survive as an instructor today. As Fletcher, J.K. Simmons manages to demonstrate all the worst characteristics of, forget about teachers, but of human beings altogether, on a par with someone like North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, and he had family members executed when they couldn't keep a beat. Seriously, even though I don't have a musical ear per se, how can one tell if a drummer is drumming too fast or too slow after two seconds, maybe less? That poor schmuck in the orchestra who got tossed when the other guy was the culprit probably went and committed suicide too if the story had followed him out the door. Fletcher's rants about perfection went beyond summoning inspiration and degenerated into nothing less than physical and emotional abuse. That Andrew put up with it and devised his own revenge may not have been the best way to deal with a monster like Fletcher, but at least he came away with a shred of dignity. This is an intense film and if you're not expecting the drama that goes with the story you'll be taken aback by the characters, situations and language that emanates from the players. I think it's a worthwhile film to see if one can keep a perspective on what it takes to achieve mastery of a subject without falling victim to abuse and risking one's health and sanity to do it. Both of the principal players are dynamic and excellent in their roles, and I couldn't help noticing that in certain scenes, Miles Teller had just the right look for the lead role in a movie about the Elvis Presley story.Carrot and stick What a performance or better performances. It was about the time JK Simmons got recognized (read won an award)! And it couldn't have been a more rewarding role than this. If you are used to your typical musician against all odds film, be aware that this is anything but this blueprint you are used to. We're talking about a power performance (no pun intended) that has been already spoofed a lot, only to show the love for the passion this project had. It is so draining watching some of the stuff, you can only begin to imagine how stressful it must have been for those involved. There is not much light in this, but there doesn't need to be - it's perfect just the way it is (or is it?)Best Picture nominee, features a young college drummer with ambitions of greatness. The movie starts with a drummer in action in a band room at the end of a long, dark hallway. It is the first encounter between student Miles Teller as Andrew and teacher J.K. Simmons as Fletcher. Andrew is a student of great drummers, in a pizza joint with a girl he names the 1930s song playing and the drummer in the band. Attending this prestigious private music school in NYC is to be his springboard to greatness. But while he knew of Fletcher he didn't know what a wild man Fletcher was. Seemingly out of control in his over-the-top criticism of musicians who may be off just a little. And using ethnic and gender slurs to berate them. Such behavior probably would never be tolerated in a real school but it is necessary for the resolution of this story. Paul Reiser is good as the dad, Jim Neimann and cute Melissa Benoist (of Glee and the next Supergirl on TV) is Nicole, a girl Andrew starts dating but stops because he says it will not be compatible with his drive to be the best. JK Simmons won the Oscar for Best Supporting actor and the movie itself was in the running for Best Picture. Many fans think it should have won over "Birdman." The movie is hard to watch at times but it all pays off in the final couple of scenes.  SPOILERS: After weeks of on-again, off-again verbal abuse Andrew snaps after failing to perform well after an automobile accident right before the performance. He rushes Fletcher on stage, tackles him, both are bloody, Andrew is kicked out of school. But a family representative of a former student who hanged himself convinced Andrew to witness to Fletcher's behavior, and he was terminated. But in an accidental meeting Fletcher asks Andrew to play drums for a gig, actually setting him up for failure by opening with a number Andrew did not know and didn't have the music for. However next Andrew began to play a hot number, stood up to Fletcher, had the other musicians come in, maybe Fletcher finally had his star.J.K. Simmons deserved his Oscar for his performance in Whiplash Just watched this on Netflix disc with my mom. She was perhaps puzzled by many scenes especially the ending. She certainly wasn't in love with J.K. Simmons' pretty sadistic music teacher character. Simmons' Oscar-winning role does show quite the range of emotions concerning his wanting his students showing how much excellence-according to him-he wants to get from them. His recounting the story of Charlie Parker and of a former student who died-which he says happened one way but we find out later it was in a much different way-does humanize him in a way that one would feel for him. And Miles Teller is great as the one student who seems obsessed with this teacher in trying to achieve greatness. I also liked his scenes with Paul Reiser as his father. The one question one should probably ask is if the ends of the way the movie goes on justify the means that it achieved when it got there. So on that note, I highly recommend Whiplash.Intense But The Hype And Awards Possibly Work Against It Do you know who I am ? " asks the film's protagonist as the audience are introduced to him  Yeah you're that Nazi dude who enjoys raping all the new arrivals at the Oswald State penitentiary . Yes JK Simmons is back playing an Oscar winning role which isn't all that different from the role OZ fans know him for . It's nice to see that this years Oscar nominations were heavily in favour of indie cinema . It's even nicer to know that this is the film my fellow members of this site was the pick of the crop from 2014 film releases so sat back hoping to get blown away by it So is it any good ? Yes but I should quickly qualify this by stating it's not really the masterwork some people might claim it to be . One criticism THE HURT LOCKER received was that you could easily rework the story as someone who has become addicted to adrenaline . Instead of a bomb disposal man you could have the story involve a fireman who takes more and more risks and so it's the same with WHIPLASH . How about a brutal drill instructor trying to turn weak civvies in to efficient killing machines ? That's already been done a hundred times before and so here we've a reworking of a familiar story in a slightly unfamiliar setting of a music school . It's a slightly predictable story and in order for it not to be so predictable there's a few plot turns involving situations that become rather contrived and unlikely to say the least  What stops it all falling apart is director Damien Chazelle using all the tools at his disposal involving editing , sound mix and cinematography to disguise the flaws in the story telling . Certainly many directors nowadays think editing revolves around taking as much cocaine as possible while mutilating any coherent on screen action . The editing style of WHIPLASH is some what showy but is genuinely admirable at the same time . It's nice to actually watch a film and notice the editing while never being irritated by it WHIPLASH is one of the better films of 2014 but it's probably a film that's easier to admire than to like . I did like it but didn't love it and I'm not in a great hurray to watch it againI like to teach the world to play Good Job are the key words for Whiplash. J K Simmons psycho jazz teacher, Terence Fletcher recounts a story about Charlie Parker and how doing a good job was not enough to uncover a genius. There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job' according to Fletcher. The trouble is Fletcher would not recognise a genius if it crashed into him head on. Simmons creates a monster of a teacher which to be truthful is not unknown in coaching circles in sports and the arts. However a good educator he is not, something his prestigious school seems not to have noticed. Miles Teller plays Andrew Neiman the put upon jazz drummer in the Shaffer Conservatory in New York. Eager to impress Fletcher and confounded that nothing he does can satisfy Fletcher. Neiman literally is driven to the edge. However there is only ever going to be one winner, Fletcher does not give an inch. J K Simmons won a best supporting actor Oscar for his mean and blustering performance. There was very little shade to his performance and even in his subdued moments his character was calculating. A man with little ethical core. It is left to Teller to bring soul to the film. The young student whose zest and passion for learning and improvement is fast fading away as he becomes the victim of intense bullying. The film never addresses the bullying by Fletcher. There is a sub plot about this later in the movie but notice how the other students just stay quiet and let the abuse unfurl. Given that cooperating with each other in music is so important, these students hardly talked to each other. They were reaaly a dysfunctional band who certainly did not give a shoulder to lean on which came across as unrealistic. Surely the students would mutter to each other in the canteen as to how horrible Fletcher was? As to the competition which causes Neiman problems as he has trouble getting there. Again you would have thought the Conservatory would had provided transport rather than rely on the students to make their own way. I did not think the film succeeded. The performances were intense but the screenplay had problems because the I never could buy into the band members as functioning students.Sticks And Stones ... I'm going to aim for a little perspective here. If you click on my user name you'll see that this, when posted, will be the 2650 th film that I've reviewed on IMDb; a little over two and a half thousand movies may seem a fair amount but it's really a drop in the ocean. I joined IMDb in 2003 and became active more or less immediately so now we can factor in another figure, two and a half thousand films in eleven years. but we're still miles off because I was already an adult when I joined IMDb. I was probably carried into my first cinema by one or both of my parents around the age of three and by age five I was able to distinguish genres, actors, etc. By ten I had - for a layman - a pretty good working knowledge of how the things worked. I watched most stuff and good distinguish between Warners, Fox, Metro, Columbia, Paramount, RKO etc, with the best of them. I had little taste for horror, sci-fi. didn't mind the occasional Western but was more at home with mellers, straight drama, comedies, musicals, bio-pics if they dealt with songwriters (Night And Day), performers, (The Jolson Story) or , peripherally, jazz (The Benny Goodman Story, High Society). By the time I penned my first review for IMDb in 2003 I had seen, conservatively, some 5,000 films; and yet I've still only reviewed barely half that number. That's because of a self-imposed rule: I don't trust my memory so any and all films I say PRIOR to 2003 are off limits UNLESS they turn up on television, on DVD, or at a Revival House. Here's where perspective comes in: Whiplash is, no contest, the BEST film with Jazz as a background I have ever seen! Immediately, I sense, I am in trouble with some of you; you, in the second row, the lady with the green scarf. You are, I feel, itching to set me straight and cry "But Whiplash isn't about Jazz, it' s about Power, it's about Control, it's about Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter ... Stop right there, did I actually say that Whiplash was ABOUT Jazz? No, I did not. I was careful NOT to say so: What I said was 'the best film with jazz as a background'. And I'm happy to stand by that. What we have here are two exceptional acting performances, one merely brilliant and one - in the words of Duke Ellington - beyond excellence, praise, category, any and ev'rything (Okay, Duke, you didn't actually say that back in the day, but you WOULDDA if you'd see Mr. J.K. Simmons, you wouldda, believe me. See, what we have here is a young, sullen-looking Elvis lookalike locking horns with a Col Tom Parker mentor/controller and all we have to do is stand well back. Seems those naysayers were right after all, it's not about jazz.Great music, but the plot angers me This film tells the story of a young drummer who us accepted into the most prestigious music school in New York. The teacher there is very strict, even abusive physically and psychologically. The story then tells how the enmeshed relationship between the two evolve. The music in "Whiplash" is great. It's like going to a jazz concert, especially the finale performance at the end. For the plot itself, however, I did not like it at all. The teacher is very abusive, and dies everything he could to stir up rivalry and hatred among his students. The worst thing is that the film gives him time to justify his abuse. Abuse is not right, and the film allows abusers to give twisted reasons to justify something wrong. That really angers me. Coupled with the fact that his students keep on receiving the abuse, it evoked a lot of anger in me.The Suffering Artist Unconventional for a Film about Musicians, but Not Uncommon for a Sports or Military Movie, this is a Unique Take on the Disciplined Disciples of an American Art-Form.  Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons Play a Student and Teacher Relationship that is the Stuff of Legend but mostly Mythological Methods of Honing Raw Talent into Greatness.  The Film is Ripe with Overstated but Eloquent Dialog and Snazzy Musical Accompaniment (when things finally conclude). It is a Rather Rich Display of Impromptu Talent as the Student Drummer has His well Deserved Moment in the Spotlight and makes the most of it. The Film's Detractors are want to Point Out that it is a Dehumanizing Display of a Sadistic Fascist Overlord. But what makes the Film Work is its Off Toned Setting in the Elite Musical Education School that is on the Surface Less than Believable. But what does Surface is the Real Competitive World among Artists and the Sacrifices Needed to Excel.  The Movie Never displays Verisimilitude concerning the Methods of Cruel Behavior by the Instructor or wants them to be Authentic but more of a Surreal Statement on the Reality. It is Hyper-Fiction and its Disguise is Evident throughout and Not to be taken Literally. It's a Fresh Film Experience that is Thought-Provoking Inspiring Conversations and Debate. Overall, It's Better than just a "Good Job".Teller &amp; Simmons give Oscar-worthy performances in this blood, sweat and tears exercise into the passion of music WHIPLASH (2014) ***1/2 Miles Teller, JK Simmons, Paul Reiser, Melissa Benoist, Austin Stowell, Nate Lang, Chris Mulkey. Teller gives an amazing performance as a steadfast talented drummer who enrolled in a fiercely competitive music conservatory in New York City faces not only his inner will to be the best but his most unlikely mentor, his taskmaster instructor (Simmons at his career best), a sadistical no-nonsense fascist who drives fear as a wedge between achieving his goal as well as instilling a darker side he never knew existed. Written and directed by Damien Chazelle in a stunning debut spares no one from the at-times hard to watch brow-beating, haranguing and general unease put upon Teller by Simmons (all three deserve Oscar nods) proving that blood, sweat and tears into something you love (and crave) just may be your downward spiral nightmare instead of a dream fulfilled.J.K's Whipping Board! Whiplash (2014): Dir: Damien Chazelle / Cast: Miles Teller, J.K. Simmons, Paul Reiser, Melissa Benoist, Austin Stowell: Riveting and powerful drama about emotional turmoil. It stars Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman, a promising young drummer who is accepted at Shaffer Conservatory only to be confronted with the reality that his professor is a master manipulator. J.K. Simmons becomes the greatest factor in this film playing Terence Fletcher who conducts the band with ruthless strict discipline. This becomes a back and forth battle of wits as Neiman, frustrated and determined, drums until his hands bleed. Fletcher draws him in with promise and hopes before cutting lose with insults and profanities that draws tears from the students. Director Damien Chazelle presents a screenplay detailed with hard hitting music measured to extreme perfection by students aiming to succeed before their sanity caves. Teller draws off the anguish of somebody constantly hitting bottom despite playing the hardest. J.K. Simmons plays a talented yet sadistic conductor whose methods draw controversy. The climax battle of wills is a masterpiece of push and shove. In supporting roles is Paul Reiser as Neiman's supportive father who shares movie night with his son as well as find legal support when things really heat up. Melissa Benoist plays a girl who works at the theatre whom Neiman strikes up the nerve to ask out until his music becomes too important. There is also two other drummers who endure the heinous emotional torture issued by Fletcher. The road to fame can be a trying one that arrives at the cost of one's emotional endurance. Score: 10 / 10J.K Simmons enough said... Saw Whiplash in theaters in the beginning of January and i was blown away from the performances of Miles Teller and J.K Simmons both men gave 2 fantastic performances in their roles and they both steal the show. Also stars Paul Reiser (Aliens) and Melissa Benoist (Supergirl). Fletcher is the perfect bad teacher his one liners were awesome and he wouldn't stop until he reached Andrew into a point that he was going to say enough which you will actually see in the end this movie is insane and crazy but in a very good way i was surprised by the performances and the the film it self it definitely deserves your time. Final Rating: 10 out of 10.For me, it's a rape movie I understand what Chazelle wanted to show - that to achieve greatness, one has to devote a lot. But when I looked at Whiplash it was just story of abuse, Simmons character tries to break people - I'm really not sure is that a recipe for success(Well. I'm sure it's not). The happiest moment for me when Andrew took the stand and said that he should be a drummer (before the crash scene). It felt like rape victim standing up to oppressor. Whiplash is really an intense movie, but for me, first 60% of the film was just painful to watch.Surprisingly good I wasn't interested in watching this film at all when it went into the cinema, as it wasn't my sort of film. However, when It came on television, I thought it would be good as a 'background' film. I spent the next 1h 47m watching this film, not as a background movie, but it had my full interest.super! I watched this film one year ago. And the effect of viewing has surpassed all expectations! Thanks to this film, I began to take a different attitude to my hobby. I put some goals in front of me.This film makes you think about priorities.What is more important? Everyone decides for himself, of course. But why you spend more time on the Internet if you can achieve success and fulfill your dream, for example? Actors in this film, in my opinion, are chosen perfectly.The main character of this film acts unpredictably. This makes the film much more interesting. I advise you to watch this movie!Scaringly beautiful Everybody has something in his life which makes you want to push yourself to your limits. With Andrew (Miles Teller) , it's jazz music. He has an almost irrational drive to get better at being the best jazz drummer in history. When he gets the chance to come to the class of Terrence Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons), a well known teacher at the most prestigious music School in the USA, Andrew sees his future brighten up. Only he doesn't know the severity and seriousness with what Mr. Fletcher teaches his classes¬Ö Whiplash is a terrifyingly beautiful film about the things a person is capable of doing for greatness. Or as the Joker might say: "This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object." From the first scene of the movie we the perfect impression of what you're going to get throughout the movie, great jazz music and even greater performances by Miles Teller and especially by J.K Simmons. Every scene Simmons is in he draws all eyes to him, and he draws every breathe out of you, anxiously awaiting his reaction. In terms of villain factor, Simmons is right up there with Darth Vader, Voldemort etc. With the only difference that Simmons' character is much more realistic. The movie does a great job setting up the character of Andrew, making you understand where he is coming from and what drives him into the decisions he takes throughout the movie. The scenes with his dad are especially powerful. Apart from the dynamic performances by the two head roles, the other factor that elevates this movie is the beautiful soundtrack! Never has a soundtrack impacted me this much, from being a jazz enthusiast to an absolute jazz guru. Immediately after the movie I went to search for the soundtrack along with some extra jazz songs to make myself my own personal jazz playlist. The great thing about the soundtrack of Whiplash is it's necessity to the story: every track brings it's own factor to the movie. All in all, Whiplash succeeds in making a very fundamentantelly impactful film about success, desire and motivation, and the dangers it brings with it. It also succeeds at being the best movie of 2014.Tension is built through the entire film. In order to successfully give tension, there must be a conflict worth caring about. The conflict must be something of great importance to one of the characters in the film, and must be, in some way, relatable or understandable to the audience so that they care about it. In addition, it must also create an atmosphere that anything could go wrong at any moment. These two aspects of a film combined create tension. Throughout the entirety of Whiplash, you are in a constant state of tension. You feel everything that Miles Teller's character, Andrew, is going through; and you want him to succeed just as much as he wants to. Just when you think things couldn't get more intense, it throws something completely unexpected your way; and this happens with every single scene. This is the definition of wonderful writing. You feel that each character in the story cares, and it is brought to life by the wonderful performances by all of the cast members. And those performances wouldn't be possible if it weren't for some amazing directing. And that amazing directing wouldn't be possible if it weren't for the wonderful writing.  It was the type of writing that made my heart beat with every pound on the tension-building instrument: the drums. I recommend it greatly to all those who happened to stumble upon this film.A massive step in the right direction for American Films Constantly we hear about the lack of substance modern entertainment contains. This movie defies this generalization. Whiplash is excellently constructed, beautifully filmed, and the actors achieve a rarely reached level of skill, which collectively make it worthy of nine stars alone. However, it is Whiplash's display of the cost of greatness, it's insight into the nature of sacrifice and ambition, which make it a ten star film. J.K. Simmons role personifies the aspect of human ambition centered around seeking greatness at all costs, while Miles Teller shows the struggle of attempting to balance the losses. To anyone who wants to see a quality, well developed movie with an excellent, deep plot, watch Whiplash.Electrifying At first it was not the synopsis of the movie that captured my attention but the IMDb score. I thought "it's just a movie about drumming, how compelling can it be?". I was an ignorant fool. This movie rocks (or jazzes). From start to end. Your eyes are glued to the screen, you keep guessing what will happen next. I anticipated how the characters would react to one another, not how the story unfolds. The sheer brutality is both refreshing and terrifying. Coming from all characters. They did a splendid job on building original characters. I salute you. It was also an eye-opener for me and my friend. It was enthralling to learn more about the world of orchestras and jazz. Still, it was awesome. A thousand out of ten.Stars are born to be a star. They just need to fell and stand up. 'Whiplash' is the song which Andrew tries to play best. The name of the song actually is related to the subject of the movie. I can say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen about teacher &amp; student issues. Even though movie is focused on basically on music, this can be extended to any area. Teacher acts sardonic, derogatory which is contrary to the prevalent opinion of students must be supported. But what if you have a diamond to shine? You may have to do your hardest moves to sharpen it. That reminds me Deadpool's tests to make him Deadpool. Just watch it, I believe everyone will feel anger, sadness, envy, proud, happiness and more feelings together at the end of the movie. Not many movies can make you feel like this. Enjoy!Toe Tappingly Entertaining Whiplash, Whiplash, Whiplash. You make me ever so happy. It is mind boggling how good this movie is, not was. This was my personal favorite of the year and for good reason. Lets start with performances, J.K. Simmons is well the bright and shining star of this movie. I will have no arguments on that. He gives a Heath Ledger level performance and completely earned his Oscar. Miles Teller gave a perfect performance and was an inspirational lead in an inspirational movie. Next up is directing. Damien Chazelle's direction and writing is flawless to say the least. The smart overhead shots of instruments really show that the actors know how to play them. This movie is a must see for everyone who likes good music, great performances, and great directing. 100% or A+A blistering, intensely gratifying study on what it takes to succeed My head is still spinning from the whirlwind of what I just experienced. WHIPLASH isn't just a film. It has to be seen to be believed. The plot, although it probably won't do it justice, is about a young drummer (Miles Teller) who is accepted into a conservatory jazz band led by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Miles Teller's character wants to be one of the greats, and Fletcher uses what some would consider questionable methods to push him in that direction. That's really all you need to know going in. I should say that this is the absolute best I've seen out of Miles Teller, having graduated from teen fare like THE SPECTACULAR NOW. And J.K. Simmons? Wow! He brought such an intensity to his role that I wasn't prepared for. He's probably the best antagonist I've seen since R. Lee Ermey in FULL METAL JACKET, and pretty much as creative. However, it's not just the performances that make this such a compelling watch. This film has some of the best editing I've ever seen, and it fit so well with the jazz score. The various production elements were tightly woven and integrated in a way that pulls you into the story and never lets you go until the final frame. Unlike, say BIRDMAN, this completely lived up to the hype in my opinion. As a character study on what it takes to succeed, WHIPLASH is second to none. This feels like something that will be studied in years to come, and it's definitely worth your time.The best Oscar winning movie no one saw coming. What can I say, this film got a lot elements very right. It's musically dynamic and puts emphasis on how far people are willing to travel down the rabbit hole to achieve GREATNESS. It is a powerful process when one is inspiring greatness in another or having it pulled from within them by someone else. Especially when the driving force on both sides of this equation is rooted in a, "WHATEVER IT TAKES" mentality. And at the end of this process you are rewarded with something very, very special. This is the dualism of what "WHIPLASH" gives us. Fletcher's (J.K. Simmons) use of unconventional practices and gritty, unbridled approaches as an instructor with expectations of absolute perfection. Coupled with Andrew's (Miles Teller) fierce and unquenchable desire to produce said perfection at all costs, is very nicely displayed here. Both Simmons and Teller deliver the goods as we take this journey into what seems to be a very over the top aggression to performing exceptional jazz music. As a student, Andrew lives, eats, breaths and sleeps drumming to the point of self mutilation. His desire to be, "THE BEST" is superior to all else in his world. His only obstacle is the limitations in himself and the opposition his instructor, Fletcher, offers up in abundance. While Fletcher, the instructor/conductor is a perfectionist to the degree of being a narcissistic A-Hole. Deep down he wants the best out of the students who he deems worthy enough to be a part of his musical world. As the two entangle into this love hate relationship. Andrew begins a destructive evolution as a person and an aspiring musician. Taking blow after blow; with some self inflicted and others delved out by Fletcher himself. Andrew begins to detach from the world around him as he fights to become relevant in the eyes of his instructor. While Fletcher seems to want to break Andrew's will to achieve greatness to the point of involving others at his disposal to generate as many devices as possible to push his limits to the brink. Eventually the culmination of events crescendos to where both Andrew and Fletcher are brought back to reality. Each of them suffering a life altering aftermath to their destructive ways. They fatefully meet again some time after and all the blood, sweat, tears and tension laid out between them up to this point, lays the grounds for the MOTHER OF ALL BATTLES to ensue. Fletcher and Andrew collide in front of the world as they take the stage. Fletcher takes his shot to put Andrew on his knees for good only Andrew doesn't go down so easily. Hes cut form the same cloth as his instructor and the two reach deadlock. Their commonality is what wins in the end as we are subjected to the sweet spoils of their war. The ending result is a furious delivery of jaw dropping AWE. As the student becomes the master, we get exactly what they both have always wanted...absolute perfection.Amazing, amazing, amazing This review is completely and absolutely personal and I understand that many may not agree, but I was recommended this film by a close friend and thought it would definitely not be for me, but I was very impressed with the story line and how engaged in it I felt throughout the film. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and found myself being hooked. I absolutely loved the film and actors, and I love that there is a message being passed on here. As unlikable as the teacher is, I loved the perseverance of the student and the fact that he did not give up on his dream until he succeeded. I admire his passion and love for what he does and find this extremely inspiring. At times I completely forgot that this was just a fictional story and found myself suffering with him. Extremely impressed and will never not recommend.The hype is pretty much justified. Whiplash is a superbly acted adrenaline-shot. Being a film that won three Oscars and being ranked nr.36 on IMDb's top 250,this film had a lot to live up to and based on the trailer,I had no huge expectations in any way...but I was curious. And my curiosity was answered,met and extremely satisfied. This is not a film with many important characters,most of the support,like Paul Reisers odd but concerned dad exist only in the periphery....and that is completely okay,a film does not have to go all Magnolia and have half of Hollywood in it,sometimes all you need to make true sparks fly is an overlooked character actor and a newcomer,eager to prove himself. Miles Teller,of whom I've never heard,delivers a star-making performance. Truly impressive,showing an extreme range juggling Andrews insecurities,obsession,frustration,inner turmoil and rage. I expect great things from this young man. I have never held J.K Simmons in extremely high regard. I really dug him in OZ and as Jonah Jameson in the Spider-man series but otherwise,he often didn't really register,having a face that God seemed to have shaped to define the true expression of constant dead-pan sarcasm. Simmons completely sheds his usual on-screen persona here. Sure,his Fletcher is mean,a bully,a tormentor,a sadistic perfectionist....but he is given so much depth and complexity,handled by Simmons without missing a note,not one moment rings false. This man will sacrifice his own career just to find the next Charlie Parker;What first comes off as cruelty is a test of our young protagonists ambition. I might hate to admit it,as a big fan of Ruffalo's work in Foxcatcher and Norton's in Birdman but this veteran actor truly deserved his golden statue. This is a film about obsession,narcissism,competition,ambition and music. Both of the main characters have the same goal;For Andrew to achieve absolute greatness. The road to that possible goal is unfortunately for Andrew paved with abuse,torture and self-torture,all instigated by Fletchers harsh but effective coaching. One of them must take the role as antagonist for both to be able to reach their common goal,which might be easier said then done. This film,especially Andrews bleeding fingers,makes drumming seem more intense and endurance-demanding then Mixed Martial Arts,it sucks you in and refuses to let go. No,none of the two leads(Maybe Simmons should've been up for a lead Oscar)are especially likable,Fletchers vulgar persona is pretty quickly presented to us,while Andrew in a hilariously awkward scene breaks up with his girlfriend based on elaborate,selfish speculation on how she would react to him having drumming as his number-one-passion. They may not be that likable but they are very human and though not admitting it,they both know they're flawed individuals. The editing is amazing in this film. The frantic rhythm,the close,effective cuts in a rhythmic,musical tempo,especially during the films drumming-sessions,are hypnotic. Along with the flawless sound-mixing,that makes for three very well deserved Oscars. What a film!What an energy! What a masterpiece! I can not wait to see what the confident newcomer Damien Chazell brings us in the future. If this is not your tempo,then I don't know what is.This is how cinema needs to be! I'm out of words for this masterpiece. If you add also that this is a 3 millions budget movie, then i'm more than speechless! Big studios with your endless budget movies, just sit down and take notes! You don't need nothing more than an inspiring scenario, great acting and huge love for cinema to succeed! Exactly what Whiplash is. The story is engaging and inspiring, the direction is superb and the actors are over the edge with their acting! In my opinion, a "great movie" needs -except other things- to motivate you. To inspire you. To be better in your life, in your dreams, in anything has to do with your world. To think more spherical. To be better, in any form "better" can come. If you're not inspired when this movie finish, then, there's something wrong with you. - Academy, give them the Oscar already. This is all i have to say.What a load of..... This movie was a terrible, unrealistic, over the top ridiculous waste of time.  The only redeeming part was the great orchestral jazz, but the characters, story and, well everything really, means this movie should not be getting the positive reviews it has.  Where in the world would anyone be able to get away with treating students like this? It's utterly ridiculous cr** and I cannot believe this was even given approval be made in these days of human rights and anti bullying. What a disgrace.  In addition, we found the story so predictable - it was sort of like a REALLY bad Rocky but based on music, except Rocky had heart, soul and a relatable endearing underdog story. All the characters in this were totally unlikeable, unrelatable and awful, who cares what happens to any of them?  All in all this is an over-hyped horrible sad attempt at movie making and a great opportunity totally missed.
