Their motivations seem to be to do whatever might make a visually interesting scene. It\\'s largely contrived and predictable. The movie is a sequence of scenes we\\'ve seen before, but executed without panache and little logic. It\\'s part teenage fantasy fulfillment for middle-aged gun nuts, part DTV low-budget actioner, part morality play with the subtlety of an Aesop fable. The actors do as well as they can with the material provided, but the script seems something that even Steven Segal would reject for one of his recent Eastern European productions. Production values aren\\'t too terribly bad, but suffer from over-reliance on jiggly-cam shots. With some fifty-thousand screenplays written each year and a huge catalogue of scripts that haven\\'t been produced, one would think they could have found better material.'], [5, \"It's a-ohkay.\", 'This movie isn\\'t particularly good, but it\\'s okay for a single watch. But the movie is fairly fast paced, it\\'s basically only an hour and 20 minutes.\\nSure, the plot has holes and the logic is really quite silly at certain points during the movie. Had those not been there, I would have rated it 6, no problem. But there were action, and it was fast paced, so atleast not to get boring. The plot itself was very predictable, but I never expected much else. The quality of the cinematography and the action however... not all that great, but for me it worked alright, atleast enough for me to watch the whole movie.\\nFor me, the movie were actually decent enough, for the most part. It was mainly towards the ending that I had the hardest time with it. The acting felt solid enough, but the druglord, played by Epps were clearly the worst to me. The 3 brothers Hause, Ashmore and Holmes did a decent job, so did Willis, when he were on screen, which he barely were. Also \"hecnhman\" no. 1, played by Brosnan also did a good job.<br/><br/>\\nBiggest gripes I had with the movie:<br/><br/>1: A few big ones for me, were that supposedly two of the brothers are well trained marines. Yet they don\\'t foresee that their identity might be compromised as they go full rambo on a druglord. Just casually leaving the wife at home as if it were any regular day. She should have been sent to some remote cabin, paid in cash. <br/><br/>2: Also why would you assault the druglords major operation headquarter, without much in sense of tactical entry and tactics. They just walse right in, and with a policeshield for only cover. They hit the druglord, rescue the hostages and leave. Never even checking to make sure he is down for the count and no double-tap. You could see the revenge hit, he would soon make on them, coming from a mile off.<br/><br/>3: And why would you (a), use you own truck, without atleast hiding its numberplate and (b), why would you return to your everyday address between skirmishes and also plan meetings there.<br/><br/>4: And during the last fight at the house, as the one brother gets shot. The 3rd brother (untrained), but still. He just rushes out infront of a weapon he clearly know is there, because he just saw his brother get shot. He however, decides to turn his back to the gun, so he can cry over his brothers dead body. And for some reason the \"badguy\" with the weapon, should have killed the 3rd brother long ago, but figures he wants to do it excecution-style, which is tempting, I guess. Now that he is kneeling down, facing away... but still.'], [-1, 'Atrocious is an understatement', \"Usually I'll watch any action movie happily. Especially one starting Bruce Willis as a main character. This film however is drop dead awful. Unwatchable. From the gimmicky and unprofessional editing to the delay in the bullets hitting their mark. <br/><br/>Unrealistic chases and fight scenes where they cut costs by using cameras at various angles to mask the actual fighting. I could only watch 7 or 8 minutes of this torture before I had to stop. Probably the cringiest I have ever felt when watching a movie. So terribly terribly bad. <br/><br/>I usually watch any more regardless of what IMDB rating it got if it has an actor or two that I like. This film however would receive an absolute zero from me. Instead of checking this movie out in the cinem rewatch a classic. Trust me. You'll thank me later. <br/><br/>P.S This is my first time writing a review. I created an account with the sole purpose of writing this scathing and honest review.\"], [1, \"You don't want to know what you're not missing!\", \"I felt so strongly about this piece of garbage that I specifically created an account to review it and hopefully save someone else from wasting their time.\\nNo matter how bored you are, you will feel worse after having watched this trash movie. The actors do an ok job, it's what you'd expect for a B-movie and the action scenes are cheap but watchable. However, the story totally ruined it for me. So much so that I could not even bring myself to watch it to the end even though I'm a sucker for pretty much anything that involves shootouts, military men or Bruce Willis...\\nPlease, move on with your life. Reading this review is already too much time you wasted on this movie.\"], [7, 'This film was mishandled from an advertising standpoint.', \"Acts of Violence (2018)\\nThis is an action film about a woman kidnapped by human traffickers. Her fiance and his ex-military brothers set out to track her down and save her before it is too late. It stars Bruce Willis, Mike Epps, Cole Hauser, Shawn Ashmore, Sophia Bush and Melissa Bolona. It has received generally unfavorable reviews and hasn't done well at the box office. This film was mishandled from an advertising standpoint. Sure, Bruce Willis is a selling point, but unless he's the main star, he shouldn't be advertised as such. The film itself is pretty good. It's a common theme recently popularized by the Taken series. Someone has been kidnapped or killed and our hero/anti-heroes come to the rescue and/or seek revenge. Throw in a cop who's trying to do things through legal means, and you have a film. It can be executed well, i.e. the aforementioned Taken. It can also be managed poorly, there are too many of these to list. This film falls in the middle.\"], [7, 'Nothing new but still ok', \"This is one of those movies you watch when there's nothing else to see. It's been (over)done many times before. The acting was better than expected, even for Bruce Willis who's been questionable in his past roles. The directing was the major issue here. This film lacked direction to the actors - it felt as if they were on their own in some scenes and in others the dialogue and action could have been better portrayed. Part of that was also the camera operator direction, again the directors job. The writing also had some plot issues and the editing could have been tighter. Never mind the lousy score throughout the film. 6.5/10 rounded up to a 7 for B-list actors doing a better than expected job.\"], [3, 'Total Dross', 'This is just a Bad film,although Bruce Willis was in it for about 5 minutes,he seems to be accepting any roles he is offered,i watched hoping it would get better but its was just Flat'], [2, \"Just couldn't finish it\", \"Annoying cheesy two dimensional characters. Very, and I mean very predictable story line. Politically correct agenda. What's not to love? This one I couldn't even finish. What the hell is Bruce Willis' agent taking these days? Willis has gone from Big screen draw to straight to TV (if he's lucky). There is absolutely nothing to see here folks so best just to move along please.\"], [6, 'Enjoyable B grade action/thriller', \"Wow after reading some of the bad reviews, I almost didn't watch it. I love the way people go out of the way to watch a movie that they know is a B grade action movie and then come on imdb and write a review that discredits everything you SHOULD expect in a B grade action movie. So let me write a list of things that you should expect in a B grade action movie and check those off first: Amateur script- check, Amateur story - check, Amateur acting - check, but above expected, Amateur camera work - check, but again better than usual, Plot Holes - Check.\\nI like B grade action movies and when compared to the rest (and I've seen a LOT), I'd give this a solid 6.5 as it kept me interested and entertained for the majority of the 86 minute run-time and that's all that really needs to be said.\"], [10, 'It Is What It Is', \"So, this obviously isn't the best movie out there, but it's defiantly not that bad. Some of these reviews are ripping this film apart, but for it only being filmed in 15 days on a low budget, it is what it is. The action is pretty entertaining, the acting is believable, the editing is sub-part, unfortunately the script is the weakest part. It's a little simple, cheesy and overdone. I would watch if you are bored, want something simple, and are a sophia bush/bruce willis fan.\"], [-1, 'Worth a watch if you are bored.', \"Bruce does well in his brief appearances.

This whole premise is a joke, the military brothers were made into a joke and the police were made into a joke. It didn't have to be this bad. How did nobody care enough to ignore common sense and put this out? This crap is unacceptable. You need a quality assurance person on these films. It was worse than montazumas revenge.\"], [8, 'Movie Grade B', 'I thought the movie was pretty good. It was not the best movie but it was a decent movie with a storyline. It had some familiar faces and names. The storyline was good. The movie was not slow or confusing either.'], [5, 'If this was a mini series, it would have been great.', 'The first five minuites of this movie was great. The bond of the brothers protecting each other as children was great, and the VA scene was absolutely perfect. I have had the same experience with the VA. Unfortunately, after that, the story became fragmented. Honestly, it was a good story but the editing board must have had a hay day. It just jumped from scene to scene without many things being accounted for. The actors were not allowed to show their full range of emotions. If it was an 8 part mini series, it would have been great. The characters needed time to be explored more. If it had been longer, the action scenes could have been more developed. I like all the actors, and they probably did more in scenes that were left on the cutting room floor.'], [10, 'A great one time watch that any guy with testosterone will enjoy. But not PC enough for critics', 'The movie is good. I had a great time at the theater. My brothers loved it. People have come up with some really,really weird reasons to dislike the film. Like \"It takes a serious issue of sex trafficking, and puts it into an action film\" Hello? EVERY SINGLE CRITIC LIKED TAKEN. Which did the exact same thing, but even more so. This film is harder hitting then Taken. And the bad guys are really interesting, and the victim is far more worthy of respect. The bad guy is brilliantly portrayed, but I don\\'t think the critics liked someone of his ethnicity portraying a bad guy, especially a pimp. I loved him. Really, this is a good time to not listen to critics, this is not the kind of film they will ever like.'], [7, 'a good movie', 'This is one of them movies where you know whats going to happen fro the start. and scenes the dialogue and action could have been better portrayed.but it a good watch'], [-1, 'Barely makes it to 1 star', 'This wasn\\'t the sort of film I\\'d usually watch, as the synopsis and d list cast point to \"made for TV potboiler\"...The only reason I gave it houseroom was because I thought that even Bruce Willis (who let\\'s be fair has made his share of turkeys) would never have sunk so low as ro have made such a ridiculous exploitative clunker as this......Turns out I was wrong......Bruce has obviously got to that stage in his career where he no longer cares about the quality of the film\\'s he makes, but is just walking from his trailer to the set and doing a calculation in his head as to how much he\\'s being paid per hour.......Hopefully this may have funded some new guttering for his pool house.....looking at the production values I\\'m guessing that 95% of the budget went to Bruce and the remainder went on the remaining cast and ropey pyrotechnics.......The one plus of this movie is that it is only 86 minutes long (about 83 minutes too long) but at least (assuming you make it to the end) you won\\'t feel too cheated, but overall a complete avoidance is even better.......5* Turkey'], [10, 'Human Trafficking in Cleveland, Ohio', \"While some movie critics and film buffs would be giving this unsatisfactory reviews, I on the other hand have been entertained and educated. <br/><br/>First of all, I'm entertained enough to see Bruce Willis as a supporting cast and working along side Cole Hauser again (remembering their work in Tears of the Sun of 2003). Bruce plays as a tired old cop who's fed up with the frequent human trafficking case which doesn't seem to have an end to it. Cole on the other hand is an ex-military with PTSD who helps find his younger brother's fiancé no matter what it takes. So if you're looking for action, this movie has enough gun fight scenes to satisfy that expectation. <br/><br/>Finally, for someone like me who has little awareness about human trafficking in the US, this movie helped me realize that it's real and what makes it a big problem is because of the different forces at play supporting such dreadful heinous activities. Aside from human trafficking, family is also one of the focus of the movie. But if creating awareness about human trafficking is the main theme, whether it's in Ohio or anywhere else in the world , I like the approach and how the story was written.\"], [7, 'For anybody who decided to only read all the bad reviews....', \"I never review movies here. All I want to say about this movie is that I was suspicious of this movie from the start. I was almost certain I was going to be turning this off after 5 or 10 minutes. But an hour in and I'm still watching it. I actually paused it to look something up about the movie, and happen to catch some of the reviews.<br/><br/>So I read in a few of them that this movie is basically a revenge fantasy for gun nuts(That's an actual quote(paraphrased) from one of the reviews). Well this isn't a spoiler, and I'm only saying it becuase it's only spoken for a second and then forgotten, but the 2 older brothers are rangers. That's all I have to say. The rest of the movie is exactly what would happen if 2 rangers had their sister kidnapped, and they knew where she was.\"], [1, 'Bruce Willis Phones in Another Bomb', \"Why doesn't Bruce Willis just walk into any coffee shop in Hollywood and buy someone's screenplay sight unseen? He'd come up with a better project than the ones he's making these days. To say that this movie has a story is like saying a cat running across a piano keyboard is music.<br/><br/>Wow, this is seriously one of the worst movies ever made. Human traffickers just go around plucking women off the street? It's ironic because the hero is at a strip club where real human trafficking takes place. So the good guys are basically supporting human trafficking while the dude's fiancée is getting human trafficked. <br/><br/>How about this? In these terrible movies let's just do away with any pretense of a story and just get right to the fighting and killing. It's such a ridiculously stupid story that I'd be shocked to learn that the script took more than one day to write.<br/><br/>And, of course, the villain is a Black guy who speaks with a just-for-the-movies jive accent.\"], [6, 'The Expendables with good actors', \"This movie is essentially The Expendables but tastefully tuned down:\\n<ul><li>Not as hokey, fewer big names, and fewer unnecessarily large explosions</li></ul><br/><br/>The casting was decently balanced with a mix of B/B+ actors, most being recognizable but not necessarily known for only playing quintessential badass roles. <br/><br/>Once you're branded a badass actor (albeit not necessarily untalented), it's hard to break that mold in Hollywood, even if the actor is multifaceted. Willis is a great example if you look at some of his earlier work (Sixth Sense). <br/><br/>That being said, you know what to expect of modern-day badass Willis. As far as the supporting cast, it was appreciated to see some of the lesser-known unconventional actors 'earn' badass status in this movie. <br/><br/>I hope Hollywood realizes that you don't need to cast a well-built actor to play a badass role (unless body-type is pivotal to the plot).. But hell, look at Bryan Cranston in Breaking Bad!<br/><br/>The verdict: Great action, decent acting/casting, contrived plot.<br/><br/>5.5/10\"], [5, 'Not Too Bad For A Bad Film', 'Bruce Willis in another average film, but the real reason why the critics seem so hateful is that the heroes are mainly white males (big no no for the SJW crowd, which is most of the media) and the crowning tu#d in the waterpipe, heaven forbid, the bad guys are actually bad, and lead by a black guy.

I have been a devoted fan of Bruce Willis since Diehard but this is AWFUL and BORING and PREDICTABLE. <br/><br/>Damn.'], [4, 'VIEWS ON FILM review of Acts of Violence', 'Acts of Violence is my latest review. Its story involves three ex-military bros attempting to rescue one of their fiancees from being kidnapped and/or embroiled in a human trafficking ring. \"Violence\" takes a small cue from the film Four Brothers while giving star Bruce Willis a cliched, cop character name (Detective James Avery). Oh and its movie title may have resulted from execs throwing their hands up and surrendering their creative sheen during production meetings. <br/><br/>Now \"Violence\" at eighty-six relentless minutes, really earns its label. This is a brutal, sickening, and wrongful, bullet-laden flick that may make you avoid its urban setting for years to come (in case you are wondering, I\\'m unhappily talking about Cleveland, OH).<br/><br/>In truth and utmost confidence, I can\\'t recommend Acts of Violence unless I was forced to at gunpoint (no pun intended). Director Brett Donowho lacks a sense of humanity, a sense of tact, and a sense of being morally inhibited. With \"Violence\", you get slipshod editing, forceful standoffs masquerading as logic, and actors Willis and Mike Epps unknowingly damaging their reputations in the process (Bruce has been doing this for years so it may not matter). <br/><br/>Acts of Violence also has plenty of action sequences while not taking its time to tell a deepening story. Everything is bogged down as the pic is drenched in blood, guts, and \"above the law\" positions. Donowho really needs to check himself for he fails to commercialize bad cop corruption and revenge platitude the way David Ayer did in 2008\\'s Street Kings. <br/><br/>In retrospect, \"Violence\" was narrowly released in theaters and for good reason. It has a wink wink lack of empathy and miscues pertaining to the unsystematic plot threads possessed. No audience member would subject to how unnecessary and how uncouth The Act of Violence\\'s torturous, mind sadism is. Rating: 1 and a half stars.'], [1, 'Signed up to IMDB for this', \"There are no words. From the first scene, to the last, it hurt. Its not possible to have gotten a film THIS bad. I mean truly. They had to try, physically try, to do this.\\nHollywood is dead. They have nothing left, nothing. They need to apologise. As if they didn't before. But there are no words. All associated with this film must be deeply ashamed and embarrassed. Someone must have picture of Bruce. \\nI don't even know what the 1 was for.\\nAll grades over 4 star are employees of the film or studio\"], [4, 'A cliché of various revenge movies', 'It\\'s really a pity this movie was so weak because there are some pretty good actors with an awful script. This was a cliché of various revenge/vigilante movies. The dialogues are wooden and the acting is stiff and don\\'t get me started on the script. The antagonists are set out to be as \"evil\" as possible who are involved in everything from drug trafficking to sexual slavery (just to make them really bad). It is, however, a bit difficult to take this movie seriously when the writers try to expose the horrors of human trafficking while there is a scene where the \"groom to be\" gets lap dance but not one but three women and all paid for by the brother of the girl kidnapped.'], [3, 'Cole Hauser performed well', \"Nice shoot 'm up, blow 'm up. Predictable. <br/><br/>Why do you have a main player (kidnapped women) whose face is completely numbed out with botox. She looks awful and can barely carry-on dialogue without sounding muffled. Ridiculous.\"], [4, \"It's taken but without a certain set of skills\", \"Some slight differences with how things happen and who's involved but essentially boils down to the same premise.<br/><br/>Just a poor imitation in just about every way.<br/><br/>characters are mostly the usual tropes/cliches, some of them are bit more sick/twisted than from taken.\"], [1, \"It's a January Film..\", \"When his fiancee is kidnapped by human traffickers, Roman (Ashton Holmes) and his ex-military brothers set out to track her down and save her before it is too late. Along the way, Roman teams up with Avery (Bruce Willis), a cop investigating human trafficking and fighting the corrupted bureaucracy that has harmful intentions. Acts of Violence is a straight to dvd garbage fire starring Bruce Willis stunt double and some other actors that their careers have fallen short. Speaking of stunt doubles Willis was so bored to film and act to this project that he couldn't even throw a punch and i'm talking about a scene where he goes against a thug and then delivers a cheesy 90's one liner. The film also tries to get dramatic at times but the boring plot, characters, wooden acting and all the rest like the bland directing, bad script and all of those stuff make for a terrible movie but let's hope so that Willis will redeem himself with the Death Wish remake which looks alright and better than this at least. (0/10)\"], [2, \"What are guns good for? Killing! Bullets don't discriminate.\", \"The synopsis says it all. The story is pretty simple. Unfortunately, this movie does little to speak to the problem of human trafficking. What it does do is glorify the gun and excessive force in civilian territory. There is always someone with a bigger gun, someone more ruthless. These good guys managed to show their brawn and get two family members killed in the process. It wasn't heroic, it wasn't necessary. It was stupid. If you tease a snake you're going to get bitten, especially if you don't kill it first. Americans are so tied to their right of self-defence and right to own a gun, they've forgotten what it is to be civil. This movie taught me how to draw a hand gun, how to shoot first and ask questions later and how to get my family killed in the process. There was no finesse, no awareness of the bigger game, no strategy. Liam Neeson has done it so much better and Charles Bronson before him.\"], [3, 'Bruce Willis, Breasts, Bad guys, Blatantly horrible acting', \"I can only assume Bruce Willis lost a bet and HAD to partake in this failure of of cinematic proportions...

But that reality shoots holes in the \"prison reform\" movement which is just about flooding our cities and towns with drug dealers.. If you like the Narcos series you will like this movie. <br/><br/>A lot of what the movie depicts, including white slavery, has already invaded our cities and has become normal in Mexican border towns now ruled by the cartels and their corrupt politicians.

She should consider a career change. But not porn. She\\'s not hot enough or a good enough actress for porn. And Bruce Willis\\' acting reminded me of Steven Segal: slow and sluggish. Zero energy.

One thumb up.'], [2, 'Terrible direction!!', 'Acts of Violence (1 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Acts of Violence is everything you can expect for a straight to dvd action film. Terrible dialogue, bad direction, forgettable action, and choppy editing. It seemed like a promising premise from the looks of the trailer which almost had a feel like the first Taken movie. <br/><br/>The plot follows three brothers Deklan (Cole Hauser), Brandon (Shawn Ashmore), and Roman (Ashton Holmes) who is engaged to a childhood sweetheart Mia (Melissa Bolona). When Mia was on her bachelorette party and gets abducted by a couple of guys who work for Max (Mike Epps). Were they are sex trafficking girls. That has been an ongoing case for Detective James (Bruce Willis) who can never capture Max. Meanwhile, the three brothers are going on a manhunt to kill whoever is involved in this sex trafficking and to bring Mia home. <br/><br/>The pros about this film? Cole Hauser somewhat gave a decent performance playing a veteran who is still suffering from his tours and writes memoirs of his war experience. He is blunt with the truth especially with family and his future sister in law. But the character does display is struggling conflict with emotions.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the cons of this film? The script was terrible. The beginning scene with Bruce Willis and his law enforcement getting ready for a raid. There conversations seemed to be unprofessional nor did it seem believable. Also, there was no character development which could have helped with the three brothers doing whatever it takes to get Mia back even if it requires them breaking the law. <br/><br/>The direction was horrible. People make stupid decisions. Even good guys. They stand right out in the open when they know they are about to be invaded with the bad guys. Also, when the brothers are going on a vigilante hunt, they never thought of the consequences if the bad guys will track them down back to there personal homes? Guessing not. <br/><br/>The action and shoot out scenes are horrible. Director did a terrible job with scene blocking. Cause the shoot outs and characters movement seemed to have a late reaction. I also think the editing was poor and choppy which did not help. <br/><br/>Overall, Acts of Violence is a terrible film. Acting was dull. Direction and script was bad. The action scenes are nothing worth mentioning. And editing was just terrible. <br/><br/>I would not recommend this film.'], [7, \"You like shoot em ups? Don't need too much of that sappy stuff?\", \"This was an above average action film. The plot is typical for a big shooter. Baddies are many and the heros do die. The gun play isn't too over the top.

My biggest concern is at the pace of which everything happens. They turned a movie that should of had at least couple week timeline into what seemed like 2 days. I believe that the hour and a half movie should of been at least two hours. There are so many holes in this movie because it's just sped through.<br/><br/>My other complaint is (as mentioned in a previous review) is when one of the brothers gets shot, another brother comes out of the room he is in and turns his back towards the direction that he knows the shooter is coming from. Makes no sense. Trained or not. <br/><br/>I did enjoy the acting overall and to me it really saved the movie.\"]]\n"
