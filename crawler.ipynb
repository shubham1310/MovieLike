      "Yet another Jar Jar Abrams abortion When I saw what the idiot Abrams did to Star Trek, I was furious. When I learned that he was going to direct the latest Star Wars movie, I knew exactly what would be the result; a total abortion of a great franchise, just as he did Star Trek. Abrams once again shows his true colors by exploiting the work of someone else, and then totally destroying it. Abrams philosophy is \"All we have to do is take the original movie, change a few character names, and then put it up as a new GREAT IDEA.\" Sorry, it doesn't work this time.  In a horrible rip off of the first Star Wars movie that premiered in 1977, Abrams takes EVERY plot idea, relies on Disney marketing to hype the movie to death, and then delivers a total failure of a movie complete with horrible actors (Harrison Ford is the exception) and trying to rely on effects to say, \"Hey, look what I can do!\" A few highlights: CAUTION: MAJOR SPOILER ALERT, however Abrams spoiled the movie before I wrote this review. During a storm trooper invasion a map was hidden in R2 Rolie Polie and pursued by the bad guys. During a storm trooper invasion, plans were hidden in R2-D2 and pursued by the bad guys. Vader Junior holds a guy up by the throat wanting to know what happened to the map. Vader holds up a rebel by the throat wanting to know what happened to the plans Luke Blackwalker climbed in the lower areas of the Falcon to use the guns and fight the bad guys. Luke Skywalker climbed in the lower areas of the Falcon to use the guns and fight the bad guys Han Solo, an older and wiser man was killed by Vader Junior with a light saber. Ben Kenobe, and older and wiser man was killed by Vader with a light saber. A girl realizes she has Jedi powers and goes off to find how they work. Luke realizes he has Jedi powers and goes off to find out how they work. Solo leads a rebel team to infiltrate a planet to kill its defenses (stolen from Return of the Jedi). Solo leads a rebel team to infiltrate a planet and kill the defense screen.  A new weapon is tested out and shown its force by destroying a planet far from it. A new Death Star is tested out and shown its force by destroying a planet called Alderon. A meeting happens in a room with a round map showing the weakness of the planet weapon. A meeting happens in a room with a round map showing the weakness of the death star. A group of rebel forces flies down a trench in order to shoot at the planet weapon's weakness and destroy it. A group of rebel forces flies down a trench in order to shoot at the death star's weakness and destroy it. R2-D2 and 3PO had NO meaning in the movie at all. Their appearances were only there to be able to say that they've been in all Star Wars movies Luke Skywalker finally shows up at the end of the movie, which was the obsession of the stupid plot, only to say NOTHING, but stare at the girl attempting to hand him his light saber. The movie ended before we heard the phrase, \"I am your father.\" I would have vomited all over the theater floor if this had come about. Why people hire, support or even give J.J. Abrams any kind of recognition is beyond me. He's a horrible director and total thief of classic work. This time however, he can't blame his stupidity on an \"alternate time line\" as he tried miserably in Star Trek.\n",
      "Disney's Hype Wars Won. Star Wars Did Not - A Safe Corporate Exercise In Entertainment. Following the mass-marketing campaign extraordinaire, I truly was fooled into believing this was a fantastic movie before I saw it. I believed the hype, that this was a Star Wars returned to form.....It is not!  Story-wise it falls short of the prequels, never mind the original films. It truly is a Disney Star Wars. It's an almost sickeningly safe corporate exercise in entertainment with none of the original edge &amp; flare/excitement. The original was based on old Saturday morning swash-buckling matinée series, with heroes &amp; beautiful heroines. This Star Wars gave us a flat-chested car mechanic who looks like a teenage choirboy, a ham-acting ex-storm-trooper &amp; Princess Leia re-imagined as a General. It's just soulless &amp; flat &amp; scared of its own shadow!  Basically they've taken the original story, sucked all the sexiness out of it &amp; punched &amp; squeezed it into a corporate 'Disney' box. All stories must have accessibility, they must allow you to buy into the imaginings &amp; in this 'The Force Awakens' fails miserably as it has hacked clumsily away at the origin story to suit its new safe Disney Star Wars universe. Booo!\n",
      "JJ Abrams needs to quit Just awful is all I can say. A sanitation storm trooper,, who was at a invasion? A sanitation storm trooper who knows how to sword fight? Just clueless. I did not like this at all, my children did not like this, my grandma did not like this, Time lines seem to not fit, we got a old princess lea, but the technology hasn't been improved, or the old craft has not been upgraded to new technology. The found the falcon on a junk planet, but yet it's fully operational after 40 years, do they have eternal power sources, i don't think so. The end of the show was even more worthless, Luke was on what appears to be earth? and on a island in the middle of the ocean with no food or water or shelter. lololmao. Things must be getting pretty desperate in Lollywood for them to be pumping out this garbage.\n",
      "Didn't expect much, was still disappointed. This movie was exactly what I expected it to be. A safe, unimaginative, nostalgia-filled cash grab. I cant exactly blame Disney or Abrams for taking the safe route after the backlash Lucas got for attempting to do something new, but I was still surprised at exactly how safe they decided to stay. Nearly everything is a rehash of episode 4. Same plot, same characters, same factions, even another death star. There is a painful lack of exposition. Nothing is explained about the state of the galaxy or what happened after episode 6. The viewer is not told what the New Republic is, not told what the First Order is, what the motivations of either party are, who Rey is or why she so good at everything. I know this is the first in a new trilogy, but that doesn't excuse bad writing in this movie. There is zero world building. Even the musical score is lackluster, something I figured for impossible in a Star Wars movie. For all the hate he gets, Lucas was a master world builder. I genuinely enjoyed the machinations of Palpatine within the Senate, the political scheming of the trade federation, and the build up to the start of the Clone Wars. It made the Star Wars universe seem so real seeing a functioning government and the power struggles within it. Abrams' entry in the series is devoid of all of that context. And the lesser for it. I was seriously surprised at the lack of criticism the is movie received in the days and weeks after its release. Star Wars fans ripped into every. single. little. flaw. in the prequels, yet this movie was getting a pass on major deficiencies. I even went out to see it two more times just to make sure I wasn't missing any hidden dialogue or bits of exposition. Nope.  Even now, nearly a year after its release, its still being called the best Star Wars movie by many people. I don't understand it. Star Wars is supposed to be a fantasy series, and maybe I'm wrong, but world building and exposition are supposed to be important parts of fantasy writing. How the movie with arguably the least exposition and world building is being hailed as the best is beyond me. Bottom line: This a decent action movie, but a sub par Star Wars movie.\n",
      "Disney Sponsored Fan Fiction. The Force Awakens Is A Disgraceful Example Of Corporate Filmmaking. For those praising this film,  Star Wars Episode 7 is a despicable corporate product of a movie, that leeches off the imagination of the man who created its universe, while simultaneously giving him a giant middle finger by erasing all remnants of his Prequel Trilogy and turning the franchise into a vehicle for pandering fan service and a \"progressive\", feminist agenda.  Episode 7 is nothing but glorified fan fiction made by a corporation desperate to get a return on their investment. With years of careful risk-benefit analysis, they were able to produce a film that upset the least amount of the rabid, vicious \"original fan base\" as possible. So \"fans\", you got everything you wanted. George Lucas, and the prequels are but a memory and you get all your original toys back, with just enough new crap to fool you into thinking your experiencing something fresh. You'll see the next 20 Star Wars movies and you'll get everything you begged to have, but you'll never be surprised.  When Lucas wrote the script for A New Hope, he wasn't trying to please anyone but himself. He wasn't feeding a hungry mob everything they wanted, he was crafting a story that he wanted to see told on film. After 6 great chapters, he finished his story. So enjoy Disney's Star Wars movies until the end of time, but just remember that you're never going to see a film series so daring, ambitious, and above all, entertaining as George Lucas' Star Wars.  Now, onto the aspects of this travesty that I fundamentally stand against. 1. A Star Wars Movie Without George Lucas Is Not Star Wars  George Lucas didn't just have a part in the making of Star Wars, he CREATED it. Star Wars wasn't a collaboration that incorporated the imaginations of many different people. It wasn't an adaptation of someone else's work. Star Wars is solely the product of one man's imagination. Sure, tons of people worked on the films, but the entire Star Wars universe is George Lucas' vision. The uniqueness of Star Wars is that it all comes from the mind of one, incredibly creative man. Episodes 1-6 are the official Star Wars story as told by the man who created it. Any other story is, by definition, an imitation. Lucasfilm can try all they like to make these new movies look and feel like the real deal, but the truth of the matter is, they will never be the genuine article. Lucas' quirky touch is what makes Star Wars special. Without it, it's just another disposable sci-fi franchise.  2. Every Decision Was Made By A Corporation.   The Force Awakens is a focus-grouped, market researched, PRODUCT that reeks of corporate control. After acquiring Lucasfilm, Disney had this film made so they would make their money back and then some. Storytelling was absolutely secondary. And the conception of the film isn't the only glaringly obvious corporate decision in Episode 7. EVERY major decision in the film was overseen by Disney and Lucasfilm. The new characters in particular reek of corporate greed and agenda pushing. The main character is a female and the secondary characters are mostly played by women or minorities. Disney will champion these casting decisions as a progressive triumph, but the truth of the matter is that these new characters exist purely as a PR move. Congratulations, your SJW street cred is through the roof, but I will never support a movie that uses someone else's creation as a platform to help their brand.   3. It Panders To A Vocal Minority Of \"Fans\" It absolutely sickens me that this movie deliberately ignores and actively mocks the prequels. George Lucas spent 10 years of his life crafting those films, and millions of people loved them, but the executives at Lucasfilm and Disney were so afraid of the pathetic internet trolls that they became one themselves. All the marketing of \"The movie you've been waiting for since 1983!\", \"It's all real!\", \"The magic is back!\"... it's all a ploy to appease a vocal minority of sad losers that couldn't stand that Episodes 1,2, and 3 tried new things. Even the title of the movie is a shot at the prequels. \"The Force Awakens\", as if those 3 massively popular movies somehow put the force to sleep. Once again, all of these decisions are corporate based. As a result, we get a two hour apology tour. They hear people complain about dialogue, so everyone becomes an over-acting spunk machine. They hear people complain about politics, so they ax that aspect entirely. Basically, they hear people complain about the prequels, so they do everything possible to remove them from memory. \"We hate George Lucas and the prequels too, see?\" Because the vocal minority of whiners is more important than the majority of people who love Lucas' entire saga. It's almost shocking how disrespectful Lucasfilm has been to prequel fans and Lucas himself. Almost.  4. This Is A Troubling Sign Of Things To Come.   The Force Awakens ushers in an era of prostitution for the Star Wars name. With Episode 7, Disney has learned that they can make whatever they want, and as long they do exactly what the \"fans\" tell them, they'll have a cash cow that never dries up, and they'll never have anyone complain. After all, fans are getting everything they want, right? Well what about those of us that want to see NEW things? These corporations don't care about us. New ideas could upset people, so innovation loses over imitation. The Star Wars story ended in 2005. It's time for something new. Boycott the rest of Disney's Star Wars fan-fiction, and maybe we can prevent Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens from being the movie that killed the blockbuster. \n",
      "Star Wars The Force Awoken Review I have just watched the film after weeks or being too nervous .  After the 30 minutes of franchise related adverts ,the trailers started .A constant flow of good vs evil franchise films starting with London has Fallen ,Captain America ,Civil War, Star Trek ,X- men .  Seriously this constant flow of formulaic drivel has become laughable .Time to try something different perhaps .  The new characters in the film all seemed very light weight ,there was no real character development at all for Finn . I didn't appreciate the way that every significant character seemed to just bump into each other regardless of where they landed .  The discovery of the LightSabre was also a very questionable scene .  Another criticism was the situation between Leia ,Han and their son now choosing to work for the evil Empire . They seemed to accept the situation a little too easily for my liking .  The acting of Domhnall Gleeson was pantomime camp .  The scene where Rey discovers her powers and then uses then was atrocious .  The scene showing the death of Han was over thought and you could see the outcome from a mile off .  The obsession with Death Star Super weapons was boring and the usual split action scene of space battle / significant character battle really has become an over used cliché .  I never enjoyed one scene in the whole film .  I am truly broken hearted ,and what the hell was that final scene of Rey holding a light sabre and Luke facing her .It was nothing more than a scene devised for an 80s style flyover scene reminiscent of Clash of the Titans (original).  My rating 2/10\n",
      "A Cinematic Travesty I will never forget seeing Star Wars Episode IV for the first time in 1977. What an awesome film it was. I've been a fan of the Star Wars universe ever since. It was with great excitement I watched the latest episode VII. As usual the movie began with the scrolling text laying out the current scenario. Already at this point it seemed a bit weak and very similar to previous plots. It did not take long to begin predicting what would happen in many of the scenes. I often blurted out to my family, \"don't tell me they're going to copy that scene from (insert scene from other episode) here.\" My wife would say \"Oh no, they would do that.\" They did! I was able to predict events and even dialogue nearly verbatim because the movie continually reused the twists and turns of previous installments. My wife who is also a Star Wars fan agreed wholeheartedly with my ho-hum reaction. Our son (also a fan) left less than 30 minutes in. I won't go into all the details of how the movie stole so much from the previous films as you can surely read them in other reviews. I wanted so much to enjoy and love this movie as I did all the others, but honestly it was boring. Whereas I've watched each of the previous Star Wars films numerous times, I seriously doubt I will ever waste two hours watching this one again. I can't imagine how it was possible to take such a fantastic imaginative story like Star Wars and make it this boring. How is it possible that not one new idea sprang up in someones mind in the ten years since the last episode? There was no character development to speak of either. I really can't think of one takeaway from this film that would be beneficial to watching any future episode either. Dull, unimaginative, and boring best describes the movie. I'm a little upset that more was not done with the opportunity to add to such a brilliant legacy. I'm not sure what JJ. Abrams was thinking and I can't understand how George Lucas allowed this cinematic travesty.  I have never been so disappointed in a movie before. Edited to add: I have now gone and read some of the other reviews here. It seems that EVERY review I saw is rated 1 out of 10 with the odd 4 or 5, so how is it possible this movie has an 8.3 average??? Something smells odd here.\n",
      "An abomination I put the spoiler alert... but there is little to spoil here. It's just something that should never have been filmed. It's my fault, a friend of mine warned me. And I remember I didn't care, \"it's Star Wars, I even enjoyed the I, II, III... When I see the logo and the music starts... they should really try very hard to ruin it for me. What can they do so bad?\" Well... They destroy everything Star Wars was about: The Force as a mystical thing? Now it's just \"superpowers\", and you don't need to train. You have them, that's all. And even a spoiled brat with daddy issues has, sometimes, more powers than Yoda or Palpatine... Of course, only sometimes. Sense? None. They go for a map to find a guy that run away (and for some reason left a map???) and the reason is... is... why is that important to find him? Specially when there is a new Death Star to be destroyed? No reason at all. Because it's Luke. That's it. Dark side vs Light side? Now, the \"new heroin\" beats the bad guy without any training, because she's really angry. I guess, in some place, Palpatine was laughing \"yes, use your anger\"... But in this new Star Wars is OK, she has superpowers, that's all. You don't need calm to control the Force and, in fact, it's the bad guy who gets tempted by the light side... WTH??????? Consistency with TRotJ? If the Rebels won, shouldn't the \"bad guys\" be the new \"rebels\"? No, they are pretty much the Empire. What happened? Why? Don't expect any answer in the flick. Somebody told me it's supposed to be explained somewhere. I don't care. If you need web pages or books just to explain the main plot of a movie, that movie is really bad storytelling. Period. Great villains? (Vader, Maul, Palpatine...) Now the villain is a kid with anger control and daddy issues, some pathetic little kid not even stormtroopers respect. They give them more \"superpowers\" than Yoda and Palpatine together, they made him kill the most iconic Star Wars character, just to try to make him look bad-ass... And yet, you just want to ask him for him lunch money. Just pathetic. The character and the effort of Abrams to make him charismatic. The first time we saw Vader he just walked, looked around... and we knew you shouldn't mess with him. No need for superpowers. That's called being \"charismatic\". This guy is the new Jar Jar, but worst. Jar Jar wasn't meant to be scary. And stupid. The poor guy wants to be like Vader... The same Vader that saved the day at the end of the OT and ended up being a good guy???? That Vader???? Adventures? as we already know the plot of the movie... not so much. Great settings? A desert. Woodlands. That's all. Even if you didn't like the episodes I, II, III, you have things to enjoy: Naboo, Coruscant... Here... NOTHING. No new design to awe you. TIES, X- Wings... that's all. The Galaxy just got really, really small. The first minutes, with the Star Destroyers in the desert, are OK. The rest... I could only thing \"please, I really want this to end already\". It felt like a 10 hour movie to me. The only thing OK was Solo and we all know how that ended... My brain just couldn't understand why the Star Wars music was in this B-Rate bad pilot for a TV series. And the worst of all, when it ended... The silence in the cinema. And i felt... dirty, but emotionally flat. I don't feel anger towards the movie or Abrams. I didn't feel anything. With the pass of the weeks I ended up feeling something: sadness. I really can't understand why people with half a brain can say this is not a disgrace and even argue is one of the best. I really can't. For me... it's just the end. I'll enjoy the first 6 movies and try to forget this disgrace. I really felt dirty when the movie finished. Disney can forget about my money. And I write this several weeks after wasting my money for this... thing.\n",
      "The IMDb rating is mighty fishy... I wouldn't have taken the time nor the effort to post a written review of this movie were it not for the suspiciously inflated IMDb score of 8.5. Curious, I scrolled through the first 20 PAGES of reviews and counted exactly 5 positive ones. The many negative reviews gave it one star explicitly to balance out the ridiculous score it now has overall.  I will do the same and I urge everyone else who gave it 5 stars or less to amend your review and give it a one star rating instead. The IMDb books are cooked. I'm not a conspiratorial person by nature but with so much money at stake I have to believe that the House of Mouse might have had something to do with it.  At any rate I would honestly rate it a 6 out of 10. But my sense of fair play bids me give it only one star.\n",
      "Star wars : The copy awakens Why o why after almost 40 years is the same exact movie recreated as the one from 1977 ? This so called blockbuster is an exact copy of episode 4 with little bits from 5 thrown in to fill the 2 hour running time. Even the soundtrack is more or less the same. I can understand the fans wanting something that securely sits in the star wars universe, but a 100% exact copy ? What is the point of this movie, what is its audience ? Most people, even the kids, will have seen the original many many times on TV, in home cinemas or on the small screen that's in front of you in tourist class when flying long haul, there is no need for a copy. Really annoying is the political correctness in this movie, here we have a black main character and a Hispanic side kick, of course all the evil is done by white men, so the Asians are missing , so you can be sure that the replacement for a character that's killed off in this episode will pop up next time and be Asian, o my. Near the end of the movie i found myself shouting \"look at the size of this thing !\", but not in an amused , but rather annoyed way. If you like things being blown up, stormtroopers still missing everyone with their \"Peeew peeew\" blasters and gender neutral toilets, go see it ! Otherwise just look at episode 4 yet again.\n",
      "The Force Falls Asleep Well I finally went to see the movie, with a total of 5 others in the theater! As I feared, the force has fallen asleep. This was pathetic as I kept seeing the same story, the same roles, doing the same things and everything else as it was before. Heck, even the animated chess board on the Millennium Falcon was activated (and probably right back to where it was left 30 years ago)! OMG is this the best they could come up with? Really? Hiding underneath the floor/deck in the MF, is that all they can think up? Oh but hey, the MF has a new radar dish on it, rectangular shaped vs round...30 years allowed for that significant advancement. The XWing fighters are still the same, after 30 years? Even the US Air Force upgrades to better technology in 30 years. Even the alien band playing looked very familiar in the dark café/club....Where was the Rancour? (sp?). Even an evil alien there transmitting 'top secret' information...oh so boring, boring! We have a masked bad guy with dark powers and all the rest... Really! OMG this was boring and painful to watch. The movie previews for other movies before this sleepy rehash were more interesting! And a big cavern/hole for someone to fall down into... I guess Han Solo/HF said kill me please, I can't take this same old drama again after 30 years. I could go on and on, and I'm sure it's all been covered by other reviewers but at least I have said my part. JJ, a major disappointment, pathetic that this is all you could come up with. And Mark Hamill/LS didn't even say a word, how silly. I won't be buying this on BluRay and I won't bother to see the next movie. Yawn, the force is putting me to sleep, darn mitochondria (sp?) are acting up again, laughing at me for spending money to see the same old over again!\n",
      "Cover version This movie was like one of those tribute bands playing cover versions on the nostalgia circuit. You feel as if you have seen and heard the original and much better version and this is just a replica and a fake. Why would be surprised though? Disney is famed for having no talent. How many versions of, Hunchback Of Notre Dame, Captain America, Bambi, etc etc. has this company churned out? Yup, so why should they now start to create something new or exciting now? To make matters worse, the cash hounds did not notice that: No one can magically master the force in a day... No one can simply scan the cosmos and find a space ship just like that (er, space is like er you know kinda big place) The troopers are clones and are all alike so no one cannot be black and just for fun here is another one: on a raid and assault to retrieve plans (see I told you it is a rip off) you do not take a sewage cleaner soldier with you... Fine, you got the leading girl, the black trooper and the cute robot (now available at authorized dealers, outlets and websites for purchase...costing you $$ even though they are Made in China and cost 3 cents to produce) but for me four things come to mind: I am boycotting Disney going forward. That is right, you can call it Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar whatever I am out. I am boycotting JJ 'Master Hack' Abrams and producers Tommy Harper and Ben Rosenblatt going forward for being money hungry dream destroying douches and finally will never ever again trust the media and reviewers again. You are all exposed as frauds.\n",
      "Here is a joke: JJ Abrams! This huckster is the shining example of all that is wrong with Hollywood. Zero talent, zero entertainment value, zero creativity and definitely no artistic integrity. Actually if he ever reads this interview he will laugh out loud. He thinks all these concepts are dated. All he cares about is cash and remaking and rebooting. No wonder he is either called Mr Rip off or Jar Jar Abrams. He and Disney fit one another.  RIP Star Wars.\n",
      "Use the Schwarz, J.J.! .. after Mel Brooks in Spaceballs. J.J.Abrams should have stuck to something he does not kill. The Force in this case. If there would be justice, this movie would never have been created due to copyright infringement. Except that those rich enough can buy up anything, strip it from the essential values and present a much worse version, erasing the past. The original from 77' was a classic: reinvention of the sci-fi genre, storyline, visuals, morality. This one was obviously hyped by global branding worthy of the 21st century. And that's exactly the issue: a 10 for marketing, but a mediocre 6 for the actual product, the movie, which in my book means a 2, just to pull the odds straight on a fair voting result. Here's the why: 1. Storyline: an EXACT copy of Episode 4, the first Star Wars movie ever made! Poor hero(ine) coincidentally meets droid that holds plan that is key to master plan - meet Han Solo / Chewbacca - meet forces of good – fighting forces of evil where black-masked prime-evil guy turns out to be family member – while fighting evil dude on bridge, planet-sized planet-destroying machine needs to be destroyed, before it erases all the good guys - fighter plane fight after disabling shielding device - shooting in tunnel - last-minute destruction of monstrosity by hitting it with a few loose guns at its core, which is practically unprotected. Everything is EXACTLY THE SAME in this sequel, almost 40 years after having made the first such movie, when the whole story was still original! This obviously shows the intent to address the second and third generation of kids, the children of those who saw the original. It adds absolutely nothing however in originality. 2. Casting: having said it's a rip-off, it doesn't stop there. Aged actors from the original movie (Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Best Friend Chewbacca) line up to remind us that this IS Star Wars. This time around however to appeal to the \"elder\" generation: those who were kids when they first watched SW and should now feel connected enough to keep bringing their kids to the remaining two episodes as well.. The younger actors (Finn, Rey, Kylo Ren) however are just a joke. While Finn is the funny guy who needs to appeal to insecurities in all of us and never takes off his surprised-look mask (despite chopping up half the galaxy while he's \"doing the right thing\"), Rey is the next-gen copy of Luke Skywalker, except it's the 21st-cent politically correct (female) version that speaks as if she just left drama class, but despite the haughtiness of noblesse, feels the need to stomp around like a fishwife. Unlike the old Luke\", she is a modern control-freak, the emancipated girl-power type, sweat dripping in buckets by the effort of balancing femininity with the pseudo-liberal BS of \"equality\". Literally the actress is overwhelmed by her role and she simply overdoes it where most would have failed anyway, but better casting would still have saved some face. Third in row is the hysterical spoiled brat Kylo Ren, who sounds quite cool while still in his mask, if only he would not behave like a 5 year old who is easier manipulated than a puppy and looses the sinister image as soon as he takes off his mask and starts smashing furniture at the slightest setback. Reminds us of the same mistake made with using Hayden Christensen who played Anakin Skywalker turning from naive kid to hurt adolescent in Episode 3. Shouldn't that have been a sign for J.J.Abrams not to make the same mistake of taking away coolness from a Jedi?.. Breaking kitchenware will hardly appeal to any 21st century kid when the prime-evil character needs a touch of coolness. I don't even go into detailing the new \"wise\" CGI character of the 21st century politically-correct (female) version of Yoda, a passing whim with not a fraction of Yoda's charisma, despite being 1000 years of age. Oh, the glasses..yeah, I guess that makes her wise. Just shows how poor of a job the director did, if a character needs glasses to gain some respect from the viewer. Maybe a tattoo like \"I'm the smartest chick around the block\" would have been even more obvious J.J., on her forehead! To sum up the cast(rat)ing change: while almost 40 years ago we had a kid with hidden talents and a strong sister who finally melted by the charms of a bounty hunter, with the most bad-ass black-masked Evil of all times, J.J.Abrams now gave us panicky Finn, angry Rey and hysterical K-ren.. Just shows you Hollywood does not want role-models kids could look up to but gives them excuses for being like a wet rag. 3. Dialogues and character development: repetitive, simplistic jokes that were trendy when they first appeared by Spielberg in the eighties in the Indiana Jones franchise. Are they still cool 30 years later?.. If J.J. Abrams partners with Spielberg in the future, I would understand his urge to comply with the Master of Hollywood's flat directing style at the cost of authenticity, but for everyone else it's time travel backwards and not in a nostalgic sense. The movie and the reviews show that it pays off to totally remake a movie with no originality, poor acting, not even using minor storyline techniques to show anything new, brainwashing the audience to even reviewing it positively and not even to be punished for it. It's cheap, it's a disgraceful abuse of an original idea and all the energy put into the original movie and makes me wonder why this should be allowed in the first place. At any case, it robs a whole generation that grew up with Star Wars from its past, to replace it with a cheap remake.\n",
      "Been There, Done That **SPOILER ALERT** **SPOILER ALERT**  Wow, this movie was an identical to is predecessors... nothing new here Check list:  Young Jedi on a desert plant - Check!    Death star - Check!    Resistance pilot flying through the tunnel to destroy the death star - Check!    Crappy robot with secret message - Check!    Han Solo - Check!   Evil dude covered with black mask - Check!  But what really annoys me, is that a young Jedi who 30 minutes ago thought that The Force is a myth and Luke is a legend learned how to use the force in 1 day and defeats the evil masked guy who is training in the force his entire life....\n",
      "Sponging on market profits since the last Star wars movie Repeat same story line from previous episodes that consisting of the following a twin was born (a boy and a girl),  there are two bad guys who are Sith Lords the bad guys are building an artificial planet that is also a very powerful weapon the good guys will fight the bad guys with a few planes and is good enough to finish off the artificial planet. It is always that Sith Lords work in pairs, and refused to learn the lesson that two will always lose out to all the Jedis. And the Sith Lords always like to build an artificial planet, despite learning that the idea will never match a few good planes bombing its energy core. This really came at an expense on the quality of work and story of Disney.\n",
      "Poor JJ abrams He works hard for the money, sooo hard for the money, he works hard for the moneeey and still can't get it right!!!!! (all rights to copyright holder Donna Summers) This thing is so bad that they would not even admit that it is a remake. They presented as a new episode. Yes, another orphan on a desert planet with a sewage scrubbing clone soldier who is nothing like his progenitor and is wondering (like us) why he was sent on a raid when there were sewers to clean up back wherever he came from (he was already mixed up looking at photos of his ancestor who looks nothing like him, imagine how confused he is now.. so confused that he rebels against his boss)... And just to make this money sucking abomination so 2015 cool make our black and female (anyone watched Ghostbusters 2016)? Nothing against women or blacks mind you love them all but JJ Abrams go do some community service you are so predictable and untalented. Thanks for ruining Star Wars.  Thanks to JJ Disney Star Wars is now as unhip and uncool as a Donald Drumpf cold sore STD mouth-to-mouth kiss\n",
      "the laughs on me the sucker a vapid and uninspired exercise in funneling cash from me to Hollywood, Abrams and the synagogue this was the new template for making money. take someone else's work and reshoot with minor variations and call it a new episode. Lucas cashed in and sold out and sadly does not care anymore. The old actors were also desperate for cash so sold out and showed up. The reviewers and media also dared not be honest and were blinded by cash. It is up to us to at least learn from our mistakes and deny episode 8 the success to send a message to Disneywood that we are not losers.How by boycotting the next 12 episodes, offshoots, producer and this terrible director.\n",
      "Completely pointless and uninventive self-parody There is literally nothing in SW:TFA that is not directly lifted from the first 3 Star Wars Movies. In those, a fascist empire (headed by a masked weirdo) wanted to conquer the world. Two children were hidden, both of whom had latent magic powers; and a weapon of mass destruction was the target of the rebellion's attacks. The funny thing is, the trilogy culminated with a destruction of the aforementioned fascist empire and the WMD. So guess what the imaginative folk at LucasFilm do... They write a formulaic plot which has two children with magic powers; and a weapon of mass destruction wielded by a fascist empire. It's just a complete recursive reboot. Can they not think of story lines anymore?  This is the dumbest movie I've ever seen. Oscar Isaac should be ashamed of himself.\n",

      "Unimaginative reboot! Star Wars is dead. I've been a Star Wars fan since I was a young boy. I don't know every corner and crevice of the Star Wars universe, but I know it quite well so I was pretty excited about a new film. Well, let me just say that I am very disappointed with J.J. Abrams and Disney. They had the opportunity to create something fresh and meaningful and an chance to add to the story but instead they recreated A New Hope with a few new characters and far less appeal. Way to go Disney!! I won't go into details since there are a ton of YouTube videos and articles on the Web that already do that, but to put it all in a nut shell, The Force Awakens is a film we have all already seen. The only thing that is new is some in your face political correctness. I will not be going to the theater to see the follow up films, and will wait for them to come out on Netflix. I know I won't be missing much if anything at all.\n",
      "More Like the Force Is Derailed There may be spoilers in this write up.  I originally gave this movie a rating of \"5\", based solely on it's very good 3-D effects. After thinking about it though, I realized I was being way too generous considering that once the 3-D version runs are through at the movie houses, we'll only be left with standard viewing versions. In light of that, I knocked my rating back to a \"2\". You can read a lot of the other low rated reviews to find many of the issues I have with the poor casting, the director's vision(?), and the sad acting, so I won't bother going there. What REALLY bugs me about this movie is that it does not continue the Star Wars saga. In 1977 we were introduced to this wonderful, new universe. At sometime we were promised a 9 movie collection, with 3 films focused on the now, 3 more delving into the past, and a final 3 taking us to the future.  The present went off without a hitch. The past was finally shown to us after an awful 16 year delay. When those 3 films ended in 2005, who would have thought it would be another 11 years before we got a glimpse into the future. Finally, that time has arrived, only to find there seemingly is no future since this movie only represents a retelling of the 1977 original dressed up in modern technology and a sad mix of new and old characters. What should have been over and done with in 20 years has now taken 39, with 2 movies still to go. What's worse, is that now I have no idea when the next installment comes out if it will actually be a continuation of the saga, or just a sad remake of \"Return of the Jedi\".  They seriously need to fire the director, hire some real writers, and get this story back on track.\n",
      "Wha. Tapee. Sashit. I once read a Superman comic as a kid back in the 1970's, where Supes travels into the future by zipping around the earth at super-speed, thus crossing the international dateline over and over. And at the end of the story, to get back to his own time, he of course zips around the earth IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. Even as a ten-year old, I can remember thinking, \"But that's just stupid.\" I regretfully gave up reading Superman. I had exactly the same feeling watching the sun-vacuuming Starkiller base (Death Star cubed?) zapping all the Republic homeworlds, which of course are all within naked-eye sight of each other, in a few minutes FROM A DISTANT STAR SYSTEM, while the Resistance watches the event unfold like they are watching a fireworks display. (Don't even get me started on the whole \"killer beam splits into five\" when halfway there.) That is by no means where the howlers end. I could go on about the tentacle monster trying to suck the windshield off the Millennium Falcon while the Yakuza thugs whom it had been trying to eat a few minutes before stand calmly nearby trying to blast their way in. Funny, yes. But not in a good way. I could go on about the First Order building a super-duper Death Star with exactly the same design flaw which caused its destruction TWICE before. Or the chasm in the planet which SO conveniently opens up between Rey and Kylo Ren JUST after she beats him in a lightsaber duel.  Or about Rey turning out to be a super-mechanic, pilot and Jedi adept in a matter of hours, with no training. Beating Kylo Ren in a duel the first time she picks up a light sabre. Performing Jedi mind tricks instantly, despite never having heard of the Force before. How did it even occur to her to try it? I'VE heard of it, and it STILL wouldn't occur to me to try to command my way out of a speeding ticket (\"these aren't the droids you're looking for, officer...\"). No, DON'T try to tell me the Force is whispering in her ear. If she's just an empty vessel for the miti-chlorians, or whatever, why should I care about the character? They could just as easily have chosen C-3PO to be their super-powered Jedi hero. Come to think of it, that would be kinda cool... And that brings me to another problem with the movie -- I don't care about any of the characters. Lots of movies are full of sci-fi bits that stretch credibility to the breaking point. Guardians of the Galaxy springs to mind. But that movie was full of charisma, character development, and excellent writing, so by the end I really gave a poop about Quill and Rocket and company. Not here. Abrams is so busy rushing through the story, re-hashing beats from Episode 4, that there is no time for me to get invested in Finn or Rey or Kylo Ren. The writing is clumsy, half-hearted, lazy and uninspired, and audiences deserved better.\n",
      "No plot mishmash with miserable weak new faces This SW movie was a huge disappointment for me, after so many positive critics and being a real fan of episode 4-6. First of all there was NO plot. Even episode1 had more. It was a remake and CGI orgy for the hard-core fans. The only positive things were the visual effects (X-wings vs Ties). Indeed this story played somewhere in the SW universe (well more punctually somewhere between the SW universe and a MAD MAX world). Beside no realistic and sensible story the new actors/characters were also disastrous. SPOILER! - SPOILER! - SPOILER!  The nonsense, no plot background:   After all the biggest problems of all post episode4-6 stories are that they must be bigger than the previous ones. So there is no T-Rex sized, planet destroyer Deathstar, but we have a Godzilla sized, multi-planet, star killer planet. Oh, my God! Why??? Creativity on the top. How??? The First Order was able to create at least a ten times bigger super weapon than the Empire could. What resources could be reached by First Order? The Empire exposed over the Galaxy (including the core worlds) and the First Order?    What the Resistance stands for? Why not the Republic? Were episode 1-3 so bad that Coruscant had to be destroyed in a blink, or the Resistance knew in advance what would come upon Coruscant so a bunch of the republic warriors separated under the command of general warlord Leia?    Luke is shamed, so he hided away, but he left a map fragment to find him challenging the rest of the Galaxy, yes very understandable.   Is R2-D2 a holly \"notobetouched\" saint grail? No. It is just a droid. But a few billion must have died before it turns itself on. No one dared to turn it on.   Luke would be the greatest Jedi at that time, Kylo would be no match for Him (as Rey (a definitely very strong, but unskilled force user) defeated him and also Vader was mentioned as a stronger one than Kylo, who was defeated by Luke). And for unknown reason Kylo wanted to find him, maybe he had some suicide feelings.   Has Harrison Ford asked too much money for episode 8 and 9?   For all these reasons all the characters are running up and down through the Galaxy concentrating all the essentials of episode 4-6. We got: - a desert planet with a female young Luke living in a Mad Max world, - an ice planet with lots of Imperials, which is also a super-sized starkiller planet, - a forest planet (no ewoks, but with a mockyoda creature, looking like it comes from episode1-3, you know the force seeing little one with large glasses and a cave like place where the trainee meets her force visions by Dagobah) - a remote planet (the HQ of rebels resistance, where Princess Leia sweats for his friends in front of the maps with the help of C3-PO), surrounded by an asteroid belt (no space slug) - and the Millennium Falcon popping in by Han and Chewbacca. But the orgy of remake scenes has not stopped: - Of course Han and Chewbacca are smugglers again (Why not? After he became a General of the victorious Alliance and he is husband of Leia (current general of resistance), and they are smuggling again: Aliens from Prometheus. - The desert planet is full of wrecks of episode 4-6 vehicles. - We have a son and dad talk again. - All the important characters reappear (even Vader in some way), but without any reason. (where was Lando?) - And again and again the X-wings clash with the ties (only X-wings, who knows why no A,B,Y or any new cool starfighter. The disastrous characters:  Kylo Ren, the masked one (like Bane from Batman). Please decide do you want to look like Darth Vader or not. If yes, why the mask so unique? If no, why the mask? Still the mask at least disguised the fact that he is young Prof. Severus Snape from Hogwarts. And his childish rage manner    Finn, who mostly sweat and starred horrified, when he not lightsabered. But why, oh why? Is he a skilled Jedi, or what? And he successfully duels twice with the lightsaber. Remember, how easily a man with a sword can be shot down? As Han Indiana Jones did in the Raiders of the Lost Ark? So, it is so obvious that other stormtrooper yelling \"traitor\" clashes Finn with an electric baseball club instead of shooting him down. By the way, there are so many stormtroopers, how he was able to recognize FN123 in that leather jacket? And the other nonsense part: Kylo also dueled him. What? A sith/dark jedi(?) duels a completely forceless man? And that man even hurts Kylo. Could you imagine Darth Vader in such a situation?   General Hux from Hunger Games. Until his speech it was not so obvious that he is a general at age of 16. And that mass gathering scene, it was more like Pink Floyd The Walls's scene with that huge red&amp;black banner, than Star Wars. Just compare to the Emperors arrival in episode 6.   Captain Phasma, the mysterious (shadow trooper?) one. They were so cute make her not wearing her helmet with a transmitter installed in it during her captivity.   and finally: we have also a Thanos on his throne. After all it is a Disney production.  Ps: If someone could id. another franchise in this movie other than Mad Max, Harry Potter, Alien, Marvel, Bat Man, please let us know. (Apart from Back to the Future's kitchenware :)\n",
      "Too Nostalgic, but Still Good With a series as beloved as Star Wars, anything is possible. The Force Awakens, the beginning of the sequel trilogy, is quite possibly the most anticipated movie of all time. The fact that it reeled in a record breaking $250,000,000 opening weekend in the U.S. alone is a testament to the popularity of this franchise. So, was it worth the wait? That's an interesting question. For many people, myself included, the nostalgia blinders came with the movie. The anticipation before the opening crawl and the euphoria that that classic opening note brought was an unforgettable experience. This movie brought out happy memories of watching the Original Trilogy for the first time, and the wonder and mystery that the galaxy of Star Wars brought us. However, the movie relies way too much on the nostalgia factor. The best and most memorable things about this movie (aside from that scene, of course) were the opening crawl, the appearance of the Millennium Falcon, the first appearances of the original characters (especially Han and Chewie), and the scene with Darth Vader's helmet. Aside from those things, it's a carbonite copy of the original 1977 movie, with the exact same story arc. There's very little originality, which is a massive detractor. Even the ships and vehicles are exactly the same, with a few exceptions. Of course, Starkiller Base is just another Death Star, even if the way it works is awesome. Even the character's roles feel recycled from the Original Trilogy. Rey is Luke (the desert dwelling, force sensitive protagonist), Finn is Han (The guy who tries to stay out of it but ends up coming back in), Poe is Leia (The one with the droid with the important message), BB-8 is R2-D2 (said droid), Han is Obi-Wan (The mentor who fought in the previous war), and Luke is Yoda (The Jedi who is now a recluse). While this is bad, it doesn't mean the characters are bad. They're not entirely recycled, but the roles they play certainly are. This isn't a bad movie, though. There really is a lot to like. The new characters were pretty good. With Rey, they set her up as a very mysterious figure, one you wonder about regarding who she is and where she's going. While Force Awakens doesn't reveal any of that, it sets it up for later installments. (By the way, this review is judging TFA independently from Last Jedi). Finn goes from being a cowardly deserter to someone who stands up and fights for his cause. Poe's nothing to write home about. Kylo Ren is simultaneously the best character in this movie and the worst. He's the best at the beginning, when you first see him in the black armor with the hood up. He looks awesome. Without the helmet, he's not so great. BB-8 is just about the cutest droid/robot ever. Also extremely marketable. Snoke was great. Han and Chewie really stole the show, mostly because of how long its been since they had screen time together. And also, unlike with the Prequels, when you know what's going to happen, as you've probably seen the Originals, there's a feeling of suspense where you know the characters you've grown to love are in danger, and you desperately want to see them come out OK. Oh, and, you know that feeling when you really want to talk about a movie spoiler but you can't because not everyone saw it as early as you? Yeah. This really went into effect here. Upon the first viewing of this movie, the nostalgia factor made it appear much better than it actually is. I thought this movie was a solid 9/10 after seeing it for the first time. It really isn't. It's still a good movie, though. Most of the callbacks to the original trilogy were welcome, the visuals are spectacular, John Williams continues his perfect track record, and most importantly, it got us interested in where they would take the series with the next installment.\n",
      "Superb Thankfully, the Star Wars franchise can get back to fun, and character, and unpredictability. After the durge created by the flaccid prequel trilogy, where there was no emotion, nor effort to wield a lightsaber, and no need to develop personality, it's great to see an unhinged evil character, an uncertain female protagonist, and an awesome droid!  Fanboys will obviously lament not having back stories and canon adherence to \"the force\", or that stuffy old men aren't as prolific in this new version, but this is the way forward, not dwelling in the past.  Lucas proved he was no director with EPS 1-3, so it is great to have the mantle handed over to film makers.\n",
      "Few risks, fan service and opening some questions My title sums up this movie. You want to see the Falcon? A cool red light-saber? Han and Chewie? And see a bunch of X-wings destroy the Deat... I mean Starkiller base? Well, you'll get it. \n",
      "Casting is pretty decent, Poe, Finny and even BB8 are kinda okay. Rey, I still don't know what to think of her. A bit too naïve and innocent in my opinion but she's not annoying at least. And Kylo... Kylo is pretty much the risk this movie has taken, by making him look really awesome with his outfit, saber and mask aaaaand surprising you when you see his face. I think it was a good choice in the end.\n",
      "It's a solid and simple star wars movie. A bit of plot and \"star wars science\" holes, like how in such a huge galaxy can they see the shot of starkiller and the explosion of the planets? Unless they're in the same system, not possible. During the fight after Maz Cantina gets blown up... where did everyone go? The cantina was full. Somehow only Han and friends get out of the debris. Rey's awakening is a bit weird but why not. Personally I would have made her force sensitive when she's running after Finn who's going to get eaten by the weird worm creatures on Han's ship. Not even going to ask why did those creatures insta kill all the bad guys but they capture Finn... with all those tentacles, don't ask. \n",
      "Anyways, a good and entertaining star wars movie. Good action, decent actors, good CGI. Just a bit too predictable.\n",
      "7 but still my least favorite I have to be honest with myself. For some reason when I watched this movie it felt like there was something missing. The prequels to the original get so much constant hate and criticism and no one points out the positive things about those movies.. .. I actually enjoyed watching those movies more than this one despite some cheesy lines, over use of CGI and annoying characters like JaJa.. \n",
      " I feel this way because episodes 1-3 still had that magic touch.. I don't know what it is but it still maintained a certain type of feel and flow of the original movies. It had things about those movies that were very memorable, original, yet still felt familiar.. That is what I feel was lacking in this one. There was nothing about it that really stood out.. It tried to be Star Wars so hard, but it failed. It just felt like \"someone else\" was trying to copy and remake the Star Wars theme.. None of the characters were memorable.. None of the fight scenes were really memorable.. Each one of the Star Wars movies before it had something that really stood out . I could watch all six of the Star Wars movies over again .... But this one I feel like after watching it once.. I don't really care if I see it again. Even Harrison Ford didn't look into it. It was like someone dragged him out of bed and forced him to do this movie.. His acting was very lack luster.  There was no imagination in this movie but simply a rehash without the same flow and rhythm of the other six.. \n",
      "Here's what stands out for me. . \n",
      "Ep 1 - Darth maul.. 10x better of a character.. the one in force awakens felt more like watching a space balls villain .... Pod racing.. That really stood out.. The music and fight scenes with darth maul... Awesome acting by liam Neeson and McGreggor..  Ep2- The clone wars battle scene was a pretty epic battle and very memorable. Seeing yoda younger and actually fighting was memorable even if it was funny to watch. A lot of memorable acting and synergy between Anakin and Obi Wan..  Ep3- was dark, told the story that lead up to the originals... The final battle was very memorable.. the ending stood in my mind for awhile... The Emperors acting was on point..  Force awakens- The best thing i liked about it really was the new droid.. Oh and if you want to count a progressive approach having a woman and black guy be the main characters.. but I don't really care about any of that.  My score... originals were my favorite. followed by rogue one and the prequels.. Force Awakens was the least enjoyable to watch for me.\n",
      "What happened to Star Wars? This movie was okay, but not even close to as good as the original trilogy.\n",
      "The Force(d) Awakens J.J. Abrams reignites and revitalizes a galaxy far, far away with raw, practical wonder like never before, with a story that feels like more of an unfulfilling reunion show, but an exhilarating reunion nonetheless.\n",
      "Ever since the prequels, in fact ever since the originals, we (Star Wars enthusiasts) have been anxiously anticipating a return to the Star Wars universe, and ever since it was announced back in 2013, it rose the potential for a brand new trilogy, hopefully out-grown and learned from the prequels, and true to the originals, to create something truly new and extraordinary. \n",
      "With a whole new set of characters, in a whole new set of stories, extraordinary, it is not. \n",
      "I don't want to bum out the incredibly protective fanbase, but if you're hoping for new planets, a different kind of Star Wars story we'd never seen before, or even an exploration of things you'd only dream of, dream again because Force Awakens takes such a safe route that it almost replicates, frame-by-frame, arch-by-arch \"A New Hope\" in a very respectable, but unnecessary way. \n",
      "First and foremost, the problem I have with \"safe movies,\" is there's nothing to hate because no risks were taken. Example given// The Force Awakens.\n",
      "Now, that's not to say I didn't enjoy the movie by any stretch of the imagination because there's so much to love here.\n",
      "There's a certain mold that defines Star Wars and J.J. understands that beautifully. What I mean is the franchise's so-called style sort of rides this fine line of being overly-cheesy and overly-romantic in its cinematic experience. And its a style that really only works with Star Wars, but it's also a style that has become beloved and cherished by millions of people on the planet. And that said, \"The Force Awakens\" fully embraces this style and projects it on a stage of film-making, entertainment and execution that is at an incredibly high-level of craft, higher than almost any previous installment. \n",
      "It's all there. \n",
      "The performances are sensational, and are even better than expected. \n",
      "The returnees such as Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill are all terrific. But it's the new cast that's significant in this one, and do they ever steal the show. \n",
      "Daisy Ridley plays a wondrous scavenger in Rey, who really is the heart and hope of The Force Awakens, giving us a true female hero for this generation. John Boyega plays a runaway stormtrooper named FN217, or aka Finn, and comes across annoying at times, but plays it in a real \"Star Warsy\" way that's effective. But the one to talk about is Adam Driver who plays the emotionally corrupt villain Kylo Ren, who comes across so stellar that in his character's desires to become the next Darth Vader, you actually wish he was as he nails the Star Wars villain with humor and class as good as any before him.\n",
      "So in terms of craft and breaking down the filmmaking elements of \"The Force Awakens,\" this movie has it all. But if those elements are in just a simple, safe story that you wish would go to the next level, then it's just promise. But you put those elements in a daring story, it's extraordinary. \n",
      "Unfortunately, it strays in the prior and stays safe. Without judging the performances, the new characters of Rey, Kylo and Finn are intriguing, but are nothing new. Furthermore where they take these characters, which could've been interesting to any inventive writer, they instead put in them in the default Star Wars character setting in the same-old story-verse we've seen and heard many times before. Now, the default setting isn't a bad thing, it's just that's what's keeping Episode 7 from being extraordinary.\n",
      "Now about the title. This installment delves into a concept that is referred to in the title as \"The Force Awakens.\" Intriguing and relevant to the new trilogy. But as much as it is true in some ways, it isn't as relevant as it needs to be. In fact, to think about it, when was the Force ever Awakening, and when you really think about, there are only really 1 or 2 moments in the grand scale of the journey that makes this relevant in any way.\n",
      "The story actually focuses more on the search for Luke Skywalker, which in retrospect gives more sense to Episode 7 being titled \"The Last Jedi,\" or even \"Search for the Last Jedi.\" But, shouldn't it be exploring its own new fresh awakening, which is why its called Force Awakens in the first place? \n",
      "Yes, and that is where this movie is flawed. \n",
      "Not saying this movie doesn't go anywhere, it certainly does especially in the last act of the film. Its just for a good portion of this episode, we're left waiting in anxiety and we start to force our own awakening and wonder upon this movie in hopes it'll create some of it's own. It eventually does, but the line from the Yoda-like character referred to as Maz says, \"a different question for a different time,\" completely defines this movie.\n",
      "Then until its final breathes, do we realize this may just be where the story really gets going. But it ends right there. Sure, it was a fun ride, but there were so much unfulfilled desires and hopes in the story and characters, other than the craftsmanship, there's really no reason to revisit Force Awakens other than getting giddy about a few promises that are soon to come, in sequels ahead.\n",
      "Yes, I am going overboard with the criticism here. But there was potential to take this installment in a direction that could've been extraordinary and new. The filmmaking was there, the performances were all there, but I feel as though the production was too in awe that they were making a Star Wars movie, and gave us something fun that pays too much omage. But that doesn't mean it isn't an exhilarating voyage into a galaxy far, far away.\n",
      "Its exuberant, fresh and has moments with awe that slice you right through the heart. Yes, it has its flaws, but every Star Wars movie does\n",
      "In the end of the day, this is a fine addition to an already celebrated and unprecedented saga that only brushes the surface, but brushes it in the most exciting way imaginable and leaves us a lot to look forward to. May the Force Be With You!\n",
      "An average Star Wars movie While doing her routine search for items which will bring her daily dose of food, Rey saves a tiny droid which is in need of even more help. Carrying an important piece of information, it must be taken urgently to the rebels. Together with a new friend, she'll have to face many adventures until the BB-8 completes its quest before the First Order gets its hands on him. This instalment of the Star Wars franchise has its story set in a time where The First Order has only the last hiding forces of the rebels to defeat before taking complete control. Young Rey is introduced into the story, along with her special abilities, who will prove to be a key factor in what is to come. We follow her, throughout many perils, full of captivating CGI and action sequences, typical to the series. Unfortunately, these are the main pluses of the movie, and not the same can be said about the story and the characters. Many are annoying or simply stupid, without a clear idea of their role, contributing one way or another to a story which simply doesn't provide something truly great. It is just OK, not very predictable but also not very complex, doing its job but nothing more.  I found it to be quite an average film, with only a couple of characters which are pleasant and dignified to be watched, bringing some substance to an average story which also contains characters which simply shouldn't exist, which have a tendency of getting on your nerves more than being useful. Besides this problems, if you look closer, you can still find some good aspects which ultimately transform this movie into a rather good watch. It still looks great, has plenty of action, and at least two or three good characters which somehow make up to the other disappointments. Overall, I found an average movie, which definitely could have been a lot better, but it simply fell into mediocrity due to a lack of story complexity and character development. I'm pretty sure that the series' fans will be disappointed with it, but for me it was somewhat OK.\n",
      "Recycled, nostalgic, and practically perfect JJ Abrams is really good at this: recycle the plot, reconfigure the characters and let the action take center stage. It is a simple formula. And it makes this movie cook with gas. Despite basically being a remake of the first Star Wars - from the plot to the characters - this story feels fresh and fun. Part of that's performances, but most of it is Abrams' sense of pace: more action, less trade policy. The flaws from the original trilogy are all here, especially the plot holes. But it is hard to notice them when you are having this much fun. Well worth the wait. (Let's pretend those prequels never happened.)\n",
      "Bringing back Star Wars !!! There is a moment towards the middle of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' when Han Solo says the following to Rey and Finn - \"It's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true.\" - that particular line of dialogue to me completely and very clearly established and underlines the motive and the intent of JJ Abrams and Disney as a whole behind their collective approach in restarting the Star Wars Saga. Since the souring of the mood and the spirits of the diehard Star Wars fans triggered by the prequels, there had been a prolonged gap. The basic idea of 'The Force Awakens' is to end that gap by reaffirming the myths, the legends and the magic of Star Wars and reassure the fanbase with a film that symbolises the phrase - 'Star Wars(in its original form) is back !!!' \n",
      "To me this idea of reaffirming the legend of 'Star Wars' has two repercussions which are very noticeable in the film. On one hand, certain elements that make the original trilogy wondrous like the joy and innocence of fantasies and adventures, Han Solo's charisma, etc. On the other hand, it also brings along with it the elements that have always prevented me from fully embracing Star Wars which are surface level storytelling, hokey and over-expressive dialogue,etc. Another problem with the film is that in trying to deliver on 'fan service', the film doubles down and flirts with the prospect of being a little over-abundant on references and moments that pay explicit homage to the original trilogy as well as overall narrative throughlines that again blatantly mirror a number of the occurrences in previous films in the series. \n",
      "However what prevents the film from becoming an excuse in nostalgia porn is the characters. The new characters especially Rey and Finn were very likeable and they seem like individuals that I as a viewer would like to accompany in future adventures and spend time with. I mentioned earlier how 'Force Awakens' reaffirms the myths of Star Wars. Through Daisy Ridley's 'Rey', the film goes one step forward by hinting at powers and abilities which are unprecedented and almost incomprehensible(to Rey herself), the sources of which will probably be elaborated upon in the sequels. Harrison Ford manages to embody the swashbuckling Han Solo once again after all these years and it feels like older version of the exact same character from the original trilogy with the same charisma and sarcasm. Kylo Ren seemed interesting enough. \n",
      "In an nutshell the film embodies certain elements that I have never completely been in tune with which are inherent to the concept of Star Wars itself. But having said that, with the basic energy and the exciting new characters, JJ Abrams managed to make me not only care about about this film, but also curious about what's to come next.\n",
      "A remake This film was visually stunning. However I feel it was simply a remake of episode IV: A New Hope with a subplot attached. I was and still am disappointed with the way this movie turned\n",
      "Better than I remember The first time I watched this I thought it was the worst in the saga but now on rewatch I find it the best after the original trilogy. This is the only Star Wars film until that point, including the original trilogy, in which I didn't cringe at a dialogue or acting at some point of the film. The set up of all the new characters and the world is so perfect while giving enough importance to the old characters just enough.\n",
      "Faithful to original films whilst bringing something new. Abrams' achievement in rebooting SW with such faithfulness to the original trilogy will guarantee his place in the history books as perhaps the greatest movie director.\n",
      "I'd give this a 10 if it weren't for \"A New Hope\" I'd have to admit, if this were a standalone film it would be fantastic, because JJ Abrams and his new crew of Star Wars makers did a really good job. However, I have no idea why, but for some reason he and Lawrence Kasdan decided to steal most if not all the aspects of \"A New Hope\" into this new storyline that would either make or break Disney's reputation for how well they can handle Star Wars. So here's my basic analysis of this movie compared to Episode IV (minor spoilers, if you don't want to read ahead). How the plot lines up with Episode IV\n",
      " Stormtroopers, plus a Sith Lord who wears a mask that digitizes his voice, attack the good guys because they have valuable information, and one of the good guys sends off a droid with that information before getting captured. That droid with the valuable information comes across the lead protagonist, on a sandy planet, who later discovers Jedi powers. The stormtroopers find the droid with its Jedi partner, but then they escape in the Millennium Falcon (which the Jedi character regards as trashy). The bad guys have their headquarters on a gigantic fortress that has a cannon that can destroy entire planets. The new Jedi character comes across Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber. The new Jedi and friends come across the team of good guys and go to their planet that is moderately forest but somewhat swampy (I'm almost starting to wonder if it's the same planet in both movies), and discuss how to defeat the bad guys' planet-destroying headquarters. The good guys, with their X-Wings and Y-Wings, attack the enemy headquarters as it's preparing to destroy the good guys' headquarters. The Sith Lord manages to escape alive, along with various other members of his team, for the sake of setting up a sequel.  Here's other features of Episode IV that were placed in out of order\n",
      " A stormtrooper rescues one of the bad guys' prisoners (the same prisoner who sent off the droid with the valuable information). The Millennium Falcon gets captured by tractor-beam. Han Solo has an unsettled debt with criminals. The main characters enter a cantina, where the gad buys have a spy who notices the droid with the valuable information (which later leads to a battle) , and one of the main characters pays someone for transportation. The main characters manually go in to disable the bad guys' fortress' shield. A old, mentor character is killed by the Sith Lord.  Now on the positive side, let me mention some original material (or at the very least, material that makes this plot unique) that this movie had.\n",
      " The new Sith's lightsaber - it not only has the laser hilts, but the saber itself seems to have a different texture to it than most lightsabers. For some reason, none of the Sith are called \"Darth\". New force powers were introduced (such as force freeze and force faint), however I'm not too sure whether that's a plus for this movie. The leading character is female (all the previous Star Wars movies have had male characters), and she lives as a scavenger. A stormtrooper, out of his own conscience, chooses to betray the bad guys; this clearly shows actual personality to them as opposed to the previous Star Wars films, which depicts them as merely expendable objects. The new Jedi is able to discover that she is a Jedi all on her own; in Luke's and Anakin's cases, they needed another Jedi master to tell them that they were Jedi. The second-to-last fight scene is perhaps the most original Star Wars battle to date (the one on the green planet where that cantina is). A non-Jedi wields a lightsaber to fight the bad guys (Han Solo in E. V never fought stormtroopers with Luke's lightsaber, and General Grievous in E. III was already a bad guy). A stormtrooper wields a melee weapon, though this does somewhat compare to the Magnaguards in E. III. The Sith takes off his mask to show how ordinary he is (however, people initially laughed at his non-masked appearance). The Jedi=Sith battle at the end showed that neither side had too much experience with lightsabers. The valuable information contained by the droid isn't about defeating the bad guys, but it sets up the sequel.  The only reason why everyone has been rating this film 1-5 is because of how much of a remake of E. IV this is. I can totally understand their disappointment, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the movie itself was bad. I do agree that I was a little dumbfounded to see that this movie was too exact to E. IV, but I do still think that this movie was good enough to set a good reputation for Disney occupying Star Wars (you can at least admit that this movie was better than the prequels, right?).\n",
      "Like I said before, this is the only reason why I am rating this a 7; otherwise, I would have rated it a 10.\n",
      "Good old Star Wars action but déjà vu First of all, as a huge Star Wars fan, I find that seeing a Star Wars movie on IMAX 3D with the latest CGI technology was astonishing. That movie was very beautiful. It successfully captured the essence of a Star Wars movie and I am not just talking about space and Jedi battles. I am talking about the mythical aspect of it like the good versus evil, light and dark, hope and despair contradictions. I am also talking about the constant change between order and stability for chaos and destruction. The story was dramatic and interesting but nothing we haven't already seen. This movie has so many similarities with A New Hope that it can be seen has an attempt to make easy money with the less effort possible. Seriously, the \"Empire\" has a huge super weapon and the \"Rebels\" need to stop it before it blows up planets. A mentor dies to help the greater cause. The apprentice uses her new found power to fight off the dark side. There wasn't much originality in the story but it the movie was still successful at capturing the essence of Star Wars. I really liked the new actors that they chose for this film. Especially John Boyega as Finn. That guy with BB8 were they comic duo of the movie. I really enjoyed watching them. Lupita Nyong'o is such a good actress. The way she acted, we were able to truly feel that Maz Kanata was very ancient and mystical. As for Rey, I wouldn't say that she was the best of the group but she played her role just fine. The only actor that I didn't feel that was fitting was Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. It's like Anakin Skywalker all over again but worst. I can understand that the Director wanted us to see that Kylo Ren is very conflicted between good and evil because of his ties to his family. That he was not a slave like Anakin and that he had everything before going to the dark side which make him looks like nothing is enough. The character really looked more immature than he should be. Even though he was a grown man, to me, he looked like a winy teenager. Finally, I could have been harder on the movie and give it less than a 7 but even though the story was not original, the actors and the universe gave this movie enough appeal so that I can recommend it.\n",
      "Everything old is new again I just came from seeing STAR WARS VII! Before I get started, I'd just like to point out that I have never seen a movie with as much hype behind it in my life! Disney has really pulled out all the stops and spared no expense in stoking the flames of this release. With all the merchandising and third party tie in's from makeup to jewelry to breakfast cereal to (no lie) oranges, this movie is set up to possibly be the biggest movie of all time! As a matter of fact, it's so set itself up that if it's anything less than that some will look at it as a failure. Directed by Hollywood powerhouse J.J. Abrams, the director of the Star Trek reboot, this new Star Wars movie seeks to blow more wind into the sails of the biggest film franchise of all time and wash the taste of the ill fated prequels from the mouths of Star Wars fans everywhere. So what does that mean for you, John and Jane Q. Movie-goer? Well, it typically means one of two things, either it is in fact the greatest movie ever made or it's a rotten piece of garbage that the studio is hoping for big numbers for in the first few weeks before people realize that it stinks on ice. Well folks, I've just come from the theater and I have to say that without a doubt, Star Wars delivers! Just to give you a bit of a background, the last time we we heard about the saga going on in a galaxy far, far away, Luke Skywalker and the Rebel Alliance had just defeated Darth Vader the evil Emperor Palpatine. The story in Star Wars VII takes place some 25 years after the defeat of the Galactic Empire where out of the ashes of the now defunct empire a new evil has emerged in the form of The First Order, an oppressive force bent on destroying Luke Skywalker and his group of Jedi Knights who have since gone into hiding. At the same time a faction of the Rebel Alliance known as The Resistance seeks to find Luke and fight The First Order. This story is centered around The characters Rey and Finn, two misfits, played by relative Hollywood newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega and their journey to help The Resistance find Luke Skywalker at any cost. I'd love to tell more, but given the nature of this film, it's best to leave the details of the plot alone. Let's just say that they, along with Oscar Issac, who plays the hot shot X-Wing pilot Poe, do a great job of breathing some much needed new life into this franchise. At the same time, Domhnall Gleeson, Adam Driver and Andy Circus are famously evil as the quasi-Nazi First Order. This movie is not all new blood however, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and all your favorite Star Wars heroes like Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 make appearances here and they work well to provide balance between the old and the new in the film. The special effects are fantastic, the action scenes are crisp and well choreographed and the story is thrilling, fast paced and immersive, with equal parts old and new Star Wars, bringing in new characters and new stories while at the same time taking quite a few cues from the original Star Wars which for me ended up being both heart warming and a little disappointing seeing as the familiar parts begin to give the movie a bit of the Ghostbusters 2 syndrome in that a few too many of the same notes from the old series are hit. All in all, I really really liked this movie and it's faults are all but crushed by it's hundreds of positives from funny script writing to thrilling visuals to the pure rush I got from seeing some of the old characters back together. I am definitely looking forward to seeing this movie at least another 2 times in the theater. Star Wars: The Force Awakens get a 4.5... out of 5.\n",
      "The Good, The Bad, &amp; The Ugly NOTE: I watched this film with an abject disdain. As a result I wasn't nearly as bitter by the time the film concluded. I've since rewatched it twice to get a better handle on how to rate it. I was born in the Time Gap between the Trilogy and the Prequels so I was very hyper-analytical when I watched this because I felt (And still feel) that the Prequels were an abomination where George Lucas attempted to cash in on the Trilogies iconic status. This is as unbiased a review as I can possibly produce. Here's the breakdown. Visuals: 8.1 (It was fine. It was space &amp; planets that looked like space &amp; planets)  Effects: 7.4 (Some of the CGI was still a little too out-of-place, but not awful)  Script &amp; Writing: 7.2 (It was better than the Lucas Prequels, so...yeah)  Sound &amp; Music: 8.1 (It's Star Wars. Give John Williams a baton or emulate him in every conceivable fashion &amp; you win)  Acting: 7.3 (It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but could have been better)  Directing: 7.6 (It was a fair approach that tried to honor the Trilogy)  Overall Rating: 7.6 (Fair to Decent) Whether you like this movie or do not will be entirely subjective to what you'd expect and hope it to be. I honestly cannot tell you whether or not you'll love it or hate it. I think how you approach it may ease the transition into it. As far as anyone's statements about PC-Star Wars or what not, I do disagree with that. I think the new actors did alright. They had an admittedly difficult set of shoes to fill. I'm obliged to maintain a spoiler free atmosphere with my reviews so I won't get into anything deeper than that. The returning cast did their jobs. The problem to me isn't that this movie was good or bad or ugly, the problem is the Ghostbusters-factor. After a certain amount of time has passed it gradually becomes impossible to produce a film, series, or variation of such based on an original film, series, or variation that will hold up to the standards of the fanbase. Is this film for kids? Probably not toddlers but yeah I'd say while some of the scenes have more aggressive tones older kids and younger teens could probably handle it fine. It depends on your child really. Will fans of the Trilogy like it? Depends on the fan and how they approach, along with their expectations upon entering. I didn't hate it. I didn't love it. It was fair to decent, parts were good, parts were meh, and parts were bad. Eye of the Beholder film for sure.\n",
      "It's Star Wars for new generation. That's what I told the guy sitting next to me in the theatre in South San Francisco off of 280 when he and I exchanged some thoughts on the then new Star Wars film. It was fun to see, but Disney's film is handicapped by the following; this film didn't come on the heels of 30+ years of ultra- serious dramas or very corny musicals, where sci-fi was a thing given to kiddies or the \"brainiacs\" or \"nerds\" who liked to engage in technical and scientific things, but who didn't date much (note the sexual undercurrent in a lot of sci-fi from the 50s and 60s). Star Wars, the original 1977 feature film, had that benefit. There was 2001 Space Odyssey, Logan's Run the year before with its awful miniatures, and the Star Trek TV series that had been canceled a few years before, but effects technology at the time was more miss than hit, and the genre itself, other than classic Star Trek, really wasn't taken all that seriously. So when Star Wars hit the screen people were blown away by it. The Force Awakens, or more specifically the people who made it, know they can't repeat those conditions that gave the 1977 film that \"wow effect\", so it steers more towards a graphic-novel like presentation, complete with emotional intrigue among the characters to try and compliment that large SFX wizardry that's presented on screen. But that's kind of the draw back to The Force Awakens. It's a victim of its own circumstances where we have lots of effects heavy films in the Superhero genre and other tangential scifi sub-genres already tumbling out of Hollwood studios, one after the other. Therefore any visual bedazzlement from The Force Awakens needs to be fairly spectacular to compete with and against the other films. Do we get that? In some respect. The effects are impressive, but the story elements they're meant to accentuate, at times, seem a bit odd. Storywise there's a real attempt to re-invent the basic story for the whole saga, taking some cues from graphic-novel story conventions. Which in turn gives the film a very 2000's kind of look and feel. The visual presentation and interweaving romantic- tension subplots is a very post 80's story telling style, of which I am not a fan. It is my opinion that the story is the story. A romance or sexual tension can be part of that story, but today is meant to run parallel to the main-story as a backdrop thread to appease those who have interests in such matters. The final summation implies that the romance is just as important as needing to defeat the bad guys or overcome the harrowing situation. And, to be brutally honest, both men and women know that that is not true in any situation where this is the setting. And ultimately this is why I liked the film as a Sunday afternoon kind of affair; couch, summer-Sunday, window open, maybe the fan running slightly in the background, maybe your dog sleeping next to you or in a cool spot of the house, and you have this thing on at a low volume as you lay back and watch it with nothing else to do. To me that's the kind of movie this is. It lacks grit, uses conventional modern Disney story telling styles to recirculate the death star plot from the 1977 feature film. And where 1977's film prepared my generation for social and personal challenges in a world that would increasingly rely on tech, this film posits more romantic and interpersonal preparation for a multi- ethnic world. To me that message is many days late and several dollars short. The exit of a major character, the under-exposition of classic characters, a reliance on a plot already used, doesn't really add up to neither an outstanding nor poor film experience, but one that just happens to be. It's almost like a social commentary on what already is, and a warning against the regurgitation of past ideologies.  My last observation is that this is aimed at the teen-aged children of the teenagers and pre-teens who saw the film way back in 1977. Which I think makes for an odd film making and directorial style, because we're not exposed to classic film making here, but someone's idea of what today's teens want to see. That includes that exit of a major character, which seemed hammy and nearly anti-climactic; i.e. no \"disturbances in the force\" was felt because of this. A dramatic moment that felt like a real over the top story point that had no emotional impact, as it should have.  I guess the best one could say is that if Disney had produced Star Wars, then this is the result we would get. I think that's the fairest statement anyone can make, and all that it implies. Watch at your risk, but maybe relax while doing so.\n",
      "Love Star Wars First of all, I love Star Wars series because it is not SF, but it describes the family relation and the problem of virtue and evil. The background is imaginary, but we have the same problem as its core theme. In Star Wars episode VII , many people discuss mainly \"who is Ray? \" And I think she describes the figure of every girls live this modern society. She is asked \" Who are you?\"by everyone, and also ask herself the same way. She cannot sure her identity, but she has strong mental power to live through life. This implies the way girls live their life . Moreover, Kylo Ren's inner weakness suggests human's weakness. His appearance seems to be very strong and evil, however, his true figure is very fragile. He cannot establish his existence and seems to have bemusement about which he belongs, \"virtue or evil?\". Such conflict often occurs when we live life. Anyway, I cannot wait the sequel.\n",
      "Okay Storyline... I think the main reason we all saw the movie was Luke Skywalker, who doesn't show up until the end of the movie...That was not the only thing, the story line to it was a little dull if you ask me. All in all the move was good. But with all that being said it was a pretty good movie with everything a movie needs. Twists in the plot such as Han Solo murdered by Kylo Ren (His Son) was a nice twist in the story, though me and my family are huge Han Solo fans it was a nice twist to the story I have to admit. If a little more effort was put into it I think it would've been a lot better. I would say I recommend this movie to people but it is out of theateres, so you should buy it on DVD if you have not seen it yet.\n",
      "Won This Guy Over So I'm not into big blockbuster movies normally. I prefer more cerebral, laboured, art-house indie films. I find the constant overwhelming spectacle of noise, explosions, and unrealistic worlds which derive from spinoffs of pre-existing lore, mythology, and legends exhausting and cardboard-thin. However with this iteration of Star Wars, and I don't know why the others, including the classics, never had that effect on me, it feels like there's an air of magic, and childhood wonder wrapped into it. Perhaps I'm wrong, but what I got a sense of is that every actor, creative, and person on set had a childhood reverence and excitement in them when it came to making this movie. And it doesn't matter that you will be staring at odd looking aliens, or seeing humans interact with machines in implausible ways, or that people's names, or that of planets, are sometimes outright ridiculous. It matters that, 3 minutes in, you just don't care, and end up watching the whole thing with a smile 3 miles wide. Awesome.\n",
      "Great for Star Wars fans.. \"Meh\" for film fans So what did I think of the next chapter in Star Wars? To be honest, yes, the Star Wars geek in me was yelling in excitement on the inside. I actually did tear up a little when the scrolling credits started up. So as a fan, I loved it. It has been far too long that I have been wanting to know the next story but lets be critical shall we? I was not blown away by this film as many fans (including myself) was expecting to be. I found the story a little predictable at times and cliché. I found the comedy within the movie far too Disney-esque. Something I would expect and welcome in a Marvel movie because that is what I love coming out of my favorite super heroes mouth's but Star Wars? Not so much. Also, as a Star Wars fan I was upset with the lack of light saber action. On the other end though, I enjoyed the action sequences as a whole. From the ground combat to the dogfights in the sky; Star Wars delivered and it was quite epic. The returning faces were great to see as well in their respective scenes. So again, as a whole the film brought the pain and I enjoyed the majority of it. I have waited a long time for this as a fan and it fulfilled the void in my heart for a good Star Wars film. I hope for the next installment that there is much more force and light sabers. So here's to waiting a couple years for the next one to come.\n",
      "The $2 Billion Reboot Episode VII in the \"Star Wars\" saga serves to reunite some of our favorite characters (and actors) from the very first film of 1977. Harrison Ford is back as Han Solo, as is Carrie Fisher as the Princess Leia Organa. Mark Hamill has a cameo appearance as Luke Skywalker. There are also three great new characters joining the resistance movement against the formidable First Order. They include a dynamic performance by Daisy Rider as Rey, John Boyega as Finn, and Oscar Isaac as the pilot Poe Dameron. R2-D2, C-CPO, and Chewie Chewbaca are also back! The plot of \"The Force Awakens\" is a virtual cookie cutter from the original \"Star Wars\" film with the same stages of the hero's journey. More than any other character, the central hero is the character of Rey, as she discovers the force within her to the overcome adversity of The First Order. The most dramatic scene in the film is a tension-packed meeting of father and son when Han Solo confronts his son on a bridge. Adam Driver turns in a good performance as the son, Kylo Ren, who has gone over to the other side. The meeting of father and son has Oedipal connotations exactly like the relationship of Luke and Darth Vader. For 135 minutes, this \"Star Wars\" film has plenty of action and lively moments, the best of which involve the sly and sassy remarks of Han Solo. Not to be missed!\n",
      "Not Much New Here The story is a rehash of all the episodes that went before with some exception: the Bad Guys are now called The First Order led by the Supreme Leader Snoke played by Andy Serkis. The main premise centers on finding Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) so that he cannot lead a rebellion against the First Order. Luke had gone into seclusion. The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the CGI which is again spectacular. Nothing is really new except for the young scavenger girl Rey played by Daisy Ridley and she is pretty and a breath of fresh air in a series that truly needs it.  Of course, the First Order has a weapon that uses the power of the sun to destroy the Republic led by General/Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). The main fallacy here is that had the First Order used the weapon and destroyed the Republic and didn't concentrate on finding Luke, well, that would have been that and end of story. But they didn't and well, you know the good guys -- ( Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) -- will find a way to destroy the First Order. Hey, it's in the script. (You waited on that one, eh?) There are some almost good lines between Han Solo and Chewbacca and sometimes Rey. Han Solo does comment on Princess Leia's hair (he likes it this way) that was atrocious in previous Star Wars movies. We learn that the General under Supreme Leader Snoke is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who happens to be the son of Han Solo and Princess Leia. Who knew? (I believe you fell asleep in previous stories) Yes, that is true, the never ending battles and explosions all over the galaxy have that tendency to put me into la la land. This time the battles didn't last as long and that was a good thing. Something that was disappointing was the voice of General Kylo Ren. We expected it to be more along the lines of Darth Vader back in the day. But he sounded more like a Brooklynite who happened to be in charge of Storm Troopers in the First Order. (yes, we expected something more commanding along Darth Vader's voice especially with the Mask on.) One other thing that may or may not be true, but sometimes I had the feeling that some conversations were dubbed. Could have been just me, but",
      "",
      "",
      " If one had never seen previous Star Wars movies this movie will be excellent and quite enjoyable, but for others we saw a rehash of previous versions, nothing really new and it's just the same with the good guys going after the bad guys that included spectacular CGI to include outstanding cinematography. (7/10) Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.\n",
      "I must the the only one to like it? OK, this is my opinion of the new Star Wars. It was a bit like a remake, but not. I wouldn't consider it a bad movie, or whatever the negative posters have been saying. I did expect better, but it was still a good movie regardless. Was cool seeing what we can do with modern technology, and was great seeing the old greats again. Great actors, except the dude that played the main badguy, just don't like that dude AT ALL.... Stupid looking, GIANT FACE with TERRIBLE acting..  Everyone else was good. Seemed like they remade the original, but added parts from others, but then changed things as well.  Was it a waste of time and money? No, not at all.. I'm happy I watched it, and excited and eager for the next one coming out in 2017. Now here comes the spoiler.. If you haven't seen it yet, STOP READING NOW!!! Seeing the Falcon was awesome.. Seeing Chewy was awesome, but he was thinner. Seeing C3p0, and R2 was awesome.. Seeing Han Solo made me happy as all heck.. Seeing Han get killed made me so upset! All in all, it was a good movie, I expected better, and more action, but I am still glad to have seen it.\n",
      "A reboot? Maybe not that much Star Wars is a saga that I deeply cherish, it had been following me since I was 5 years old and I still am a big fan of it. You can't imagine the excitement when I heard they were going to make a new film soon, something I literally had dreams about. I will say, I think the 3 prequels could have been much better. But onto the new installment: The force awakens. Poe Dameron (Oscar Issac), the best pilot in the resistance, was charged to find a map to locate Luke Skywalker. As the first order attacks, Poe charges the little ball droid BB-8 with the burden. Poe gets captured and BB-8 is sent roaming alone in the desert planet of Jakku. Let's begin with the main fault people find to this movie: \"It looks too much like A New Hope\". Yes, it has similar plot points, and I almost didn't care. Because what people seem to forget is what new stuff it brings to the table. In a new hope, I don't remember a Stormtrooper, Finn (John Boyega), deserting the imperial ranks. Vader was cool, but he never was as deep as kylo ren (Adam Driver) in the movie. I don't recall the owner of the mos eisley cantina being a 900 years old almost mystical creature. The point is, the new characters, especially Rey (Daisy Ridley) will make you forget about that critic, it has similar plot point, but I found myself not caring that much.  This movie is simple enough, but still complex. It has a basic story; a no-name woman gets the help of a few people to defeat an evil force. And like in the previous star wars movies, it works. I found it fun to have a movie that I could just enjoy and shrink down to being a kid.  Unlike the prequels, the characters seem real; they are 3 dimensional and relatable and likable. Except for one which is a little bit too much powerful, but I suppose the next films will explain some of that. Kylo Ren was a personal favorite, I have a weakness for psychotic and tormented characters, and I just can't explain it. Kylo's frequent outbursts, his inferiority complex and his fears, made him a very interesting character. Dialogues felt real and true to the characters, from Finn's clumsiness and Rey's innocence, to Poe's cockiness.  The special effects are top, there's a very good mix of practical (thank god) and CGI and everything looked real. I really loved the actions scenes, never cutting to explosions Michael bay style; JJ Abram knew how to direct our attention towards the actors while the action was unfolding around them. The cinematography was lovely. I don't know if you ever noticed in the prequels, but the shots were really boring and repetitive. But none of that here, it's much more creative. The lighting is hard to talk about, but in one scene, it mirrors the light work in the duel of episode VI and I loved it, it added a lot to the emotional factor. The soundtrack wasn't my personal favorite of the six, but was still great, just not as memorable.  It had a few problems, starkiller base (which I don't want to talk about for spoiler reasons) and one scene in particular which had too much CGI for my taste. The similarity to episode IV might annoy some people but I didn't find them distracting at all.  Go see it if you want a fun time, if you want to see fun action, likable characters and a generally good adventure movie. If someone tells you it sucked, listen to what they had to say, ask a review from them",
      "they'll probably tell you about the similarities with ANH and a certain Mary Sue. But it was a wonderful experience, a dream come true for a fan like me",
      "I saw it 5 times. What's wrong with me?\n",
      "JJ Did It! JJ Abrams nailed it. The movie had extremely high expectations. Considering the hype, I would say I was satisfied. The visuals were very well done and did not make your head spin (like most high speed CG movies today). Daisy and Boyega performed very well and I look forward to their performance in next installment of the franchise. But the best part to me was the background score. It really evoked the feeling of pure joy that the prequels could not. Watch the trailer again after seeing the film and you will be amazed at how cleverly they managed to keep the film under the wraps. Great end to a stellar year Hollywood. Good on you.\n",
      "\"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" is ultimately a collection of counterparts and equivalents. Thirty years after the defeat of Emperor Palpatine and the Galactic Empire, a new threat has arisen to once again bring terror and destruction to the galaxy. The self-proclaimed \"First Order\" military force, led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and the mysterious Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), strategically conspires to attack the Republic to regain their former glory. But when conflicted stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) disobeys his murderous orders to instead aid in the escape of Resistance fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), he sets in motion a cataclysmic battle between good and evil that will bring him face to face with a pretty scavenger (Daisy Ridley), a vicious Dark Jedi, and a legendary duo from the past. It's just not quite the same without the Twentieth Century Fox fanfare prior to the now unmistakable line, \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away",
      "\" Nevertheless, John Williams' thunderous theme music and the yellow scrolling text instantly put the viewer back into that nostalgic territory of what George Lucas started back in 1977. This new chapter is, in large part, an attempt to undo what Lucas then did to the franchise with his staggeringly mediocre prequel trilogy, which itself felt like an opportunistic endeavor rather than a passionate work of art. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" is ultimately a collection of counterparts and equivalents. The more the filmmakers attempt to recreate the substance of the original three pictures, the more it negates its own reason for existence. To its credit, most of the imagery and sound effects and character designs do possess an aura of authenticity when compared directly to the former vision (almost as if this project commenced around 1986, keeping up with the three-year gaps). But in sticking to so many familiar elements, the project forgot to craft its own identity; it's unmistakably reminiscent of a remake. From the blaster fire, to the massive Star Destroyers crossing star-speckled skies, to the rubbery alien faces populating desert communities, to the black-cloaked villain stepping from his transport, to the droids rolling and chirping about, so much of this undertaking is recycled. Director J.J. Abrams would insist that all of the similarities are nods or homage, but by the time the heavily-secreted plot is revealed, it's entirely obvious that no new story is awaiting to unfold. Damsels in distress, familial betrayals, roguish pilots engaging in daredevil maneuvers, planet-destroying weapons, good versus evil, and vastly outnumbered rebels proposing speculative plans to blow things up, all return in spades, but without the inspiration needed to demonstrate something novel or impactful. However, a dash of blood here and there appears generally unconventional. \"I've got a bad feeling about this.\" The dialogue also conforms to the mood and tone of the '77 classic, plucking snippets from the prior six episodes to such a great degree that it's possible the whole screenplay does not contain a single line of fresh material. And the storyline once again starts in the middle of a middle (not unlike \"The Empire Strikes Back\"), recognizing that, certainly not serving as a standalone entry, this enterprise will be best appreciated by longtime fans. It's also under the impression that audiences require constant action, as it creates a static level of nonstop tumult in which no single sequence has the chance to stand out. But in the end, though it may have lost a good portion of the magic, every so often, when an iconic component or character makes a grandiose appearance (and there are plenty of notable arrivals), it's difficult not to revel in the experience of witnessing a familiar cast wield the Force and do battle against the Dark Side - the right way and for the first time in over 30 years.  The Massie Twins \n",
      "A (near) perfect synthesis of old and new. This FEELS like Star Wars! This movie hits every conceivable emotion, but above all, it's fun. Nowadays, we have so much dark gritty stuff which is great and deep, but it gets tiring. And, things that try to be fun come off as overly silly and dumbed down. The Force Awakens does something not many films have done successfully in a while; combine the two seamlessly into one balanced package. The prequels tried to do this, and it blew up in Lucas' face. The reason it works in this movie is that all the humour and drama comes naturally from the characters. Yes, the plot and beats are VERY similar to A New Hope, but that was a great movie. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Besides, that's exactly what's been missing from movies lately. So don't listen to all these negative reviewers saying \"it's a remake\", or a \"rip-off\". Towards the end, it goes completely its own way becoming more like The Empire Strikes Back. Let's start with the characters. It's great to see the old characters back in action. The Han and Leia scenes could have easily felt like they were just in there for nostalgia factor, but they feel natural and factor into the plot. Given the vast number of characters, it's amazing how very few of them feel shoe-horned in. There are three that I can think of who did, but all three of them are confirmed to be in the next one, so I'll get my fix then. However, the real standouts are the new characters. Adam Driver brings unexpected depth to Kylo Ren. Oscar Isaac is intensely likable as Poe Dameron. John Boyega is great as Finn. But the best is Daisy Ridley as Rey. She is going to be in so much more stuff, I guarantee. The chemistry between her and Finn was one of my favourite parts of the movie. The cinematography is incredible. The camera never moved around in the originals. Here, it follows around the action, capturing the feeling of playing with toys as a kid more perfectly than any movie before. It also just feels so much like Star Wars. Every sound and image is familiar. The movie has a real presence; the practical effects make it feel real. John Williams' new score is great, of course. He does a great job integrating the old with the new. In fact, that would be my summary of the movie. It pays enough homage to the original while setting up an exciting new story. I like how not everything is revealed by the end of this film. The final shot perfectly sums up all the questions we are left with and foreshadows what to come. It may be one of my favourite final shots of a movie ever. In conclusion, some people are going to hate on it for being too much like the originals, others are going to complain that it's not enough like them. Some will say too many questions were answered, others will say that not enough were. In the end, there are so many expectations riding on this film that it will never live up to everyone's hype. It's a minor miracle what JJ did. He had to bring in all of the old, set up a sprawling galaxy of new, establish what's been going on for 30 years between films, add humour, add drama, and somehow make it cohesive and fun. If you go in with the understanding that this is a movie, not the second coming, you will leave immensely satisfied.\n",
      "amazing return to the star wars universe We've waited.... and waited..... and here it is! The Force Awakens is everything we've come to love about Star Wars. It's big, it's epic, it's spectacular. And underneath, there's actually a big heart to it all. You get a sense from watching it, that it was made by true fans of the series. I won't give away any real spoilers- but rest assured Jar Jar Binks does not put in an appearance, so remain calm.  The good guys are very likable, I thought the relationship between Ray and Finn worked out very well. It gave the film it's emotional anchor.  The villains are pretty much what you would expect, but the filmmakers threw in a few twists about them that were interesting.  Add some terrific battle sequences, and you get a very welcome return to the greatness of Star Wars. Go and see it (but you already know you will). Take a friend or a family member. You'll have a great time. Because that's what these films are about when it comes down to it.  Overall, Force Awakens shows off some snazzy visual effects combined with a compelling story and great characters. It won't disappoint.\n",
      "mediocre Well, the first part of the movie is about ... the main protagonists meeting and then separating and meeting again. It really has this Harry Potter taste to it. It makes you want to feel that these characters are connected, but if they are it doesn't happen in this movie. The other part consists of pretty shots of dead spaceships in da desert and some terribly plastic epic moments of returning actors.  Which brings to the next point and it must be said; were dropped 30 years in the future with no clue as to what happened and no explanation of the current situation. Leia just appears almost solely to reinforce the feeling of continuation between the new and old cast, but we don't know anything of what she did in the last 30 years. Even worst for the antagonists. The 'new emperor' is a giant alien being with a terrible scar on his face. No explanation on who he is or how he got there. totally random. As for his apprentice, or the main villein for this movie he might as well be called Darth Malfoy or Darth Twilight. He is somewhat fragile, week, needy and maybe just a tad creepy and sneaky but that is really all that Adam Driver has to say in the movie. more on him later. Perhaps the worst part is the second half of the movie. At first, when they discuss their mission in the command room in the typical star wars pre battle briefing, I thought it was actually a joke. But no, they really have to destroy the deathstar, again, only this time its 10 times bigger. thats it. So basically the plot is harry potter meets a new hope. Going back to the antagonists, (because lets say it, the traitor stormtrooper, the lady skywalker and the ace pilot aren't particularly extravagant tropes) the big bad giant without a name, of a never seen before race whose rise to power has no explanation is just really a mass of pixels with 2 or 3 lines in the movie. His apprentice? is just a pig puzzle of... indecision. His attempt to seduce Rey to the dark side is.. laughable... and out of the blue.. just felt like it was added to the dialogue 'cos thats what star wars is'.  This movie is a mess, and the stunts were better in the later 3 episodes by Lucas. Not to mention, Most of the locations of this movie are real places on earth. Sand, Snow, and Iceland type islands. So much for the space opera.  Last but not least. Someone said this movie was witty... he's being paid to say so... It had none of the good humor some of the recent Disney movies had (lone ranger - john carter) the jokes and I laughed one or two times during the whole pic. The audience seemed to agree with me, no one was particularly exited on their way out, sure, it was almost 3 am Finally, the plot twist in the movie is ... 1) you know its coming 5 minutes before it happens. 2) It feels like they just did it to a) not have to deal with him anymore b) cos he wanted it since episode 5 c) to make a similarity with Obi One's death from a new hope (as if they alrady didn't take enough of that movies plot into this one..) BAH!...\n",
      "Felt like a Star Wars movie, But left me with a sense of disappointment *Spoilers* For months I've this movie has been hyped up, and as I stood in a queue that looked like it had neither a beginning nor end, I was buzzing with excitement like every other person in the queue. When STAR WARS flashed across the screen with the accompanying music that is universally known, I settled myself in for what was sure to be the best Star Wars movie yet....right? While the movie itself was very good, hence the 7/10 rating, there was something amiss. Everything was going great at the start, you're introduced to these fresh new characters that you know nothing about, but you're eager to learn everything about them, and by the time the movie finished, you knew that one of these would be your favorite, that you would emotionally connect with that character more than any other. But by the end of the movie, the only new character I can say that I felt the slightest bit emotionally connected to was BB-8. it had nothing to do with with the acting, which was actually rather good (with the exception of a certain princess/general and at times, kylo ren). no, the issue was you didn't know enough about the characters to feel emotionally invested in them. you get very little back-story on our new heroes/villains, and when you do, it is generally quite vague, I guess it helps the movie move a little faster, but would it hurt to sit the characters down for 5 minutes or so and actually explain to us who these characters really are? But they're saving that for the next movie some people might say, well that's fair enough, but I hope to god that it's worth waiting 2 years for. and lets not even start on characters that were probably just thrown in so Disney could put a name to the toy cough*Phasma*cough. The plot seemed awfully familiar (a new hope anyone?) and there were certain things that annoyed the s*** out of me. for example, the storm trooper that decided to desert, and now all of a sudden he can shoot straight, and he's able to go one on one with a reasonably trained sith for a good 5 minutes or so (regular storm trooper would last 5 seconds). and lets not mention the fact that rey suddenly turned into a jedi master, with no yoda. *major spoiler* I think the worst part for me was the death of Han Solo, I thought it was brilliant that he was killed off, don't get me wrong, I love the guy, but it's that shock factor and urge to cry that makes it so brilliant, if Finn had been killed, people probably wouldn't have been that bothered. No, the part that bothered me so much, was when Rey, Chewie and Finn returned to the resistance base, Leia sought solace over the loss of Han (she did't look too bothered tbh) with Rey, someone she has barely known for 5 minutes, while Chewie is left to mourn the loss of his best friend of more than 30 years on his own, not even a pat on the head for the guy, I mean come on. and where was the funeral? a last dignified goodbye for the guy we've wanted to be since we were kids. Vader got one, even Qui-gon got one. \"He might still be alive\" some might say. don't be so stupid, the guys in his 60's for crying out loud. he got impaled and got thrown overboard emperor style. falling down the last couple of stairs would have finished him off. To conclude, as much as I've ripped on it, it was still a very enjoyable movie. would I watch it again? yes. would i watch it dozens of times like previous star wars? probably not. Rant over\n",
      "Star Wars Awakens After thinking about the films for several hours after seeing it, and being initially disappointed. I can say that Star Wars the Force Awakens is well crafted film that captures the spirit of the original trilogy very well. The new cast members all perform well and create a new set of heroes and villains. Older cast members are also great especially Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Daisy Ridley as Rey. The film moves along at pace, similar to the first Star Wars film and is essentially a chase movie for the first hour of its run time. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is an interesting villain, which has conflicting issues to deal with, and is quite a nut case that has hissy fits. My main gripe with the film is the plot line of the Starkiller base, being too similar to the death star of the original trilogy. There was really no need for this plot line, just having Kylo Ren looking for Luke Skywalker was enough. Also would the rebellion not of known about the creation of such a base well before its construction? I also feel that Luke Skywalker would not abandon His truest friends, I do understand there is a lot gone on since Return of the Jedi that could of driven a wedge between their friendships. Luke however would of sensed what was going on with signals in the force and surely of helped, I feel his appearance was purely to set up the next film. Although the resistance claims victory it feels like a subdued win because of events of the attack on the Star killer base. The action is well filmed and the lightsaber battles are raw and feel dangerous. Overall this is a good film and a return to the film making beats of the original trilogy. It had unachievable hype to live up too, but the mix of old and new bond well, it is exciting to see what happens next in the Star Wars Saga....\n",
      "This movie awakens that good ol' feeling Finally there is a new Star Wars movie. This movie is easy to sum up without spoiling it. It is a roller-coaster ride throughout the whole movie. And yes, there are (a lot) of elements that summon a déjà vu. But those elements made us fall in love with Star Wars in the first place and once again it made me fall in love with \"The Force Awakens\". I saw it yesterday in IMAX and I am still shaking. This is my first review because I owe it to JJ. I just want to let people know to go and watch this. And form your own opinion! Don't let negative people influence your judgment...Pessimism is a path to the dark side. Stay true and may the Force be with you.\n",
      "It's Our Fault, We Asked For This! After 10 years - or 32, depending on your regard for the legitimacy of the prequel trilogy - Star Wars is back, and, in the spirit of times, as Giuseppe DI Lampedusa would have put it, it was necessary for everything to change in order for it to remain the same: new studio, new team, new characters... new expanded universe even (more on that later). It's funny then, and sadly not at all surprising, that so many things remain the same as in 1977. The Empire has survived, in the form the The First Order, and the rebellion is now the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa. A soul-searching stormtrooper (Boyega) saves ace resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Isaac) and important info stored in a droid and stages an escape to a desolate desert planet... Well, if echoes of Episode IV are already a bit startling, it gets worse. It quickly becomes clear why so many directors turned down this dream assignment, as Episode VII isn't as much a chance to play in George Lucas' sandbox as a remake of his original opus. Blame Disney. Blame J. J. Abrahms, he's certainly done this before... the fault, it turns out, is yours. After the dismal prequels, chock-block of new ideas, some good, some bad, most of them executed horribly, we've howled for movies that resembled the originals more that Disney would have been suicidal to approve anything more original than this, and history will judge Episode VII on how much it emboldens the studio to be more daring, or whether it just confirms the need to just \"give fans what they want\", more of the same. Time will tell, but, to quote our heroes, I have a bad feeling about this. What is annoying this time, after the utter cluelessness of Episodes I-III, is the very real talent on display here. The old characters could have stood silently in the background, paychecks safely cashed, but they make a mark, particularly Harrison Ford as Solo, more touching and involved here than he has been for at least a decade. The new characters are just as involving and appealing, particularly John Boyega's Finn and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. Andy Serkis also makes an impression. Otherwise, the humor is back and it's a thrill to see J.J. Abrams work a scene after the inane telenovela-like blocking of the prequels. And still, this could have been much more, and our only consolation will have to be that it could have also been worse. The greatest question is, what comes next? Tonally, we are squarely back in original trilogy mode, the only limit will be the appeal of the characters (mostly successful here) and the caliber of the stories (not so much). It is a bit worrying that Disney has jettisoned all the expanded universe, both because it might set an ugly precedent, and because it does show a fear of risk and cynical approach to a very valuable brand.  And yet... we might be wrong: what little transparency has been displayed so far might be completely honest. It was George Lucas himself who, in an interview, said Disney had rejected all his outlines saying that they wanted to make \"one for the fans\". Well, this describes Episode VII perfectly. If we could have some fresh ideas with our next helping, we'd truly be thrilled.\n",
      "Don't listen to the haters! It's a shame to see so many people complaining about how similar this was to episode IV and how it feels simply like a reboot. Maybe there are points where the homage becomes extreme, but it still ticks almost all the boxes of a movie-goer. The film itself looks and feels amazing, with all the touches of old, including numerous new and old aliens lurking in the background to give it that classic star wars universe feel. Obviously as in any film there are ways you could pick at it, maybe the humour is excessive? Maybe it could be more original? But at the end of the day it will leave you laughing, crying and cheering, all in good measure. Star Wars is back with a bang, and episode VII makes it feel like it's never really been gone.\n",
      "Boycott the new Star Wars movie! I've never asked for my money back for any movie in my life until know! Without ruining the movie for anyone... the main start is a female Jedi (Rey) which had her usually passive aggressive attitude towards all men (Feminist behaviour) and \"I can look after myself.\" I was going to walk out until Harrison Ford made an entrance and played his alpha self. Of course Rey comes along and tells Harrison Ford how to run his ship for him! You can see him wanting to tell her to shut the %@#$ up but her pulls out his Feminist agenda card cause he doesn't want to be ridiculed by the Galaxy media and lose his job! The bad guy was great for only 5 mins but after running into Rey he turns into a major beta just like the storm trooper Finn. I was a star wars fan until now! Everything that was star wars is in my bin now! If you want to see a bullshit \"woman in power\" and all men bowing down to her, go see the new Star Wars!\n",
      "Something, something, something, dark side. Something, something, something, complete",
      " It's as if millions of Star Wars fans suddenly cried out in criticism and were suddenly silenced – as that's the effect this movie should have on most (other than those fanatics who were bound to be disappointed/hate it no matter what). For all the SANE Star Wars fans out there, I'm happy to report that the Force is strong with this series once again (after taking a walk on the dark side with the prequels). All other shoddy imitations take note – THIS is how you do a space opera. The Force Awakens possesses everything that was missing from the soulless prequels – we have a non-snooze-worthy storyline, likable new characters, great acting, non-cringe-worthy dialogue and not such a reliance on only CGI effects/green-screen. The pluses of this movie are in abundance, starting with what's new. All those with reservations about the fresh young actors cast to play new characters Rey and Finn should sit back, relax and watch the beautiful chemistry between the two as their characters form a friendship/dynamic on screen (which they also seem to share off- screen) that rivals that of the original trio. Daisy Ridley more than proves she's up to the challenge of letting a large portion of the new trilogy rest on her shoulders. Her Rey is a scavenger with a good heart (as evidenced by her coming to the rescue of BB-8, a droid carrying something important on him). Whilst certain people (who for some unfathomable reason don't like seeing a woman who can handle herself) may take this new female lead (who is smart, brave, kind and just all around awesome) as a personal affront to them, for the rest of us who *don't* hate seeing a woman take centre stage, this is what we've been looking for in a female character for so long. She's everything you could hope for...but not without her faults, as she does make occasional mistakes – but not enough you hate her for it. She's flawed, but SO much more interesting because of this. Ridley imbues her character with so much heart and soul, conveys a lot with just looks and even shows she's adept at humour as well. Most importantly, she's likable, forming instant friendship with other characters who we already like (so we know she's awesome). Any gripes about her would be for petty reasons/nitpick-y. Sharing her responsibility of being one of the new faces of this trilogy is John Boyega as Finn – a former Stormtooper who refuses to go along with the rest when he witnesses them do something terrible. It's after this that he meets Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron, who he forms an almost-immediate friendship with. Out of the three new leads, Isaac's Poe is probably given the least development, but he manages to make it believable that he and Finn become close friends in such a short space of time. The best dynamic, though, is without a doubt the one formed between Rey and Finn. The way they play off each other with such ease is thanks in large parts to the actors, but also the dialogue is snappy and quick-witted. They share a fun friendship that becomes quite close, but is always believable due to the actors truly inhabiting their roles/believing in who they're playing as well as the universe they're a part of (where characters talk/act in a unique way). One of many things the prequels sadly lacked was heart, but this movie/these characters have it in spades. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren picks up where Darth Vader left off as our main villain this time around and is clearly devoted to his memory (since he talks to the burnt mask of him, as seen in the trailers). Driver is quite good at playing the bad guy, though he is prone to the occasional 'hissy fit' with his crossguard lightsaber which verges into slightly over-the-top/petulant teenager behavior. Thankfully, when the big moments occur, Driver shows real emotion/conflict within his character. His lightsaber duel, first with Finn and then Rey, is everything the prequel duels were lacking. They may've had the needless fancy twirling and whatnot, but here we have rough and tumble, gritty fights between someone skilled and two people who are only just learning what they're capable of. Plus there's real emotional investment, which helps. It's an epic battle with tension – which is a BIG plus with this movie: we don't know what's going to happen. Of course it's good to see our old favourites back. Han, Chewie, Leia, R2-D2, C-3PO, even the Millennium Falcon – all of these received applause at my screening. Those claiming this film relies on nostalgia/good will towards the original films alone are mistaken. Whilst the prequels included familiar characters/moments just for the sake of callbacks, what they do here is much more satisfying. Han's his usual charming, funny, \"scruffy-looking nerf-herder\" self, but he forms attachments to our new characters, and his dynamics with them allows for some of the film's best moments. The movie certainly has humour, but thankfully it's not the \"cutsie\" nauseating variety found in the prequels. There's genuinely funny moments for young and old alike.  J.J. Abrams has been unfairly criticised, when he should be receiving thanks for bringing the Star Wars Saga back from the brink/re-energising it after the prequels. So what if there's some familiarity? My only quibbles were Domhnall Gleeson's shouting/performance, the somewhat hit-and-miss soundtrack, and Andy Serkis' CGI Supreme Leader Snoke - since, in most other instances, Abrams ensured that (along with story/character development) locations/miniatures/practical effects and make-up took precedence over a reliance on CGI/things that simply 'looked cool'. The sequels have their work cut out for them in matching this thrilling/exciting, enjoyable and satisfying first chapter of a new era in the saga, but if this film's anything to go by, the next two should be safe in the hands. Finally, we have a new hope. What more could anyone (without impossible standards) wish for?\n",
      "Good Movie! Dumb Reviews! Okay, I'm coming straight off the bat and saying that this was a really entertaining movie - period. It's not perfect but it is definitely an excellent film with lots of great aspects. The acting, screenplay, directing were all well above average (especially when you consider how terrible the prequels were). It had a wonderful sense of fun and borrowed a bit from it's predecessors (I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing as the originals were awesome). I felt it was a worthy successor to the original Star Wars movies. I have literally waited a lifetime to see what would happen after episode six and I wasn't disappointed. That is a huge achievement in itself. And better yet it has helped rid me of the painful memories of Mr Lucas trying to ruin the originals by 'updating' them and of course, those God awful prequels. I felt this movie was strongest in the first and last thirds of the film with the middle being a tad clunky. That being said I am not complaining. Actually the only thing I will complain about is some of the reviews I read on IMDb this morning. What kind of an idiot could sit through this movie and then only give it one star! I believe everyone has the right to an opinion but seriously, some reviewers here are completely off the mark. If a movie has a bad script or painful acting (like the prequels or The Room) by all means crucify it in your review. But if a movie has a good level of humour, interesting characters, a good tempo, a plot, solid acting, a little bit of intrigue, then don't review it poorly just because you can. I would go so far as to say that anyone who has given a review with below five stars for this movie has no idea what constitutes a good movie and should be ignored. My little rant over, I'll just say this movie was a worthy addition to the Star Wars universe (or multiverse now that the books don't count). I left the movie last night feeling very emotional as one of my childhood dreams had finally come to fruition. I hope when you see it you feel like I did and that you don't get put off by people with no idea about how to review a film.\n",
      "Surrogate Star Wars: Competent but shallow trope-fest fails to recapture magic of originals There is an essence of Star Wars that has made it more than just a film, but rather the dominant myth of our culture. That is the promise of adventure, the depth of its world, and the resonance of its central drama and spiritual struggle. All these can transcend shoddy dialogue, pat storytelling, and intermittent tonal missteps. With its evocative title, in the opening scenes The Force Awakens promises to rediscover the magic, if mainly because these are new characters in fresh settings. The interaction between the winsome Boyega, Ridley and BB8, while basic, is spirited, and the still- masked Kylo Ren promises to be a nuanced, powerful presence. An entire galaxy awaits. But the moment Harrison Ford walks into the Millennium Falcon – to applause of recognition from the first-night audience - all the possibilities are extinguished.  Suddenly, we are watching an unsolicited tag-on to a story that has already been told. What were once heroes in their prime going through the most vital moments of their lives, are now physically unconvincing pensioners, caked in make-up and CGI, reliving them in a manner that appears forced, sorry, and vaguely undignified. The protagonists of the original trilogy could have been an alluring myth on the outskirts of the narrative, or shuttled in for an effective cameo – nostalgic or heroic – but placing them at the heart of the new film constricts and misshapes it. With Han, Leia and Luke on-board, the plot sets a familiar course, though having to accommodate both old and new protagonists and stories within the scope of one film, the pacing and structure are often jumpy, and the set ups and payoffs lack dramatic weight. More generally, with its endless inter-generational family dramas and ever-bigger Death Stars to be destroyed through the exploitation of an engineering vulnerability, the main storyline of Star Wars risks collapsing into self-parody. A scene such as Kylo Ren praying to the desiccated helmet of Darth Vader, is written to summon a chill of history, and gasps of awe, but could as easily elicit pretension- bursting laughter. Yet the film's creators do not shy away from the tropes, but embrace them. George Lucas – he of the \"rhyming stanzas\" – could claim proud ownership of the tiresome symmetries, plot recycling and continuity porn of The Force Awakens. But Chewbacca, cantinas, solo enemy base escapes, the Millennium Falcon do not bring back the feeling of Star Wars, and instead every new laboured coincidence introducing familiar elements only makes the galaxy seem smaller, and diminishes that lure of the unknown that made the original trilogy what it is. But the new elements the makers of The Force Awakens have brought to the saga also show that they appear to have an unsteady grasp of the fundamental appeal of the old films. Formally, director JJ Abrams studiously avoids the CGI-heavy feel of Episodes I to III, replicating the physical presence of the originals. Yet he also adds a gloss and a busyness to the proceedings that strips Star Wars of its depth, something Lucas always strove towards, even when he was unable to skilfully establish it. We visit several worlds, but there is little wonder, as plot dominates over atmosphere. There is no time for binary sunsets, or the swamps of Dagobah here, and as a result world of the film seems shallower, almost consciously so, with greater emphasis on the diet of wisecracks and blaster shots. In fact, the unpropitious mix of the old and the new, brings nothing so much to mind as fan fiction, or a lesser Star Wars game. The film seems over-familiar and full of fanservice, but also strangely \"off\" – off-brand and off-kilter - parsecs away from the authentic soul of the saga.  As an experience, The Force Awakens is not unenjoyable, though it seems less fun the longer it goes on, and those fans enthusiastically cheering every familiar object in the first half, gave only a half-hearted smattering of applause at the end. But it fails, and barely tries to live up to the promise of Star Wars. Heavy narrative baggage, and endless outside commercial and production considerations do not necessarily align with making the best Star Wars movie possible. And while it is evident that the film was made with painstaking effort, the restrictions those behind it placed on themselves were too great to craft an enchanting new story. The makers of The Force Awakens will see it as transitional episode, and hope that the young characters will truly take flight in the next episode and beyond, but the tractor beam of the past may be too strong, and their thrusters too underpowered.\n",
      "This is a big let down but why are we surprised? Where to start from? I do not even know how to explain this film. Let me first say that I am one of the BIGGEST fans of Star Wars. I even like Jar Jar... but this, this is not Jar jar, this is not even star wars. This is some space film with star wars characters in it... I cannot call it a remake, because a remake is something that duplicates the old one trying to make it look better. It would of been actually nice if they had made a remake. Ohhh Disney we would buy your toys anyway, no need for this type of rubbish. OK too much negativism... Let me actually do a proper review.. I am just too disappointed. Now positives: 1. I liked the main characters (Fin and Rey) 2. I love that the old characters were in there although we saw Luke only for a minute. Why was he not in the trailer.. The answer is because he was not in this movie, he was reserved for the next one. 3. CGI was good, not the best but still good. 4. Costumes were first-class. 5. Camera was good... 6. The cast was good, I liked the actors chosen for this film, apart from the villains but this is for the negative bits of the review. 7. It is called Star Wars and Han is there as well ... 8. Mystery .Who is who? I think this is pretty much all the positive stuff in this film...  Negatives:  1. Villains are a joke ...One ugly, funny looking supreme leader and a Sith lord with big ears, childish looking and funny Robot mask that must change the voice. Ohh I want to be like my grandfather... But i will never be... Ohh man i can go on and on...  2. 30 X fighters take on a 100000 bad ass space ships and actually win... it was fine for 1977 but its a bit too much to repeat the story again and say it is a brand new.story.. As i said we cannot call it a remake 3. We want more Jedi stuff and more light saber fights ... And please just please Disney do not ever use this Cross light saber that looks more like I made it myself type of light saber...  4. NOW IMPORTANT THING ... Where the hell is the story... Seriously ... a droid keeping secret that is not of any use because R2 D2 is hibernating... then a storm trooper who wants to be a good guy and also falls in love with a Jedi wanna be... A brother and sister (Rey) and The funny mask guy ... but we still do not know that and we do not know how are they related... Then she is waiting for her family but they are never coming back.. she never had a Jedi training but yet again she nearly killed an experienced Sith Lord. Ohh well he was injured but who cares he is trained for this S..t!!! OK they wanted to leave many questions for the next film but this is not the way to do so. There are much clever ways of doing it... Like stating the obvious but leaving it open so the audience can only guess. This is boldly stupid... Like i do not know that Luke is going to train her... and that funny alien looking villain wanna be will take that funny mask guy to finish off his training... Chubaka is going to be Rey's right hand ... Luke is going to die at some point but he is very powerful.. Leia is realising this little girl is her daughter ... The storm trooper is madly truly and deeply in love with her ... Oh they might add the twist and she might fall in love with the pilot instead and feel the black dude more of a brother instead.... Guys you could of build up the story and leave the action for the next episode.  5. The death of Han Solo... Guys please ... How the hell did you even allow this to happen.. Killed by his son on some stupid bridge with a cross light saber that he is holding... No proper conversation, no explanation ... just... OH let me stab my dad and let him fly off the bridge ... nicely. after 6 episodes we decide to kill one of the most lovable characters without even leaving him the chance to fight... Ohh yeah this is because he would never fight his ugly big eared son... Pathetic ... Then Leia felt it .. R2 D2 also felt it and woke up... Nice ..... Luke is just chilling out on a funny rocky planet ... Meditating ...  6. Everyone is looking for Luke ... wow nice ... So what would happen if they find him.. Kill him? Kiss him? Ohh wait turn him into the dark side... Or the funny alien wants to fight him... Well good luck with that.  7. The republic (Why the hell did you destroy the republic so easy) Seriously guys this is even out of order. I am tired of giving negative feedback. There is so much more that I can say about this film. You guessed it folks I won't do it. Just because I love Star Wars all 6 of them even the first one. Do you know why? Because there is story, it is original and there is everything that we need, although not as good as the old 3 films still Star Wars. Out of respect I give 2 stars. Will I watch this again, probably not. Will i watch the next one. Yes I will but I will not have such high expectations. We all know how this ends.\n",
      "There has been an awakening... Spoilers within. The first words out of Han Solo's mouth are \"Chewie, we're home\". And I think that The Force Awakens has made me feel the same way, against all the odds. The world of Jakku is immediately familiar to all those who watched Luke gaze at the twin suns of Tattoine for the first time in 1977. There are some gorgeous shots of unspeakable scale of a decayed Death Star lying in the desert sands that immediately speak 'aged future' much like the original trilogy did. And the scavenger in Rey, played with moxie and endearing ferocity by Daisy Ridley, reminds me of a similar explorer, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. She too explores the husk of a broken, long forgotten world.  The plot too is familiar, perhaps overly so, by Lawrence Kaskan. Once again the Jedi have faded into mystery, and the Empire has manifested into yet another legion ruling over the systems with its might. The opening scrawl is less impressive and otherworldly as it once was with this in mind. We have another Vader, another Han Solo, another secret Sith master who hides in the shadows and speaks of vague evils...and as we close, we search for another Jedi master much like Luke did for Yoda. And there is another gigantic Death Star needing to be exploded in spectacular fashion.  It is then with futility that Han Solo bids his goodbye to Star Wars. He falls in an identical manner to Obi Wan, with friends desperately onlooking, and cut down by someone close who has given way to the dark side. This is troubling because not only is Kylo Ren played unconvincingly, where his most vulnerable moments without his helmet give way to the plain face of Adam Driver, spouting a boy band haircut and shouting of the Dark Side without much actual justification for why he defected, but also because it veers dangerously close to the same redemption path of Vader himself. To redo that story with a fraction of the conflict and without a hint of backstory would be unsatisfying.  He does not have the backing power of the Imperial March theme as Vader once did, but demonstrates his terror in other ways. The sound design and visual and special effects are fantastic as expected. The first showing of the force suspends a blaster beam in mid-air, and the lightsabers make the entire frame tremble, and fills the theatre with that unmistakable hum, buzzing and crackling with deadly red force. Overhead, entire planets are destroyed without mercy. The markets of Jakku and the watering rebel hole are created with ease, although with nothing as iconic as the Cantina Band. Less impressive is the JJ Abrams method of obscuring his action scenes with his trademark smoke and sparks that seem pervasive throughout the galaxy. Like his Mission Impossible movies, sparks are literally everywhere a fight occurs, even as lightsabers cut up frozen trees and blasters are fired at rocks and dirt. As the Millennium Falcon takes flight, whip pans and shaky-cam are a tad overused. At times, the action is rendered unwatchable.  The best performance is Ridley's Rey, who is tough and vulnerable and capable. Joining her is Boyega's Finn, whose story arc is natural (maybe made a little ridiculous when blood is smeared on a stormtrooper's helmet, which are newer and sleeker but still not a substitute for an actual face) and whose comedic timing and chemistry with his co-star make them very easy to root for. Equally as good is BB-8, who brings the same charm and humour to the group much like R2D2 originally did. Isaac's Poe is charismatic enough, although no Han Solo. The worst belong to Christie's Phasma, whom is given as many lines as Boba Fett, and an imposing shiny suit, but never so much as fires a blaster and is irrelevant. Gleeson's Hux is also forgetful, save for a riveting speech to his battalions where his face quivers with maniacal anticipation and bloodlust. And it seems that Supreme Leader Snoke is overcompensating with big evil dialogue and a transmitter that portrays him as towering and monstrous. Ah yes, he is finally going to complete his training. Never heard that one before. I got chills as the iconic score and scrawl opened the movie, and I very much want to see it again. I think that is the most important thing with Star Wars.\n",
      "The Force Awakens captures the Spirit and Magic of Star Wars In a galaxy far, far away",
      " Star Wars. It's about time we should see that opening to a film. 10 years since the last Star Wars Film, J.J Abrams takes the time to get it right. And he does it perfectly. I won't say anything about the plot, because I'm sure you want to find what it is yourself. But I will tell you of a New, Epic Adventure.  The Force Awakens gets it right. It blends old and new together in a way the prequel Trilogy really failed to do. We had new characters( Finn, Rey, Poe, Kylo Ren, BB-8) and old ( Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, C3PO, R2-D2), that combined together to make a fitting and suitable Stars Wars film that would make George Lucas Proud. The Force Awakens doesn't make the mistake of copying everything awesome about the original trilogy, but it respects and honours it. It makes its only original story, and it really is quite a great story. But that's enough of me, I think you would rather see this Fantastic Film then listen to me ramble on about it",

      "Fresh and as exciting as watching the first Star Wars 38 Years Ago Just from a packed first showing @ 12:01 am in Exeter, UK of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (in 3D). Remarkably I saw the first in 1977 on a first showing, and subsequent ones in between. Probably makes me a geek &amp; definitely a Star Wars fan, however I did go to this viewing with some trepidation. New director, main characters, different studio.... could they keep it fresh and maintain the well worked recipe of success the previous six, George Lucas had conjured up? The answer is J. J. Abrams &amp; crew produced a total success,obviously created with love and affection of watching previous versions. Great story with continuity of the Star Wars saga, new graphics / CGI, but with a perfect blend of old characters with new, yet the familiar Star Wars places and technology. A must see on the big screen, especially in 3d, for young and old whether a fan of the previous films or not. I can guarantee no one will be bored. Thanks Disney, and will book for a first showing for the follow up. Next year?\n",
      "Disappointing I don't even know where to start with this. It was obvious JJ Abrams had never bothered watching any of the previous movies or there wouldn't have been so many mistakes such as, when the f**k has anyone ever seen a 2 man TIE Fighter. Then you get some random sand junkie who has never piloted before but manages to fly the Millennium Falcon as if she was a Battle of Britain vet. The acting between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher was wooden, especially since they had kids together. As much as I hated the Phantom Menace for all its flaws and Ja Ja Binkses, It towers above this movie as the plot makes absolutely no sense what so ever as a carry on from episode VI. I had been looking forward to this film for a long time, but it looks like Disney is just trying to cash in on a well loved franchise with cheap un-humorous jokes without taking in any of the previous films that it is supposed to supersede.\n",
      "R U kidding me JJ?  SPOILER ALERT This is even too good grade for this movie but its based on that I was sure Kylo will spare his father Han Solo but he killed him, rest of it was a joke Rey finds out in this particular movie she is Force sensitive and after 30 minutes without any training she is ready to confront Kylo Ren and she almost killed him. WTF?! Also light-saber fights are super slow, like we are back in 70' not in 2015. This movie is a joke for everyone who watched all 6 previous episodes For me personally movie is too focused on trooper fights , I would like to see more light - saber fights but that is just my opinion CGI s look great , starship fights absolutely great but that is not their credit that much , it is just technological advancement\n",
      "utter money making bull Without doubt the worst and most disappointing film I have ever seen. There is no way that anyone looked at this films script and thought anything other than the amount of money they would make on a terrible film. How it has such high reviews I have no idea. I'm half expecting some sort of protest or parliamentary legislation to come through giving everyone a full refund out of the dirt bag money grabbing creators own pockets. So much expectation and ignorance from me and any other disappointed fans on release day but to anyone who considers buying the DVD after the general view of the film has come out, it's your own fault. If my own mother was on her last legs and had only 2 hours and 15 minutes left to live and wanted me to sit and watch it with her while she slowly passed, I would let her die on her own rather than watching this film again. Very very annoyed, countless inconsistencies, rushed story and very poor acting. Ruined star wars\n",
      "Casual watchers will love it but die hard fans will be torn. I want to begin this by saying I'm not a massive fan of the franchise. I've watched all of the saga and really enjoyed them as a kid, and I was actually quite looking forward to this installment. The film boasts a plethora of exhilarating action scenes and fantastic visuals but its narrative, writing and character development is where it lacks. The story takes parts of the previous plots and freshens them up with some new faces and some quality CGI but it all seems too familiar and predictable. The characters are just dull. They show no real personality and personally, I just didn't care about them enough to want them to survive the ordeal. It was great to see the old cast make a reappearance but it seemed extremely forced; they proved barely nothing to the actual plot and seemed like they were there just to appease fans of the old series. Also, the new villain is probably one of the most uninspired characters in the saga; a tasteless being with a bipolar accent between American, Scottish and Irish and a reused backstory. The main narrative is a loose repeat of 'A New Hope' but it wasn't executed as well and just dragged on for the 2 hour and 15 minute runtime. The writing wasn't great. I feel like since Disney got their hands on the franchise, they've completely encapsulated it by adding ridiculous amounts of comedy in a way that comes off as slapstick and seems way too modern and contrasts the serious moments terribly. Overall, I think that the new generation are gonna love it because it's harmless fun and it's a predominantly young cast. I also think it's a great platform for the new actors who are all relatively unknown but I think dedicated fans are gonna have a very 'Marmite' opinion of this; they'll either love it or disregard it entirely. Me, personally, think the saga should've ended with Return of the Jedi.\n",
      "A remake of episode IV Story: the script written by Abraams himself along with Lawrence Kasdan (who co-wrote \"Empire\" and \"Jedi\") is a solid block of fan service towards Episode IV. It follows identical story patterns - desert planet, kid ready to go off on adventure, mentor comes along the way,etc - but some nice (humorous) twists left and right. Although it delivers with no cringe-worthy scenes, Abraams seems to be focused too much in \"New Hope\" as he tries avoid the (hilarious) wrath of the internet fan boys. Whereas this is not necessarily a bad decision, it would be been a greater challenge to try to distinguish his film from old ties and allow himself to follow our (old and new) heroes in different settings rather than familiar ones. Of course, this is Star Wars, it had never been about breaking the rules or groundbreaking story material, it is all about family relationships.  Themes: The character interaction is worth the price of the admission alone and it is simply magical to see all those icons that you love talking to each. Main focus here remains the connections between them and the family ties that each one may carry on their shoulders. It had always been a eye catching dynamic that has been explored in the last six films successfully - how Luke reacts to his father's news, how Anakin is going to save Padme, etc - and if it is not broken why fix it? Abraams knows he has a goldmine of characters the audience is willing to see in action surrounded by love, betrayal, friendship, care and heroism and commits rightfully so. Characters: Episode VII boasts a phenomenal cast - from the main protagonist duo to the film's primary villain. It's a pleasure to have Harrison Ford back as Han Solo with the most scene stealing moments and his chemistry with Fisher and Mayhew (Chewbacca) still holds strong since 1983. It is evident that Ford is having a blast at the iconic role and it seems that it has not passed a day since the concluding events of the \"Return of the Jedi\". Carrie Fisher has little screen time (unexpectedly) but does justice to the material and regarding Mark Hamill's appearance much cannot be said without giving anything away. Among the newcomers, Daisy Ridley makes a strong impact - likable, fierce and vulnerable - she brings a freshness to the Star Wars myths by being almost at the center of the story in a rather dominant boy- ish series. John Boyega is surprisingly charismatic (and amps the humor to 11!) although his character is rather blunt sometimes and feels like filler. Other wellknown cast members are either minimized cameos - Max Von Sydow, Gwendoline Christie come to mind, what a waste!, or glorified ones - looking at you Oscar Isaac. and this is where the film mostly crumbles. An overabundance of characters offer almost nothing at the proceedings instead they are used as an excuse to move the plot forward. It is admirable that Abraams tries to recreate a vivid world of Star Wars but at one point, we are not caring for most of them as they carry almost no significance or dramatic weight. Villain: The best element in the film, main player here is Kylo Ren portrayed by Adam Driver. A rather menacing (and badass) presence, his story arc is by far the most interesting with some nifty emotional touches. Driver plays Ren's obsession/confusion to perfection and surely has the most development in the movie. Not only, he summarizes what is wrong with the dark side, tiny little details regarding his emotional attributes build up his character without requiring much heavy handed exposition or long monologues. At this part, Abraams and Co have succeeded tremendously and Driver's performance carries a dramatic (and tragic) weight reminding the glory of \"Revenge of the Sith\"'s final act. Direction: Abraams' direction is solid, dynamic and evidently from the Star Trek entries serviceable with similar blended display of CGI and practical effects. However, despite the presence of some inspiring dog fight sequences, Abraams seems to struggle with the lightsaber battle suffering from close ups and intense edit despite the atmospheric setting. It is always good to see no lens flare! - thank you for that - and him trying to keep consistent with the visual flare of the previous films. Following George Lucas's directing (and static) style with a bit of more dramatic movement in the space scenes feels like a natural evolution for a modern entry in the SW canon. Particularly, there is a wonderful shot of Finn fighting his way through a Stormtrooper squad while on the background Dameron is blasting lasers on Tie-fighters. Brilliant. however, it does not bring back any memorable moments due to his insistence to follow the patterns of Episode IV. Although there is a clear enthusiasm, he gets caught in his own excitement to recreate probably his nostalgia. All six films boasted some truly memorable set pieces (Vader vs Luke in Empire, Duel of the fates scene, pd race, Emperor confrontation in Jedi) or visual style (who can forget the almost renaissance like lava landscapes of Mustafar?), yet here, despite the state of the art talent involved, the films feels more a fan service checklist rather than a fully fleshed out adventure. Despite being a technical thrill and a treat for the holiday season, Episode VII though lacks any emotional punch while it is focused on pulling off the nostalgia flag rather than initiate excitement with something new. Abraams has done a serviceable job as the franchise's first helmer with adequate action scenes and a great cast. He falls short though as he sidelines interesting personalities, events and mini plots threads at the expense of the fan service with a blink and you miss ending that sets up further entries.\n",
      "A Brand New Hope After months of eagerly awaiting the star wars franchise to return and with mostly high hopes from the director \"J.J.Abrams\" I returned home from the midnight release of this classic movie with feelings a movie hasn't made me feel in a very long time. I returned home quickly removing my t shirt to cool down from the sweaty grip of the cinema screen, feeling almost relieved that it was over but desperately wanting more. The curtains widened and the classic rolling yellow letters appeared on screen accompanied by \"John Williams\" iconic soundtrack and after that everything fell into place. The return of everyone's favorite characters created immense amounts of nostalgia and I couldn't help but have a big cheesy grin on my face every time a familiar face appeared. The new cast were equally as good as the oldies and an exceptional performance from \"Oscar Isaac\" as to be expected, these new performances really held the movie together. The characters the new cast played were brilliant and fitted in great with the star wars story. The main winning point for this movie is the sheer fact that it most definitely is Star Wars, from start to finish it was good old Star Wars, Bravo.\n",
      "Star Wars: The Force Awakens - a eulogy I just came back from a midnight screening and i have to tell you how it went. There are no spoilers in this piece because it's impossible to spoil this film. There are no words....sorry i have to rephrase...there is no language known to man to describe my shock and utter disgust upon watching this abomination. I'm a middle aged man in my forties and i have watched thousands of movies in my lifetime. This one is by far , by a million miles, the worst movie i had ever the discomfort to endure. It was a disgrace. I believe there is no original idea in the script, not a single one! If you have ever watched \"Star Wars: A new hope\" don't bother. Its indistinguishable from this one. Its a total rip-off. At one point i wanted to cut my right arm of and f*** myself with my detached limb to distribute the pain evenly. It was unbearable. If it wasn't for the mercy killing towards the end i would have left the theater. My eyes were burning from witnessing the greatest debacle of the film industry since...since...since when actually? Nothing comes to mind! For the first time in my life i heard an audience booing at the end mixed with sighs of relief. About half of the people left early. Oh, how i envy those lucky bastards. Anger and disbelief followed by growing numbness of the face. If you are suicidal watch this film! It gives hope to the the hopeless,cause you truly know what rock bottom is after watching it. There is no point in criticizing specific aspects of the film. Its a total failure across-the-board. Its an all- encompassing disaster of epic proportions. Decades from now people will stand in awe reading pages after pages of inconsistencies meticulously collected by former fans of the franchise. A last service rendered to one of the greatest stories ever told. Star Wars died today. And in the end, it was a relief. Years from now, when you look back on your life you will remember Star Wars as something best described by John and Paul: \"And in the end, the love you take Is equal to the love you make.\"\n",
      "It is not a sequel, but a remake Sad but true. When the opening credits filled the screen (Episode VII... blah blah) I was already grinding my teeth because the plot sounded idiotic. Then the huge star destroyer filled the screen. The fun bit is that the star destroyer had some sort of antenna or whatever at the front and it looked liked the ship was showing the middle finger towards the viewers.  I have to congratulate the film makers as that was pretty much how the film worked from that point forward.  1) A droid has important information that must be delivered to the good guys (Episode IV, anyone?) 2) so the bad guys hunt for the droid on a desert planet (IV)  3) Storm troopers raid a village, killing everyone (IV)  4) A girl is captured by the bad guys and the good guys rush to the base to the rescue. (IV)  5) The girl and the boy have a friend zone relationship through the film (Ep IV, Luke &amp; Leia, wouldn't be surprised to learn that they are siblings in Episode IX)  6) The stormtroopers, elite soldiers of the bad guys, still can't hit a barn door. On the other hand, the good guys always hit, even when they use a weapon for the first time in their life  7) Supreme Leader Snoke = Emperor with a silly name  8) The bad guys have a magnificent new weapon that can destroy planets (Ep IV)  9) They use it to destroy a planet loyal to the rebels (IV)  10) The weapon has shields that can be destroyed by going down on the planet and disabling the shield generator (VI)  11) The epic villain wears a mask that distorts his voice (IV) and sadly, looks better with the mask on than without it. 12) The good guys can only destroy the weapon with an attack by X-Wings on the exact target (IV)  13) The X-Wings have to fly in a tight trench in order to reach their target (IV) The screen writers had absolutely no new ideas to show for their money. A bunch of monkeys could have written better dialogue. A 1st grader could have made a plot that had less holes in it. The special effects were pretty much of the same quality as in the first Star Wars movie that was released 1977. I'd expect something way better in 2015.\n",
      "Star Wars: The Force Gets Boring Have you ever disagreed with someone about the quality of a production so intensely that you've wondered if the two of you even watched the same film? I'm sorry, everyone in the world, I thought The Force Awakens was a real snoozer. I'm not surprised that my eight year old nephew loved it, but I can't for the life of me figure out why the adults I associate with aren't offended at what we've been offered by Abrams as the continuation of the world's foremost loved space epic.  Essentially what it feels like is a reboot of the original series, except this time for kids (no surprise there, Disney), not a meaningful continuation that picks up where the originals left off. Although I did start having my doubts about my future satisfaction with the Star Wars franchise when Disney made its Star Wars paraphernalia so pervasive that one morning I found myself unconsciously buttering my toast with DeathStar Margarine Spread©. Yeah—head trip, but I got over it.  There was virtually zero discussion within the movie itself as to what happened after episode Vl and how we got to where we are now, making this production feel like a desperate lurch to be a stand-alone and to appeal to an audience who is too young to have appreciated the Spice Girls let alone the originals. This direction may be satisfying for some, but for those of us who were expecting more will find ourselves disappointed. Furthermore, I was saddened by the obvious deficiency surrounding the exploration of the mythology of the Force. One of the elements that so intrigued viewers about the originals was the underlying spirituality and the metaphysical forces at play within the Star Wars universe; however, in this version of Star Wars Abrams seems to care more about the characters ceaselessly running away from things and having meaningless, often silly conversation (like in one scene the character Finn asks Rey in the goofiest way possible if she has a boyfriend—I laughed but I was so ashamed) instead of exploring the depths of some of the most intriguing supernatural philosophy in all of moviedom. However, this fact is not surprising as the masses seem to be entertained predominantly by action, comedy, flashing lights, and explosions, not exploring the psychological latitudes of light and dark within the human soul, and definitely not sitting through slow scenes of dialogue which could (God forbid) give us an understanding of the depths of the Star Wars legend and mystery. I suppose in this regard (and in too many others) Abrams gave the people what they wanted. Not only was the confined exploration of the Force disappointing but so was the serious lack of emotional poignancy. At no point, AT LITERALLY NO POINT, did I feel sad, frustrated, anxious, worried, or exhilarated during its belabored two hours and sixteen minutes. The characters felt like they could be potentially cloned from any PG-13 teen movie you've seen since Twilight hijacked the world and forced it's twisted, disgusting version of acceptable adolescent stereotypes upon us. You could almost swap out the light-sabers, tie-fighters, and storm troopers and you'd have a great sequel to whatever the hell number Hunger Games we're on these days (because that's how interesting the rest of the plot was).  Another thing that really annoyed me was the way in which the galaxy was too American. Of course I get it, it was made by Hollywood IT IS American, but guys, this is supposed to be in a GALAXY FAR AWAY, so why was there very little attempt made to try and hide that? Between the all too familiar mannerisms, jokes, and language I just couldn't fully suspend my disbelief. In my opinion, the originals managed to avoid most overt use of cultural indicators, I mean sure, it's impossible to avoid all due to obvious limitations, but watch the main character Finn carefully during the movie and you'll see that he's dripping with 21st century western American dude. Like literally drenched. Where was the otherworldly authenticity among the main characters?  Of course it wasn't all bad. The visuals were beautiful, much of the topography and effects were breathtaking, and I have to admit that I did feel pangs of nostalgia over any scene that included an X-wing, but overall it wasn't enough. Really a lot of what it comes down to is expectation. So many people have told me that they went into it not expecting too much and that they had \"fun\" watching it; and then there's me sitting here thinking: what on Tatooine are they talking about? With all the media hype this film received, not to mention the disappointment of the prequels, I was expecting a hell of a lot out of this movie, and simple fun ain't gonna cut it. Abrams seemed to have carved the profundity and soul out of Star Wars with a lightsaber— the same soul we've been waiting to enter our lives again ever since the prequels ruined them.  The Force Awakens was half way there, but it felt forced (pun intended), shallow, in need of a more refined plot, more mature characters, a deeper spirituality, moral complexity and depth; it needed to resonate more deeply with the IMPORTANT themes of the original, and to not have felt like a chaste teen romance with some old faces in there used like a box office tractor beam. If you're content with having your childhood favorite epic turned into a lovable, easily digestible icon of twenty-first century pop culture, marketed intentionally at young people to delight and entertain whilst simultaneously causing you to cringe at the fact that the original actors are okay with such a disservice to a beloved story, then you will enjoy the continuation of this franchise.  May the force save us from this trilogy.\n",
      "Boring and Predictable I jut got just back from the cinema, watching a movie everyone has been waiting for since 1983, me included. And i got to say, I'm starting to get a little bit tired of watching a 2 hour movie about destroying a death star. Because here we go again! George Lucas did not succeed with his follow-up movies, and there is many reasons for that. And no, it is mainly not because of Jar-Jar, it is because he just threw in one epic battle after the other, without having any good story, or any good plot, and at times horrible acting to come with it. Michael Bay has this as his trademark, but he is still very successful and his movies makes billions. And why is that?. Because kids. And the Star wars and transformers franchises have in common that they sell toys, in large quantity. This is what really makes the big bucks over time. Not the movies themselves. The movies are just big commercials for toys. George Lucas knew this better than anyone. And he is a brilliant businessman, but not so brilliant when it comes to making movies. I do like the first Star wars trilogy, with \"the empire strikes back\" as my favorite, this is by the way the film in the trilogy George Lucas himself dislikes the most. That pretty much explains why the second trilogy was so bad, as \"The Empire Strikes back\" spends more time developing a story than the other two films in the original trilogy, and therefor you get more attached to the characters. When George Lucas then made His second trilogy, all character development went out the window. This was a trilogy that was going to sell more toys, and that's it. Lucas has even half-way admitted this later on. And the fans of the Star wars franchise have disliked the second trilogy almost since release. I say almost, because many did hang in there for years, denying that the second trilogy was bad. But now most people seem to have noticed. So here we are in 2015 and J.J. Abrams takes over. He is the new skip, he gave us a fantastic reboot with Star Trek, now he is going to save us all from the god awful mistakes of George Lucas. We all believed it, we all hoped for it, at least he can not do worse than Lucas. The biggest hype of all time was born. And we fight a death star.... again.... Just a lot bigger.... Because of course bigger, at least they couldn't make it smaller..... What about not including a death star... Yet again? This movie tries so hard to show us a lot of cool stuff. But the pacing is awful, the slapstick humor is mostly misplaced, the introduction of the leading actors suffers from very bad timing. This movie basically tries to look and feel exactly like the original Star Wars film, but fails to bring us close to the leading characters. In the story, 30 years has gone by. A lot of things happen in that time, but the movie can't tell us anything about what has happened in those 30 years, all we get is guns blazing from the get go, till the very end. Almost no character development what so ever. Not even for Rey, the leading actress. Did J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan think it was enough to show us that when Rey eats less food than usual, was enough to make us really care for her? And just add in the \"The family will never come back for you\" sub plot? which BTW has no impact. Yes OK Rey is struggling a bit when we meet her, but she looks very healthy, she is climbing ropes and running like an Olympian in sand.. Ahh no, now i know. They showed us she had good morale by not selling the droid to get a lot more food.. Ahh.. So complicated. *sigh* This movie is so disappointing. This was their chance to make it right. To make Star Wars good again, not only focus on what 12 year old kids want to see constantly for 2 hours, which is laser beams and explosions. But it makes perfect sense, because these films are now all about making the big bucks, which is from selling toys. And now this film was released just before Christmas... No coincidence. So it's time to just take in some facts, the movies we grew up with, are never coming back. The only ones in the business that seem to get the movie story and toys business combo right, is Marvel. They had all this time. All this money. All this willpower. And this is what they come up with. Terrible script, bad story, outdated soundtrack, taking few or no risks to renew the franchise by telling the exact same story as before. What is really good about this film is the CGI and Sound effects. But that should not come as a surprise to anyone. The acting is mediocre. No one stands out and brings a really good performance. 4/10 - Very disappointing.\n",
      "It's like when an unknown Chinese manufacturer decided to make a fake iPhone So today I went to the premiere of the long awaited new star wars Episode 7.  Here is a fast and short opinion: The movie blows really blows.  Here is the more detailed opinion. The movie has no star wars feeling. None. No deep dialogs about the force and almost no background about what happened in the period between episode 6 and this one.  The dialogs between Ray and Finn sound like two modern age teenagers talking (first real dialogue between them, Finn asks Ray if she has a boyfriend). Horrible. Then there is the First Order (successors of The Empire) the bad guys. Their leader commander is the Sith wimp Kylo Ren who answers to a extremely bad CGI drawn Supreme leader (really?) about whom the audience doesn't get any information at all.  Kylo Ren is an insecure teenager with anger issues. His character destroys the sleek mysterious Sith presentation of the both prequel as the original trilogy. This is really a bad thing.  The main weapon of the First order is a death star on steroids. But the way the weapon works is taken straight out of Star Trek. This is a criminal offense.  Han Solo and Chewbacca appeared in the movie absolutely out of nowhere. It's like Abrams and Disney were desperate to throw them in there just for nostalgia.  Once again out of nowhere Ray figures out she has Jedi powers. The first time it happens is when Luke Skywalker's (who as been explained shortly decided abandon everyone and live in isolation in a place unknown) light-saber suddenly possesses the ability to show her where it's located in exactly the same way like bracelet of Anubis showed to Evelyn it's location in the movie Mummy returns. Also the audience figures out later on that non-Jedi's also can fight with light-sabers when Finn ( not a Jedi ) fight the wimpy Sith Kylo Ren. It's like who needs Jedi's, give a light-saber to a regular Joe and he will fight almost as good as a Jedi who had years of training.  There is one scene near the ending that is so incredibly bad it just makes you want to get up and leave the theater. It's a scene between Han Solo and Kylo Ren. Every person who has more than 2 brain cells will know what is going to happen. This scene is a direct spit in the face to the bad-ass Han Solo we all know and love. Conclusion:  Because Disney and Abrams decided not to include George Lucas in any way this movie has no Star wars feel and no soul. It's like when an unknown Chinese manufacturer decided to make a fake iPhone. They can call it an iPhone as much as they want, but it isn't an iPhone.\n",
      "The Manipulation Power of Nostalgia and Mass Appeal I want to start by stating I truly have enjoyed all Star Wars movies prior to this one. Even the prequels (which are obviously not as good) demolish this movie in plot, character building and EVEN action sequences. (there is only two lightsaber battles and they last seconds) Anyone with a brain and knowledge of the original trilogy can see that Star Wars: Episode VII was a regurgitation of the first three film's plot condensed into two hours. Everything was the same with slight twists down to the famous \"Luke, I am your father\" scene except it's with Han Solo and his apparent Sith son who stabs and throws off of the new Death Star. They added a bigger and badder Death Star, tossed Anakin's lightsaber around to whoever felt like using it to fight and did a terrible job of carrying on Star Wars essence. It was flooded with humor and half a**ed acting. There was no training or build up of power Rey is literally able to defeat the most powerful Sith Lord as a teenage girl who days before didn't even know she was a Jedi. Finn was able to wield and use a lightsaber although as far as I am concerned he is not a Jedi.  Han Solo and Chewbacca just happen to come across the Millennium Falcon after 30 years which just happens to have Luke Skywalker's daughter, Finn, and a droid carrying the map to Luke Skywalker on it. The film was pretty much downhill for me from this point on I spent most of my time watching this with a \"What???\" face and hands up in confusion as to how they could have made the film suck so bad. This film literally spanned out the introduction of old characters we know and love in order to keep our attention and keep us excited to see the next only to disappoint us with no further elaboration in story and literally no emotion. Leia hardly even reacted to losing the love of her life Han Solo. The dialogue between the two of them was rushed and obvious that they were trying to explain 30 years of story in small talk.  What I take as the mentality for this film: MAKE A BIGGER DEATHSTAR, OH BIGGER EMPEROR TOO (srsly what was up with that), GIRL JEDI MAIN CHARACTER, BLACK GUY WHO MIGHT BE A JEDI TOO MAIN CHARACTER (I am African American so don't take this as racism) people are going TO EAT THIS UP. And congratulations, you all did and now they will keep milking the franchise and making terribly thought out films with nothing more than CGI and humor to make up for it.  Throughout this film I found myself wanting to walk out of the theater and just be done but I couldn't resist waiting for the punchline of this joke of a film and boy did I get it. After all of the humor riddled torture we are brought to the final scene. Rey is going to see her long lost dad who I guess spent all of this time standing on a random mountain looking at the beach. And then it happens, what we had all been waiting for. Luke turns around and sees the daughter he was forced to abandon and she hold out Anakin's lightsaber as some odd tribute to him (I don't see the symbolism in this) at this point I just burst out laughing at how bad this journey has been and that's it it's over. The next thing I see is JJ Abrams. I proceeded to scream \"BOO\" at the screen multiple times with the only response to it being \"cmon it wasn't that bad\" after that I walked outside and contemplated throwing up as the movie was so bad it caused me to feel nauseous.  This film took advantage of Star Wars fans and played into a hand of re-doing famous scenes with different characters and telling the same story over again. It's sad that people actually think this movie was good or acceptable because now they are going to once again shame the Star Wars name. BOYCOTT EPISODE 8. THIS RENDITION NEEDS TO BE SCRAPPED AND REBOOTED THEY ARE JUST MILKING THIS FRANCHISE.\n",
      "Was this supposed to be a SEQUEL....or REBOOT? Failed miserably at both.... A small droid carrying classified data crash lands on desert planet. Meets teenage characters. Rebel Alliance needs the data to fight the Empire's new planet-destroying weapon. Rinse and repeat. Sound familiar? That was the plot to both Episode IV: A New Hope, and Jar-Jar Abrams latest calamity that just found its way onto cinema screens across the country. I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to like this movie-- but alas, we got yet another one of Abrams' typical mind-numbing explosion-fests. It has ALL of Jar-Jar Abrams normal movie failings: * A cast of characters almost entirely made up of pre-adolescents trying to play adult roles. * Dialogue/screenplay that seems like it was written by an 8-year old. * Nothing that even slightly resembles a plot. I am surprised Abrams didn't put \"Red Matter\" in this movie to fill in all the gaps between his weak story-telling and the plot loopholes it creates, like he did with Star Disaster XI. As is the case with most of the reboots he has done to date-- Abrams lacks the creativity and writing ability to come up with an original and compelling plot on his own, so he just plagiarizes an existing story and makes \"some changes\" to better fit his \"vision\" (as in LSD-induced) of it. He props up these mindless stories by inserting a bunch of unnecessary homage moments to famous lines and clichés from the previous established films in the mythos to try and give his creation validity (\"He's dead, Jim\"). Really? Another movie about destroying a death star? A droid carrying the plans that the Empire wants to stop from falling into Alliance hands? How original.... He doesn't care if his stories makes sense or not, or if he breaks his own rules; in Star Trek XI, like when the Enterprise could not beam up Spock's mother (because she was falling), but later in the movie, Scotty and Kirk beamed onto the Enterprise from another solar system while it was moving at warp speed with no problems! The Force Awakens had PLENTY of these \"Abrams' moments\". A wise man once told me-- \"The litmus test for good and bad storytelling comes down to this: do the actions of the characters in your story fit the background and motivations you gave them in your story history? If not-- it is GARBAGE.\" For instance, a Romulan captain, so enraged his home planet got destroyed-- would not sit on his hands for 25 years, waiting for Spock (who, given the complexity of time travel-- might NEVER have appeared) to show up, so he can blow up the entire galaxy (obviously Abrams does not understand interstellar distances) just to show everyone just how mad he really is!! Now there is a story that will be remembered over the ages.... The actors in this movie were so poor-- it was difficult to tell what exactly their motivations, passions, and driving ideals were. They all had about as much emotional content as Hayden Christiansen (little or none) from the prequels. * Explosions and guns ablazing, pretty much from the moment the beginning credits close until the end credits start rolling. By the time you are 5 minutes into the movie-- you are already bored and desensitized to it. I am not surprised to find that many of the people who thought Star Trek XI and XII (the one with a Caucasian Khanoonian Singh) were good movies, also think this movie was in any way memorable (other than the humongous sense of disappointment I walked out of the theater feeling). Jar-Jar Abrams should be banned from ruining any more legendary movie franchises. The fans themselves could have written a better story and backdrop for this film.\n",
      "Blockbuster: Unimaginative, cheap, no fantasy, lacked vision I loved all the previous star wars movies (yes, even the prequels).  But this, this was just deeply disappointing. I could get past all the cheap/easy typical Disney humour (which is actually enjoyable in cartoons) but the plot of the movie, lack of character development, and lack of star wars was just too much. The only thing making this movie resemble star wars were the old stars from the original movie. it was pleasant to see Han Solo, but only as a fan of the original film. Within itself, the whole Leia-Han Solo love story was completely destroyed by this movie. Their relationship seemed superficial. but it didn't really matter because there was just no time for character development or illustration of the depth of their relationship. The movie just needed to show more dull fight scenes, entirely recycled across the original trilogy.  The meaning and depth of the force was cheapened: apparently now a storm trooper can not just use a light saber but also fight and win with a Sith Lord (who at the beginning of the film was able to stop bullets mid air, kill with the force, and read people's minds).  The force doesn't awaken because we never see the force being forgotten. Instead the new characters at one recognize Han Solo and know everything there is to know about Skywalker: boring much?! Reminds me of a bad episode IV.  The plot of the film is essentially going to destroy the death star.... yes the death star... BUT NO WAIT IT'S 10X BIGGER IT'S FINE.  All in all, even writing the review is painful. I was expecting a beautifully executed movie, given the advancement of technology and funding for this. Instead I saw something so simple, I wanted to leave (during the premiere). Clearly, long gone are the days of incredible creatures, amazing costumes (shout out to Lucas). And in are the days of a cheap villain, who looks like he came straight out of a Disney princess movie: and acts the same....  Please, please, please improve the next movie. DO A PLOT. We can think for ourselves, I promise....\n",
      "Disappointment all around I was really looking forward to this movie even knowing that Abrams will be directing it. And now I wish I didn't watch. It was just bad. No other words for it. Everyone already said about plot being just a random rehash of previous episodes. We've already seen all situations, all locations, all plot turns. There's nothing original in this movie and it seems pointless in general.  SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Some basics of the SW Universe are changed to accommodate the characters. Now a guy who is not a Force-user can fight with a trained Sith using a lightsaber. Untrained Force-user can use jedi mindtricks with no training at all. Sith can feel a non-Force-user from across considerable distance but not if the same man is standing 10 meters apart from him. Stormtroopers see Sith have a fit if pointless hysterics and calmly walk away from him despite his summons. Light Side is a constant seduction to Siths. And so on and so on... It all feels like a badly written fanfic. END SPOILERS And it is also filmed badly. In all Star Wars movies first appearance of ship or a planet always was a momentous scene. This is totally lost here. Also there are many unflattering camera angles, poorly choreographed scenes, battle sequences are rushed and not always thought-out. With modern technology and special effects it could have been magnificent, but instead it's cheaply looking. I've caught myself thinking that \"A New Hope\" looked better and more advanced than this one. Maybe if you've never watched Star Wars you will like this movie, but for those familiar with old episodes it most probably will be a major let down. 1 out of 10 just because it' impossible to give 0.\n",
      "Not the Movie I Paid to See CRITIQUE  1. If you want to know what this movie is about, then simply watch Star Wars Episode IV (A New Hope), because the story is nearly verbatim with elements thrown in from episodes V and VI for good measure. 2. The leads who take the rein from the old Star Wars Universe are: Hispanic, black, and a woman. There is nothing wrong with this in and of itself, but when it is done simply to be politically correct, then the story suffers. I think one critic describes this best when she said, \"For the first time in Star Wars history, a franchise will be built around the adventures of the sort of people that Hollywood routinely overlooks: women and people of color. So even if The Force Awakens sucks, it's made one big diverse achievement for Hollywood.\" This means the only place you will see an honest review of this movie is in the user reviews here at IMDb 3. Luke is now Obi Wan, his long lost daughter is the new hope, and his nephew is the new Darth Vader 4. They broke nearly every rule established by the original Star Wars. Jedi talent no longer takes years of training, nor does one need to be strong with the force to hold his own in a light saber battle against a trained Sith lord, etc. WHAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE There are 100 places they could have taken this story. They could have made Jar Jar a secret Sith lord who was playing dumb all these years, they could have worked in elements of Star Wars Rebels and made Ezra a Sith lord, or they could have had it where Luke turned to the dark side. I even heard early rumors that they were going to have Finn find Luke's severed hand with a light saber in it. To me, it would have made the most sense to do a story where the Republic is now the political force of the Galaxy and the First Order are the rebels. Luke could have been training a new Jedi order and they could have shown a growing Sith threat, with a real villain and not the weanie in panties that we got in this movie, throughout the battles with the First Order. They could have made Hans more distinguished (after all he was a King and it's been 30 years, so he should have grown up by now). Instead, we got the same Han Solo from 1975 but who looked 40 years older and disheveled. I'm sure Harrison Ford had no intention of doing another Star Wars movie and insisted that this would be the last one. So he would have been killed off no matter what. However, it could have been far less predictable and more creative and touching. If they wanted to keep the story line they went with, then they still could have started this way and shown how Kylo Rey was turning to the dark side. Any of these would have been far better than the trash I saw tonight. It's amazing how I could think of these story lines (as I'm sure can 1000s of other Star Wars fans) but none of the so called talented writers, producers, and directors in Hollywood can do this? This simply amounts to lazy writing and oversight. CONCLUSION Because everything was so predictable and the story was a rehash of what we already saw, the movie was BORING! It's amazing how Hollywood can continue to put out movies like this, cheat their viewers, and then wonder in astonishment why everyone stays home to stream or pirate movies. Maybe it's because more and more movies these days simply support overpaid political activists whose only creative effort is to make a political statement at the expense of entertainment. I'm done with Star Wars. I don't need to see episodes VIII or IX, because I already know what is going to happen. Episode VIII and IX will be remakes of the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi with Ren as Luke, Luke as Obi Wan, and Kylo Rey as Darth Vader. I'm sure VIII will have the surprise statement by Kylo Rey when he battles Ren saying, \"Ren, I am your cousin,\" and IX will end with Ren bringing Rey to the good side with little furry creatures celebrating in tree tops and the ghosts of Luke and Han looking approvingly over the scene. Yeah, been there done that, there is no sense in my wasting money or time to do it again. Star Wars is Dead! Thanks Disney and Abrams and you politically correct whackos. Thanks a lot! A NOTE ON POSITIVE REVIEWS After reading many of the positive reviews, I can only come to the conclusion that 1/3 of them are written by hard core Star Wars fans who will rave about anything with the \"Star Wars\" logo attached to it and will refuse to their dying day that they were wrong about this movie, 1/3 by people who never saw Star Wars and accept this cheap rip off because it is the only version of the story they have seen, and 1/3 by studio hacks. The positive reviewers have also resorted to calling the negative reviewers \"Haters.\" It's amazing how convenient it is today for people to throw that word around to discredit anyone who has a differing opinion. That should tell you everything you need to know about the character and honesty of the positives reviewers.\n",
      "The new \"New hope\" dies at the hands of the Disney money-making machine There may be some spoilers, even though I have done my best to avoid them!  I am a big fan of the OT, and like many fans was disappointed by the silly prequels. I felt excited for this new trilogy, and hoped JJ Abrams was going to be able to give us new stories to propel the series forward. After the prequels, at least there was the hope of someone new coming in and renewing the sense of magic and wonder that have been the very soul of the OT. Now this hope has been extinguished. Disney has put so much effort into safely making money (a lot of it, too), from the cash cow that is Star Wars, that they have stifled any creativity that could have made this movie great.  For more detail read below : I saw the movie last night, and here are its best and worst moments. What worked:  1. Imagery - hands down, awesome visuals, but that is to be expected given how much this movie must have cost to make.  2. The new droid, BB8 is cute  3. There was no Jar Jar Binks :)  4. Some humor, still falling a bit flat of the original  5. The reunion of Han Solo and Chewbacca, those two were as great as ever What did not work (for me) 1. The weak story - practically a rehash or the \"A New Hope\" plot, but without the freshness and creativity that made the original work so well. Throughout the whole movie I had the feeling of \"been there, done that\", and ended up being bored. I mean, we are destroying the Death Star for a third time now, really? Ooooh, but this time it is bigger. And we are again hiding a secret information in a droid?. Snooze.  2.The main characters. What worked so well in the OT was they had introduced very charismatic characters and they also took the time to develop them and give us reasons to care for them. The creation of bonds of friendship and camaraderie between Han, Luke and Leia happened organically, made sense and was justified. The three new leads try to display the same, but it feels forced as nothing in the story should have lead them to feel that way about each other. I could not bring myself to are about Poe, or Rey or Finn, so not sure how they will carry the franchise forward  3. Weak villains who do not project enough danger for the Resistance. I admit, it must be hard to equal, let alone top, such awesome villains as Lord Vader or the Emperor. Still, the new villains, Supreme Commander Snoke, Kylo Ren and Hux come across as average wanna-bees and do not provide the necessary feel of dread, to make us feel threatened.  4. Weak script. I had high hopes after I learned Lawrence Kasdan was writing the script, but my hopes were unfounded. In the OT each main character was given a very compelling reason why they were involved with the rebels. For Leia, it was because of her father, Luke saw his family killed, and Han, after his initial resistance, had fallen for Leia and had come back to rescue Luke during the raid against the Death Star. In this new movie, there was no compelling reason for Finn, and ex-storm trooper, to somehow overcome being brainwashed and conditioned to kill and develop high moral principles and sense of humor. For Rey, there was no compelling reason to rescue BB8 in the desert. Poe was already with the resistance, but feeling all buddy-buddy with Finn happened all of a sudden, more because of \"well the main characters are supposed to be like that\" rather than any sense-making reason  5. No character development. I cannot believe that they had such golden opportunity to introduce the new leads who should have been these new interesting characters, and they did nothing to develop them and make us feel any sense of camaraderie with them! I mean, Finn, trying to overcome his storm trooper conditioning; Rey going from a desert scavenger to something more; Kylo Ren's insecurities, his volatility and his rivalry with Hux - all of these could have been used to give us some memorable moments, and instead were wasted.  6. Things happening too quickly and in a forced way. Remember how Luke had to train to access the Force and gain any control over it? Remember Ben Kenoby, a seasoned Jedi, using Jedi mind tricks? Well the new Jedi uses these things without any training at all, it all just happens out of nowhere  7. Musical score. The Star Wars theme is easily one of the most epic, amazing movie scores ever written. If I had not wanted to be a Jedi so bad, just the Imperial march alone would have made me join the Dark Side :))) So I was hoping we were going to get some more musical awesomeness, after all, it did happen for the sucky prequels, right? Not so here. To my disappointment, there was no awesome First Order theme, no nothing. It pains me so much to say that, because in my mind John Williams is and will remain the greatest movie composer ever\n",
      "A slightly more adult Star Wars that shows Lucas was right to let go of the series. I have never been a huge fan of the Star Wars films--especially after the last three films they made. Too often, in my opinion, the emphasis was merchandising cute characters to kids instead of making the best possible sci-fi film. Fortunately, now that George Lucas sold off the franchise, Disney actually has made a slightly darker and slightly more adult addition to the franchise...and I was thoroughly impressed. I really DON'T want to talk about the plot of \"The Force Awakens\"-- mostly because the movie just debuted and I would prefer folks experience it themselves. However, I don't think it spoils it in any way to say that the film is a bit of the old and a bit of the new. So, folks who loved the earlier films (particularly the great ones) will be happy that the film is clearly Star Wars and has a lot of similar plot elements from the earlier movies. You also get to see some familiar faces. But there also are several new ones and they seem to have a bit more depth than usual. I particularly liked Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley)--they were not just formulaic characters and you really like and respect them. The bottom line is that the film very much kept my interest and Disney seemed much more focused on story and, especially, characterization. A thoroughly enjoyable film from start to finish.\n",
      "Brilliant Special Effects and Nice Mix of the Old and New Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)  *** (out of 4)  I'm pretty sure every person on Earth know what the film is about and just in case you don't I'm not going to spoil anything here in regards to the plot. Yes, it's basically a reworking of A NEW HOPE with the old and new characters being brought together to go up against the Dark Side. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS was probably the most anticipated movie in recent memory and as no shocked it turned out to be a massive hit. I predicted when I heard that it was going to be made that it would eventually become the top grossing movie ever made. It hasn't quite reached that mark as of me writing this but I'm sure it will happen. So, we know it was a massive hit but how was the actual movie?  I'm not a major STAR WARS fan but this one here isn't nearly as good as episodes four through six. How could it be? With that said I must admit that I found the film to be extremely entertaining, which is all I was personally asking for. I thought J.J. Abrams did a very good job at building up the new characters and the new story while also keeping the original trilogy fans happy. I thought the screenplay was clever in how the old characters were brought into this new story and I won't complain about any of the events that happen in regards to the story. The special effects, as you'd expect, are spectacular and they certainly push the level in regards to what can be done today. The various space battles were tremendous to look at and best of all is that they feel 100% authentic and real. There wasn't a single battle where you didn't feel as if you were right there in the action and this is always a major plus. Another thing are that the robotic characters are all well-designed and manage to fit right in with the series. The film is full of wonderful action scenes and all of them are full of terrific atmosphere. Performance wise, against I'm not going to spoil anything major so all I will say is that the original three actors are all excellent in how they are used. The new people like Daisy Ridley, JOhn Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver all are good and I think fans have a nice cast to take this series into the future. Of course, we also have Chewbacca back, which is always fun. The film does have some flaws and I think some of it is based around the humor. The film goes for a lot of humor and I thought a lot of it didn't work all that well. Ford and Chewbacca get some nice moments together but many times the jokes fell flat. I'd also say that the film ran on a tad bit too long but the ending was so wonderful that it was fun once it came. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is really just a set-up for what's to follow and it certainly has me excited for what comes next.\n",
      "The force has awakened! Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'. Despite seeing 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' around the time it first came out (maybe a little after), there was a long time of being put off by the vitriolic hate it's gotten here and the practical war zone there is in order to review it (even when it was critically acclaimed). Finally mustering the courage, count me in as somebody who loved 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens'. A masterpiece? No. Better than the prequels? Absolutely, and although some may disagree this is saying a lot. The best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi?' Yes. 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is not the most original plot-wise. It has been criticised for being a re-hash of 'A New Hope', understandably. However, instead of being done in a cheap and slap-in-the-face way, it felt like an affectionate and nostalgic homage. Exemplified by bringing back major characters from the original trilogy in supporting roles. JJ Abrams, and this may be considered blasphemy, does a much better job here than he did with his 'Star Trek' reboot films, here he keeps the original spirit of the original trilogy intact while giving the film its own identity at the same time. While it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic at the expense of creating memorable characters, a fun story and brains and heart. The characters are memorable with easily identifiable leads, the original trilogy characters bringing a lot of affectionate nostalgia and a well executed if not iconic (not by Darth Vader standards anyhow) villain in Kylo Ren (unpredictable and dangerous but feeling he is morally justified). The story lacks originality but more than makes up for it in energy, non-stop heart-thumping thrills and excitement, generosity, a cheerfulness that is positively space operatic, vibrant charm and a few fresh twists along the way. In many ways it is a celebration of the universe while also an expansion of it. It is sometimes sentimental but never overly so, one crucial death scene is just heart-wrenching (particularly Chewbacca's reaction) and doesn't feel like a slap in the face to the character in question. Could the villains have been better written? Ren is fine but Snoke only just about works as a character thanks to the visual effects and especially the powerfully enigmatic with a touch of vulnerability performance of Andy Serkis, other than that the character is underwritten. Also felt that Gwendoline Christie's character was unnecessary, so limited was her screen time. Visually, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed with Abrams' visual storytelling shining far more here than it has in other films he's done. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films. Thank goodness that the dialogue contains little to none of the cheesiness heard in the prequels, and it even has more layers than that of the original trilogy. Acting also shines, with winning charismatic performances from John Boyega and particularly Daisy Ridley. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher still have it, while Max Von Sydow shows himself to be a master of gestures and eye contact speaking louder than words. Adam Driver is a suitably menacing Ren and Serkis makes much of his somewhat underwritten character. Oscar Isaac gives a typically strong performance. In conclusion, a great film, the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and one of the best of the saga too. 9/10 Bethany Cox\n",
      "Where to begin?! Unlike many moviegoers, I couldn't care less about the STAR WARS franchise these days. Sure, I grew up with the original trilogy, which I still know and love, but George Lucas single-handedly destroyed the goodwill surrounding those movies with his mishandling of the prequels. The good news is that THE FORCE AWAKENS - a genuine sequel to RETURN OF THE JEDI - is better than the prequels, but only just. Because this is a deeply flawed movie that gets ten things wrong for everything it gets right. While it's a delight to see Harrison Ford effortlessly breezing back into one of his most iconic roles, the rest of the production is a mixed bag of good and bad, of the woeful and the wonderful. Inevitably, the special effects are one of the strongest things here. The copious use of the CGI looks better than ever, and the alien planets involved in the story are all well realised. You can't fault the large-scale action sequences, which look great in high definition, and as a whole the film is a visual treat. A shame, then, that the story is so weak and a virtual retread of the first STAR WARS film, A NEW HOPE, made all those years ago. The new villains are laughable and Adam Driver's attempts at an iconic baddie along the lines of Darth Vader are quite pitiful. The starkiller stuff is as predictable as it gets, and you wonder why they couldn't go in a fresh and new direction instead of simply regurgitating what has come previously. The new characters don't fare very well either. John Boyega, who was so good in ATTACK THE BLOCK, struggles with a put-on American accent that rings hollow. Daisy Ridley is even worse: this newcomer seems to have overdosed on Keira Knightley performances, copying Knightley's style of acting throughout and feeling completely artificial as a result. All of her lines sound cheesy and wooden, and frankly I felt embarrassed watching her attempting to act alongside the more seasoned actors. It says something that the droid, BB-8, was my favourite of the new characters, given that his high 'cuteness' factor is a shamelessly manipulative attempt to endear him to audiences. Add in a non-ending of a film that merely opens the door for the next inevitable instalment, and you have an oddly hollow film that looks nice but falls apart as soon as you start picking at it.\n",
      "The Return of Star Wars It's over 30 years since the defeat of the empire. The Republic is threatened by the First Order led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) under the control of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). The resistance led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is fighting the Dark Side. Finn (John Boyega) is a conflicted stormtrooper. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger on the planet Jakku. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is the Resistance ace pilot. It has been over 30 years since the last truly good Star Wars movie. It is a great reboot and a solid repair job to the damage from the prequels. The biggest complaint seems to be that this is a repeat of A New Hope. If anything, this is pulling out scenes and references from all three originals. I have no problems with that. In fact, it's good to go back and take pages out of the original trilogy. Even the force is explained more in the traditional way. However, this is not a simple repeat. The new characters are tremendous. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are amazing additions. He's an interesting character and I love their initial meeting. I love him keep grabbing her hand. There are some minor problems but they're too minor to mention especially considering the spoilers. I rank 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980) the best, 'A New Hope' (1977) second, and I may squeeze 'The Force Awakens' slightly ahead of 'Return of the Jedi' (1983). Forget the prequels. P.S. In this one, nobody loses a lightsaber fight because of elevation.\n",
      "Overcomes its inherent challenges by producing a fast paced, dramatic, fun, and very enjoyable film that hits all its marks By all accounts, this film really shouldn't work as well as it does. Looking at it in the cold light of day it is essentially a repeat of the original film in terms of narrative – albeit with some details changed and all the characters moved sideways by a generation. So we have the same parent/child divide, the same innocent discovering their power, right down to the same finale with a large planet-sized weapon. Associated with this it also rides very heavily on nostalgia and brand recognition so that we probably accept a lot of plotting conveniences that we would scoff at in a film we came into cold. However, even seeing all these things, it is hard not to love it for how well it works. It does this by getting the balanced right between all the many aspects that the film seeks to pull together. So we have the nostalgia and a very familiar narrative, but at the same time we have a story that is delivered in a way that engages and is surprisingly moving at times (albeit due to that self-same nostalgia and reliance on us already being invested in this universe and the characters). It also manages to be fun but yet also able to transition into darker moments without one damaging our enjoyment of the other. This is what makes it work I think – because it is really an enjoyable film to watch. It never really stops moving, and the characters are rather thin, but within this frame they work and are engaging. The cast are a big part of that, and it is a very well-cast piece given that the new faces are not dominated by the old familiar ones. Boyega makes good on that charisma he showed when playing the lead in Attach the Block, while Ridley is really natural and likable. For all the fuss over a black storm trooper and a female 'Luke', the truth is that both do a great job regardless of race/color – but do bring that extra factor into play (I had a daughter recently, and it did rather focus my mind on the deficient of strong female characters who are played for themselves, not for their sexuality). The cast is deep in familiar faces and really everyone is on good form – Fisher perhaps seems there because she has to be, but it was nice to see Ford manage to have a bit of a twinkle back in his eyes. The volume of familiar faces in tiny roles does get a bit distracting (particularly if you have watched any shows from Abrams and know his usual cast) but this is a minor thing since the film otherwise does a very good job of keeping you with it for all its adventure and fun. Such a hyped film with such weight on its shoulders really shouldn't be able to be so light on its feet while also delivering dramatic and emotional moments, but it does. A really enjoyable Star Wars film that delivers a lot – and regardless what George Lucas thinks, it has been a very long time since that was the case.\n",
      "Give the Sensation of Déjà Vu Thirty years after the fall of the Galactic Empire, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is vanished and there is a new threat to the Republic: The First Order under the command of the Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). General Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the Resistance has sent her best pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) to the planet Jakku to get a map with the location of her brother. However, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the Stormtroopers destroy the village and Poe hides the map in his droid BB- 8 before he is captured. Ren wants to kill the last Jedi and needs to know his whereabouts. But the Stormtrooper FN-2187 (John Boyega) saves Poe and flees with him in a TIE fighter. Poe calls him Finn, but they crash on Jakku and Finn survives while Poe disappears. Meanwhile the scavenger teenager Rey (Daisy Ridley) finds BB-8 and brings him to the trade camp. But Ren discovered that BB-8 has the map and attacks Jakku. However Rey, Finn and BB-8 steal the Millennium Falcon that is left in a junkyard and escape from Jakku. When the spacecraft breaks down in space, they meet Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca. They have an incident with gangs but they succeed to go to the Resistance base, but Rey is captured by Ren. But the Resistance learns that the huge Starkiller Base is powering a weapon to destroy their planet and now their only chance to destroy the weapon depends on Han Solo, Chewbacca and Finn that wants to save Rey.  All the fans had great expectations with \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\", but the film has an unoriginal story. The franchise is orphan of George Lucas and the new writers were not able to create anything new. The Death Star is replaced by the Starkiller Base. Darth Vader, the father of Luke Skywalker, is replaced by Kylo Ren, the son of Han Solo and Leia. R2-D2 is replaced by BB-8. Senator Palpatine, or Darth Sidious, is replaced by the Supreme Leader Snoke. The destruction of the weapon depends of the explosion of the power generator. There are so many similarities in the story of \"The Force Awakens\" with the other episodes that gives the sensation of déjà vu. In addition, the characters are poorly developed. All good things should come to an end, but greed is the root of all evil. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): \"Star Wars: O Despertar da Força\" (\"Star Wars: The Awekening of the Force\")\n",
      "On par with the old films Now the title of this review is probably the ultimate compliment when it comes to huge Star wars fans out there. Unfortunately I am not one of them. I liked the old films and I liked this new movie here just as much, without considering either to be groundbreaking or some other superlative. This new movie runs for 2 hours and 15 minutes and was written and directed by J.J. Abrams, who is mostly known for \"Lost\" and \"Star Trek\". It is the ultimate breakthrough movie for John Boyega, but even more so Daisy Ridley. And while I liked the latter, I thought that it was so nice to see Oscar Isaac as usual. Cool reunion also from \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" with Adam Driver here, even if the two had no scenes together. Fans of the old \"Star Wars\" film will appreciate the inclusion of Harrison Ford, who has lots of screen time, Carrie Fisher, who has solid screen time, and Mark Hamill, who has almost no screen time, but it is indicated that he will make a much bigger impact in the next film. This new \"Star Wars\" film managed no less than five Academy Award nominations, all in the technical categories and this also describes the film perfectly. Yes there are some interesting plot developments and characters, but it's really all about the technical side. Music, effects, editing etc. are all really good. The acting is mostly fine, but nothing to rave about. This does also include Harrison Ford, who has a truly baity supporting role here and I am a bit shocked he got no awards attention for his turn here. He and Driver also share the most dramatic and emotionally crucial scene of the film during their interaction on a bridge. Oh yeah and let us not forget about the light saber action scenes. These are truly cool to watch, no denying. There are a couple more famous names included here and the one I want to mention as well is Domhnall Gleeson, who is having an amazing year with all the films he is in. Finally, I also liked the little robot and Chewbacca of course, who bring some solid comic relief, certainly more than most of the \"human\" characters' one-liners that weren't as funny as they were intended to be. All in all, this film was pretty much what I expected. Great action and impressive visually (check it out on the big screen), but not really convincing in terms of story and character development. The financial success does not come surprising at all though. The brand is obviously as much in demand as always. I believe it was a good watch and if you like science fiction more than I do, you will probably have an even better watch and appreciate this film even more than I did. This does not say, of course, that I did not like it. On the contrary, I had a pretty good times and it's certainly an achievement for a film with that runtime that I almost never felt it dragged. Thumbs up and nice cliffhanger ending too. I will certainly watch the next one as well.\n",
      "An Impressive Blockbuster Film...That Said I saw Quentin Tarentino on Stephen Colbert the other night. He pointed out that no matter what movie he's gone to, he always remembers that it is still a movie...that he never falls into the spell to where he forgets. People say they do. He doesn't. I deliberately stayed away from any reviews or comments on this film. But I couldn't avoid all of the hype and that hype, by its very nature, made me constantly aware I was watching a movie that was going to make huge sums of money. I'm having trouble separating myself from that sense of \"why did they do this?\" And \"why did they choose her.\" And, \"Isn't Harrison Ford a stitch.\" Not Han Solo but Harrison Ford. Anyway, I have to admit that I sort of enjoyed it. It has lots of action, some interesting characters, a nostalgic feel, and so on. And a force is a force of course, of course. I skipped work so I could be at the first screening of the first \"Star Wars\" film back in 1977. I have to admit that as a reader of much challenging science fiction, I found the whole thing pretty bland. But it is a cultural entity, it bears watching. I don't know that there was much new here that would make one want badly to come back for more. When I saw the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, I marked my calendar, hoping I would live to see all three episodes. And in that one, I already knew the plot. I'll be interested to see how this holds up to the test of time. For me the second set of the films are quite forgettable. And, again, for me, only one of the original caught my interest.\n",
      "Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens Disney paid over $4 billion to buy Lucasfilm, George Lucas himself served as creative consultant, I was super excited about a new movie, and the original stars returning, it was just a question of whether the acquisition was worth it, forget the prequels (no Jar Jar Binks), directed by J.J. Abrams (Lost, Mission: Impossible III, Star Trek, Super 8). Basically it's been 30 years since the destruction of the second Death Star, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last Jedi, has disappeared, the remains of the fallen Galactic Empire have risen and become The First Order, seeking to eliminate Skywalker and the Republic, the Resistance, backed by the Republic, are led by Luke's sister, Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), opposing the First Order and searching for Luke. On the planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) obtains a map to Luke's location from village elder Lor San Tekka (Max von Sydow), Stormtroopers, commanded by Kylo Ren (What If's Adam Driver), destroy the village and capture Poe, his droid BB-8 escapes with the map, and comes across scavenger Rey (introducing Daisy Ridley) at a junkyard settlement. The First Order Stormtrooper FN-2187 (Attack the Block's John Boyega) is unable to kill, gets away, frees Poe and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter, Poe gives him the new name \"Finn\". Poe and Finn crash on Jakku, Finn appears to be the only survivor, he finds Rey and BB-8 in the village, the First Order find them and attack, the three flee the planet in the stolen, rundown Millennium Falcon. Following a chase and escape, the Falcon breaks down and is captured by a larger ship, piloted by Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew and Joonas Suotamo), they reclaim their former ship, finding Rey and Finn, Han explains that Luke tried to rebuild the Jedi Order, but a student turned to the Dark Side, Luke went into exile and all he built was destroyed. The five escape on the Falcon when attacked by criminal gangs, the gangs inform the First Order of Han's involvement, the Falcon lands on the planet Takodana, the group meet cantina owner Maz Kanata (12 Years a Slave's Lupita Nyong'o), who can help BB-8 reach the Resistance, Rey finds Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, it also belonged to his father Anakin. The First Order have converted a planet into a superweapon capable of destroying star systems, Starkiller Base, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) orders General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) to use the weapon for the first time to destroy the Republic capital and its fleet, Snoke tells Ren he must kill his father, Han Solo. Takodana is attacked by the First Order, Finn uses the lightsaber in a fight, Resistance X-wing fighters save Finn, Han and Chewbacca, they are led by Poe, but Rey is captured and taken to Starkiller Base, she resists Ren's interrogation and mind-reading, and Rey discovers her powers of the Force, using a Jedi mind trick to escape her cell. Han, Chewbacca, Finn and BB-8 meet Leia at the Resistance base on D'Qar, droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) explains that R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) has been inactive since Luke's disappearance, the group learn that BB- 8's map to Luke's location is incomplete. The Resistance plan to lower the planetary shield of Starkiller Base, before it will fire on D'Qar, so the fighters can attack, Leia asks Han to bring their son back alive; Han, Chewbacca and Finn infiltrate the base in the Falcon, the shield is lowered and Rey is found, and explosives are set. They encounter Ren, Han confronts him, using his birth name Ben, and implores him to turn from the Dark Side, but Ren kills his father Han, Chewbacca shoots Ren and sets off the explosives, the Resistance X-wing fighters therefore attack the weapon and the Starkiller Base is destroyed in a chain reaction. Injured Ren chases Finn and Rey to the surface, Finn is injured in a fight using the lightsaber, Rey takes it and overpowers Ren, who is wounded, they are finally separated by the ground crumbling, Snoke orders General Hux to evacuate and bring Ren to him, while Rey, Chewbacca and Finn escape in the Falcon. The Resistance celebrate victory on On D'Qar, but Leia, Chewbacca and Rey mourn Han's death, R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, Rey follows this to an island on a distant planet, and there she finds Luke Skywalker, offering him his lightsaber. Also starring Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma, Simon Pegg as Unkar Plutt, Tim Rose as Admiral Ackbar (voiced by Erik Bauersfeld), Pip Torrens as Colonel Kaplan, Rocky Marshall as Colonel Datoo, Heroes' Greg Grunberg as Snap Wexley, The Raid's Yayan Ruhian as Tasu Leech, Sebastian Armesto as Lieutenant Mitaka, Warwick Davis as Wollivan, Saw's Ken Leung as Admiral Statura, The Raid's Iko Uwais as Razoo Quin-Fee, 30 Rock's Judah Friedlander as Bar Patron, Thomas Brodie-Sangster as First Order Officer, Bill Hader as BB-8 Voice Consultants, Daniel Craig as Stormtrooper JB-007 and Ewan McGregor as the voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Ford, Fisher and Hamill returning makes the nostalgia all the more fun, newcomers Ridley and Boyega are fantastic talents, and Driver a great choice for villain, supporting cast members do great as well. I was hoping the feel of the fantastic originals would be reignited, I'm happy to say it met all my expectations, the story is well written and played out, the chase and fight sequences are highly exciting, and the special effects are amazing, this truly is a return to the good old days and I cannot wait for the next, a brilliant science-fiction fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Williams, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Production Design, Best Original Music and Best Sound. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Outstanding!\n",
      "this is pretty much what I expected It was inevitable that they were going to milk the franchise long after the story assumed to be done. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" brings back the characters from episodes 4-6 and adds some new ones. Given the frequent one-liners and self-references, I get the feeling that the aim is to make all the nerds/geeks have fun. I will say that unlike \"The Phantom Menace\", I understood the plot this time; with the former, I didn't understand the plot until I listened to \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's song \"The Saga Begins\" (a parody of \"American Pie\"). So, it's no masterpiece. The plot is mainly two hours of light saber fighting and shooting lasers. Basically, if you go in expecting nothing more than stuff that's meant to appeal to the characters on \"The Big Bang Theory\", then you won't be disappointed. If anything important came out of the movie, I'd say that it's Carrie Fisher's shutting down of people who have nothing better to do than comment on her age. That's all that I have to say about this movie.\n",
      "good news, it's a Star Wars movie. bad news... not too much (but some) So the good news to report first is that J.J. Abrams is someone who loves Star Wars enough that he more than respects the mythology, which itself is cobbled together from past mythological stories, both old (back to the Greeks with the Gods) and modern (serials and comics), but also recognizes that in this 'Episode' series as a saga a lot of it has to come back to family. The Force Awakens works tremendously when it focuses on the two (maybe three) new characters who are introduced in this series, and the familiar is both welcome and sometimes questionable, but mostly welcome all the same. It's a movie made for the fans, but it's not necessarily a \"fan-film\", if that makes sense. It's the logical progression of this franchise in 2015 and by a filmmaker like Abrams it's a commendable effort (if not great, read on for more, and of course SPOILERS be ahead). First of all, the first act of this movie is magnificent. New heroes are introduced, one of which, a deflecting Stormtrooper for the newly formed First Order named Finn (though it's technically not his real name, and oddly enough his given name is an in-joke for ANH fans), is remarkable. I loved this character as someone who did seem like a new presence - not someone who is a space pirate or destined for something greater, just a guy who was raised to do just one thing and has a conscience and decides to act on it. As played by John Boyega he's the best part of the movie overall for me (yes, even with mother-f***ing Han Solo and the new cute droid BB8 included), and he gives Finn passion and fire and occasional humor but is a fully formed character; he's fulfilling the promise seen in him in Attack the Block, and I can't wait to see more of his character in the next episodes. Likewise Daisy Ridley, a new actress relatively, is very good as Rey - though she at first is another character (or I should say archetype) that's familiar via Joseph Campbell as the Hero Destined for a Journey, Ridley gives her spunk and equal fire to Boyega, and it's a joy to see how they meet and join forces in the first act. Everything about this opening is so strong, a lot of it told without dialog (and when it does come in it feels simple but just right somehow) that it's a shame that the rest of the film doesn't quite live up. And it's not that the quality jumps off a cliff, but, for me, this first act of shaping this new world, the new evils (Adam Driver as the new sort of \"Darth\" Kylo Ren), hits its high point once Han Solo (Harrison Ford, acting like he'd never left the role, he's just there) and Chewbacca come in to the picture. In a way the 'spine' of the movie, in other words the events that lead everyone from point A to B to C, are really close to that of A New Hope. At the same time, I got the feeling like Abrams, probably knowing this would be his only shot at making a Star Wars movie (whether he wants to do one again is his call, but I believe he's declined), has put EVERYTHING he'd want to do in a SW movie in one film. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and Abrams passion for thios world comes through in almost every frame. But it almost feels a little cramped by the time the last act comes around and as our heroes face off against Kylo Ren (following the death of a pretty damn prominent character, sort of in keeping with the family-tragedy line of the series, I can't even bring myself to say it), there's the \"Starkiller\" Base, which is basically the Death Star on steroids. It's a much darker film than I expected. Matter of fact, the third act has the sort of pacing issues to the point I almost forgot about the Starkiller Base plan, and it had not really much urgency considering its level of threat. It's also a little unclear just how FAST a particular character gets Jedi-Force powers (the explanation of Rey having them is fine, but it seems like just how quickly is too much, as if she would need more, say, training to do ALL that she does, and comes off more like a story contrivance). And by the time it gets to this section of the film, where emotions are really high but callbacks are still done - even to things like, say, a trash compactor, or an Admiral Ackbar appearance - it's a bit much. The number of gripes that I can ponder over are many... and yet I still recommend the film highly. For all the little faults in the storytelling or little bits of deus ex machina (at one point involving a split in the ground that separates two characters in a dual at just the right moment), this is a full-bloodied, extremely well directed, shot with fire in the cinematographer's cortex (and a lack of unnecessary lens flares!) Star Wars movie. In the ways that ultimately count, in the spine as I mentioned, its familiarity is in keeping with how this saga has been unfolding over six films, with familial bonds and the mystical element of the Force guiding things in directions of good and/vs evil. It does what the 2009 Star Trek film, also from Abrams, did so well: reintroduce us to this universe with energy and spunk, give fans and newcomers what they want, and allow some new actors to act their buts off while giving veterans a chance to shine. Oh, and BB8 is cute as a button. If only R2 had more screen time for them as a buddy-droid team...\n",
      "looks like a lot of people really hated it Somehow, even with all the hatred, Star Wars: The Force Awakens managed to bring in 2 billion.  Obviously the box office is no indication of whether or not a movie is good. The appeal was the reuniting of the original cast - Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Luke Hamill, along with Chewie and 3CPO, and to introduce some new characters to carry on in the next films. I have to admit, it looked like a big video game to me. What I enjoyed the most was Ford, particularly his repartee with Chewy. For me, it was great to see Fisher and Hamill again. These films that take place in space are yesterday's westerns and war movies. It used to be the science fiction films, the Buck Rogers, Superman, Dick Tracy etc., were B movies. Once the computer and CGI came in, they quickly became A films, perfect for the big screen.  Someone once told me that most movies are made for 15-year-old boys in Thailand. It makes sense - I mean, what was there to grasp about this film that a 15-year-old non-English speaking person couldn't grasp?  I haven't followed this franchise much since the first three films, though I did see the Anakin Skywalker-Natalie Portman movie. I think it's fairly obvious that this film brings us back to the original Star Wars.  Harrison Ford was paid $10,000 for the first Star Wars. His salary is higher now and he has a percentage of the box office. He's old, he looks old, but you can't beat him. He's an old-fashioned movie star in an old-fashioned movie. I didn't feel that Carrie Fisher had enough to do though I enjoyed her. So why give this an 8? Why? It was fun, it was entertaining, I loved the original stars. The new people -- Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac are all attractive and are very good. Will I go and see the next Star Wars? Probably, because Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are in it and somehow, so is Harrison Ford. That to me is Star Wars.\n",
      "The search for Skywalker Thirty years after the destruction of the second Death Star and the overthrow of the Empire a new force has risen from its ashes; the First Order. Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, has disappeared and both the First Order and rebels, who are now known as The Resistance are searching for him. A map to his location has been found and given to rebel pilot Poe Dameron but the First Order's storm troopers attack before he can get it back to the resistance",
      " he gives the map to his droid, BB-8, and tells it to get far away. Dameron is captured buy the sinister Kylo Ren but is helped to escape by defecting storm trooper FN-2187, soon renamed Finn. Their flight doesn't get them far though; they crash and it looks as though Dameron is dead. Meanwhile BB-8 is found by a scavenger named Rey; she shortly meets with Finn and, thinking he is in the resistance they manage to escape in a familiar ship. Their journey to the resistance base will bring them into contact with some familiar characters and into many life of death situations. We also learn why Luke has disappeared and the connection between Kylo Ren and the central trio from the original 'Star Wars' films. Anybody who has seen the original 'Star Wars' film will find the plot of this film very similar; this may be a problem for some viewers but I found myself really enjoying this and think it was probably the best film in the series since 'The Empire Strikes Back'",
      " it is helped by the lack of things like Ewoks and Jar Jar Binks! The new characters were pretty impressive, in particular Rey and Finn. Their characters developed nicely through the film; this was particularly true of Rey as she starts to discover her strength in using The Force; thankfully the writers didn't rush to explain why she was so strong; no doubt we'll learn in later films. It was great to see many original characters even though Luke's appearance can best be described as a cameo or even a teaser as to what is to come in episode eight. While the overall story doesn't feature any major twists there is one very surprising moment for those who have managed to avoid spoilers. The cast does a solid job; newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega were great as Rey and Finn and of the original cast members Harrison Ford stands out as he has the most prominent role. The film features plenty of exciting action as some humorous moments which thankfully don't feel too forced. Overall I really enjoyed this film and heartily recommend it to fans of the original films.\n",
      "\"This is not how I thought the day was gonna go.\" I've taken my time getting to this review, having seen the movie twice and allowing nearly three thousand other reviewers take their shot at the picture. I have mixed feelings about \"The Force Awakens\". As a stand alone movie I think it works well enough. It's got the CGI enhanced battle action down pat and the new characters add some fresh blood to the Star Wars universe which most of us expected. This is where I think I'll insert the 'but'..... To quote Han Solo from my summary line above - \"This is not how I thought the day was gonna go.\" Another way to say it is - \"Where was the magic\"? I think I probably speak for anyone old enough to have been around for the original \"Star Wars\" in 1977. The first time you saw a land cruiser, or a hologram image of Princess Leia, or walked into the Mos Eisley cantina - man, that was magic. The legend of Obi Wan Kenobi had a mystery to it and you couldn't wait for that mystery to reveal itself. With this movie, it doesn't feel like the principals involved were interested in exploring a distant galaxy far, far away, instead directing their energy to the land of here and now. There wasn't so much a story here as the next evolution in computer generated special effects and characters created to appeal to a diverse cross section of movie goers. All well and good, but I think most Star Wars fans would welcome some serious character development and a story arc that anticipates an eventful wind up to the Star Wars saga. I don't expect that we'll get that now. Here's the one thing that did intrigue me out of the whole movie though, and I haven't read anyone else comment on it. When Han Solo follows Kylo Ren out to the bridge of the Star Killer base, he shouts out 'BEN' to which his son responds. See, this is the magic I was talking about earlier. It sounded to me like Kylo Ren was named after Ben Kenobi. If only the rest of the story could have been that cool.\n",
      "The Seventh Awakens Although if you either dismiss Episode 1-3 it could also be \"the fourth Awakens\". But back to this one and let me begin with, that I'm not even close to being in the top of the biggest fans, when it comes to Star Wars. I came late to the party and enjoyed the movies (some more, some less) and am not obsessed with the whole thing. Always liked Han Solo, especially the way Ford portrayed him. Having said that and not being able to be too detailed on every little inside joke, I can tell you that this feels like a Star Wars movie to me. Maybe it's on the surface and maybe some feel it is even too close to the Originals (copying certain things, paying respect as others would describe it). It's just the beginning of a new trilogy and 2016 has another Star Wars movie lined up, that is more of a spin off. So to see what the repercussions are (for surviving characters), you'll have to wait until 2017. As it is and as cliché as some things go down (like our main \"bad guy\" here, so misunderstood as he would possibly say himself) and as predictable as others are, you will have a couple of wow moments and giving the new female lead some power to be doing stuff rather than just being there, this has a lot going for it. Maybe not the best Star Wars movie out there and interestingly enough the reaction was either love or hate (do people really think of this being worse than Episode 1? Wow). Embrace it for what it is, because it does capture what George Lucas was trying to do back in the day ...\n",
      "Pleasant and entertaining throwback to the 1970s Star Wars movies. My wife and I enjoyed this at home on DVD from our local public library. JJ Abrams did a good job directing this movie mostly in the style of the original Star Wars movies beginning in 1977. I've been around long enough to remember them well and the positive stir they created. I had a good friend who became a giant fan of the robot C3PO, who also makes an appearance here, 38 years after the original. Most of the running time and action involve a set of new, mostly younger actors. The bad guys want to control the galaxy (far, far away) and part of their plan is to find and eliminate Luke Skywalker, believed to be hidden away in a remote location. A map, stored on a solid state device, is the key. For me the most fun was their bringing back the main actors (and their characters) from the originals. Harrison Ford, who was in his 30s when all this started, is now in his 70s as Han Solo. His old ship, the Millennium Falcon relegated to a junkyard, serves a key role in the battles and as an escape vehicle.  Mark Hamill is back as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher is back as Princess Leia who has become a general, and Peter Mayhew, all 7 feet and 3 inches of him, is back as Chewbacca. Good movie and very entertaining, we enjoyed it. SPOILERS: Solo and Leia have a son, who has inherited some of his grandfather's (Darth Vader) powers is also leading the effort of the bad guys. There is a confrontation between him and Solo, where dad is trying to talk him into abandoning the dark side, but the son puts his lightsaber through Han who apparently then falls to his death.\n",
      "Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a good continuation of the series as it left off from 30 years ago As someone who grew up watching the original trilogy (that's the ones from '77-'83 that starred Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher), I was a little stoked to watch this one with those three returning. Ford appears the most in this and he makes the most of his presence. The funniest lines are from him and it's such a joy when he's on screen. Ms. Fisher doesn't seem as charismatic as in her previous stints as Leia but she's still pretty good at what she's required being now an older version of her. She and Ford have some nice scenes together. Hamill doesn't appear much so we'll have to wait for the next one in the series to see how he fares though I did like his beard at the end. The new players, mainly Finn and Rey, are good enough as characters. J.J. Abrams does a good enough job taking over for George Lucas. This was quite exciting for me and my movie theatre-working friend. So on that note, I recommend Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\n",
      "Episode VIII had better be fantastic. A fairly long time ago, in a county not so far away (Elstree Studios are an hour's drive away from yours truly), a great adventure took place. Now, J.J. Abrams, in league with the 'House of Mouse', has returned to make a seventh chapter in the franchise, and it's almost identical in plot to the first film, but with only a fraction of the magic and charm. Daisy Ridley plays Luke",

I've learnt to keep my expectations low for Star Wars films since The Phantom Menace, so I can't say The Force Awakens was a massive disappointment; it is what I feared it would be—a rather safe reboot, lacking in fresh ideas, which aims to please younger viewers with flashy visuals, whilst pandering to the older generation by including sly nods to the original trilogy. Personally, I would much rather they had taken a bolder approach: let's be honest",
      " they couldn't have got it any more wrong than the prequels. There's a spark of originality in the form of Finn (John Boyega), a stormtrooper who has a change of heart and joins the rebellion, the production design and effects are incredible, and I admit that the return of Han Solo and Chewbacca warmed even my cynical heart, but on the whole I was left wanting by this latest instalment, particularly the final assault on the Starkiller Base, which was completely bereft of tension. In fact, my favourite moment of the whole film is when Carrie Fisher tries to convey anguish, but her plastic surgery doesn't let her.\n",
      "Luke rewrites Matthew This is a replacement comment for the one written on opening night. I've had a chance to see it again, this time in 3D, and of course think about it. The big picture here is that the creative team made a modern film in the sense that it is folded, meaning it is about itself and how it presents other films. There are hundreds of examples of this of course, but this is the biggest movie in history, so something important is going on. In thousands of comments here, I've remarked on this new development, where more and more films have introspective dynamics. We are changing how we think, managing thoughts on at least two levels: the story and the story about the story, or how the story is presented. There is real power in this, because such introspection is a half step away from seeing yourself while being yourself, and that is half a step away from what might be called living the force. An example: the story in this film had to recycle elements from the previous ones (actually just the first two). What is our heroine about but literally scavenging elements from the prior films? Throughout, the term 'scavenger' is used as an insult but Rey carries it proudly. She clearly knows something about herself we don't. Our first scene with her matters. We have been transported with captured Poe into the hanger bay of a star destroyer, which Poe finds impressive. Immediately after, we have Rey rappelling into an identical bay from the last Star Wars saga. She will later fly through this and other parts of that wreckage.  About the handling of space. Other than story details, this had to have been much chewed over, because since the original films, our conventions of what a camera is have changed. The original two films were themselves intended to be retro in how they handled the camera. In 1977, the techniques attributed to Hitchcock and Welles were common, where the camera was no longer passive. It became our representative in the film, subtly indicating what we would do if we were there, or what role we would play. The camera could be curious, for instance, show revulsion or fascination. Lucas chose to have the camera be as it was in the 40's. This is one reason dePalma and Coppola thought the movie stunk. But that and the practical effects worked for us, indeed became part of what we loved. Now flash forward to a time where no action movie can be made without the active camera, the camera as our representative. What balance does Abrams find, but to have two film philosophies interwoven. In all the 'character' scenes, the effects are mostly practical and the camera is retro. In all the action scenes, the effects are mostly GCI and the camera is the modern one. The difference is striking because Lucas used a 1930 Howard Hughes dogfight movie as his template for the space battles. Here we still have spacecraft moving as if they were biplanes moving fast, but the weaves among them and among the camera are modern. (This was pioneered by Pixar, and their direct influence is obvious in the 3D version.) One final observation on the story reflecting the film itself. When Lucas and Kurtz invented the characters for the first film, they paid a lot of attention to archetypes. Most commonly cited is the work of Joseph Campbell but they more deeply studied the most popular of these, the Jesus story. (They didn't mention this for obvious reasons.) Think of Mark as history and each of the following gospels as episodes that added to the story. Mark (without the later ending) is about a preacher of parables with no special birth and no resurrection. Matthew in the next episode adds a virgin birth, influence from Persia and Egypt (then considered magical) and rising from the dead. Where Mark had him in the Nazarene desert, Matthew brought him into cosmic battle. The third episode written as 'history' emphasized Jesus role in building an order of followers, whose collective adherence to (lets call it) the force will sweep over the planet and redeem it. The devil appears here with his own order, the 'first order' chronologically created. One might assume that the name Luke Skywalker was random, or that it mirrored Lucas' name. But this is not the case, and this is something Kasdan understood. All he did was give us the Jesus story filtered through Kurosawa. Why mention this? Because Kasdan is again on the case and what he does is metaphorically overlay Luke on Matthew, giving us both.\n",
      "Finally...the Force awakens! Acclaimed J.J. Abrams directs and co-writes this STAR WARS installment. I remember watching the original with my best friend in 1977 and agreed this is a spectacle. What a hallowed franchise it has become. Although not being a faithful follower, my perspective of THE FORCE AWAKENS probably will leave a lot to be desired. Three decades have passed since the last episode had Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill)decide to hideout on a small mountainous island. Harrison Ford returns as a matured, and yet still charming, Hans Solo. Time as not served Leia(Carrie Fisher)well, although now the princess is a general who leads the Resistance. Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew)is still one of the most likable sidekicks ever. C3PO and R2D2 still look the same. Two likable characters will more than earn their entry into the franchise; John Boyega(Finn)is an AWOL stormtrooper, who meets a beautiful scavenger named Rey(Daisy Ridley), who has crafty skills equal to the best of any fighter. Poe Dameron(Oscar Issac)is a devoted pilot of the Resistance working for Leia. And a new malevolence, the First Order, spawns from the ruins of the Empire. FX are definitely special in the grand fashion one would expect. So much frantic action it is hard to find a place to sneak away for popcorn or soft drink refills. The detractors of this movie will be, of course, way out numbered by the serious Star Wars fanatics. The story line not exactly simple; but sustains the free thinkers with wide open imagination. Others in this cast of hundreds(maybe thousands): Max von Sydow, Adam Driver, Gwendoline Christie, Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyongo, Nick Walters, Dante Briggins, Dombhnall Gleeson and even Daniel Craig plays a stormtrooper. This movie proves to be one not to be missed. You don't even have to be a Star Wars fan. And definitely worth watching more than once.\n",
      "The next generation Star Wars is Fan-Tastic! One can only have deep respect and admiration for a genius individual like J.J. Abrams",
      " I think one of the most difficult things to accomplish in the film industry is to revive a legendary and immeasurably popular franchise, but Abrams achieved in doing so not just once – with \"Star Trek\" – but now twice, with the even more astounding new \"Star Wars\" installment. \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\" aren't just your average type of successful Sci-Fi movies, no, they became so humongous that they became immortal cult phenomena with millions of obsessive fans, countless of spin-offs and imitations and merchandising business that started to lead a life of their own. In order to appeal to this many skeptical and demanding fans, your film just has to be really, REALLY good! \"Episode VII: The Force Awakens\" is a fantastic film, and even though I'm not an avid \"Star Wars\" admirer, it was the first one since \"The Empire Strikes Back\" that truly impressed and overwhelmed me. Episodes I, II and III, that were released between 1999 and 2005 and directed by George Lucas himself, were not exactly worshiped by the die-hard SW-fans. Arguably that's because Mr. Lucas wrote and directed the prequels from a creator's point of view and not enough from a fan-boy's perspective. Abrams clearly is a big fan of the saga and probably knows more about Lucas' creation than he does himself, and that makes him the ideal person to helm the next generation of Star Wars cinema. \"The Force Awakens\" has a solid and absorbing scenario, breathtaking decors and set-pieces, spectacular action scenes (brought to an even higher level of awesomeness thanks to the exquisite 3D) and – perhaps the most important of all – a truly excellent and versatile cast of characters. First and foremost there's the return of some legendary heroes, of course, like Han Solo and Chewbacca, but also the newly introduced protagonists are fascinating characters. Personally, I've always been most attracted to the Dark Side, so I adored the new and powerful foe Kylo Ren (and particularly his private mental battle), the relentless army General Hux and the rather disturbing Supreme Leader Snoke. But also the good guys are extremely likable, like tough girl Rey and the reshaped Stormtrooper Finn. I can't wait for episodes 8 and 9!\n",
      "Slumber Earthquake. There really is no point trying to do an in depth review of this, it falls in line with a number of series blockbusters that are guaranteed to garner rabid responses, pro and con.  The Force Awakens is a film of many flaws, it has a pungent whiff of safeness about it, the charges of it being a glitzy remake are fair enough, while certain plot strands are frustrating and set to be big talking points for years - and years - to come. Yet what about its worth to someone who is not obsessed with every finer detail? Someone who just loves the Star Wars universe as a spectacle prism of entertainment, and has just wanted a Star Wars film worthy of being fit to sit alongside that original trilogy? This made me feel 11 again, took me back to a time in 1977 when I queued for three hours to see such wonders on the big screen. The Force Awakens is, in spite of the recognised flaws, a loving homage to a past love. It's sly with humour and nods to foundations, a blitzkrieg of effects and sound work (my Blu-ray viewing had my sub-woofer doing a jitterbug in the lounge), and it doesn't shy from surprise or the dangling of the carrot. The makers have big heart and technical invention, the cast vibrant, spunky and strongly committed to the cause - the old hands a very reassuring presence - Yeah, so it's not sci-fi perfection, or any Star Wars geeks' idea of the perfect Star Wars movie (oh J.J. Abrams you devil you!), but it made this middle aged guy shed a tear of happiness. A moment to reaffirm why - as a young lad - I fell in love with film in the first place. 9/10\n",
      "A Star Wars Reunion Movie The release of Star Wars this year is definitely going provide a lot of excitement especially for the people who have been given a lot of entertainment and enjoyment by series of movie that have been released in the 70's,80's and 90's. But this time,a lot of the fans are highly anticipating this movie because it will definitely the stars from the first installment of the Star Wars trilogy that are appearing like Harrison Ford,Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher.It will be sort of a like a reunion movie especially since the last movie that they have made was more than 30 years ago. Star Wars: The Force Awakens which is also known as Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens will take off thirty years after the events that occurred after Star Wars: Episode VI -The Return Of The Jedi.The First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to eliminate the New Republic which is backed by The Resistance,which is led by General Leia Organa.She opposes them and starts to search for her twin brother to enlist his aid.The story progresses with General Leia's search for Luke Skywalker. Well,it was an enjoyable movie.No question about it.We are treated to better cinematic effects and better production values especially with Disney in charge of this trilogy.Added to that,we are also treated to great storytelling that would definitely reignite the fans' enjoyment of the up-and-coming series.Although I must say that we are going to be treated to the same formula which have made it successful and it would not be something new which many disappointed fans expected,it was still a great joy to see something updated for the modern audiences and done successfully.Personally,I think that there is no need to change the formula for as the saying goes,\"Why fix it if it ain't broke?\"\n",
      "A new hype 1977 was a big year in the cinema. Star Wars (later titled Episode IV-A New Hope) came out. It was a big year for me as well. I went to see my first James Bond film in the cinema. Star Wars I saw some years later on television, which as my brother said 20 minutes in. It is just some characters walking in the desert. JJ Abrams who ran out of ideas by the time he went on to direct Star Trek: Into Darkness has not waited long to reuse old ideas for Star Wars 7. Just as Creed carries on the Rocky saga by going back to Rocky 1 &amp; 2, Abrams with Lawrence Kasdan &amp; Michael Arndt has gone back to A New Hope to set up this new trilogy. We are back to the world of Star Wars and with advances in technology, special effects, CGI and animatronics we have not advanced much in visuals from the original trilogy which is over 30 years old from The Return of the Jedi. The visuals are uninspired and rather lazy. We have a Tattooine like planet where a young woman, Rey meets a droid carrying important information regarding Luke Skywalker. Rey comes across Finn a storm-trooper who has had a reawakening of his own and met a rebel fighter to escape. Rey seems to be feeling the force and in a series of coincidences or I guess the power of the force escapes her pursuers in a wreck which turns out to be the Millennium Falcon and later comes across Han Solo and Chewbacca. That is not all the Darth Vader like baddie is the grandson of Darth Vader, the son of Han and Princess Leia who has gone over to the dark side but still conflicted with the power of good. Their will be a father and son reunion and you can all guess how this will turn out as the scene is reminiscent of when Obi Wan encountered Darth Vader. It is entertaining, they put on all the right beats with action scenes coming at the right time and some humour, star cameos such as Daniel Craig voicing a storm-trooper or an actress, Harriet Walter who is the niece of Christopher Lee. It is just the story has been recycled and you think that after 30 years, this is the best they could do? If Lucas wanted a new trilogy he might has well remastered and re- edited his original trilogy because I know where this is heading.\n",
      "The best episode since the original trilogy (This review contains a SPOILER at the end!) I watched it last Saturday at TGV Cinema, Cyberjaya. To me, being a Star Wars fan since childhood (I was 4 when I watched the original Star Wars in 1978) this episode brought my childhood back during the 2 hour plus duration (unlike the prequel trilogy!). All the favourites were there: Han Solo, Leia, Chewie, Luke, R2-D2, C3-PO, etc. And the new cast were great as well. It had it all - exciting battles and lightsaber action, family drama (soap opera in space?), etc. I must admit - I cried when Han met Leia again and my wife was amazed looking at my reaction! I would give it a 5 out of 5 stars. Perhaps the only disappointment I had was at the end when Rey met with Luke (is Luke going to reveal that he is her father in the next episode?) and he didn't utter a word! Anyway, great job JJ Abrams and team, and to be honest, I can't wait for the next installment (Episode VIII)!\n",
      "Disappointment Before I saw the movie, I'd already read some bad reviews. I'm a huge SW fan so I decided to go see it. I couldn't believe how poorly made this film was. Acting was mediocre to say the least with the exception of the droids and Chewbacca. The old cast trio acted very little in the film, especially Mark Hamil who appears only a couple of minutes. The light saber fighting scenes were poor and uninspired. I don't want to go into EU, non-canon issues as that's a personal opinion. For me it was a bad mistake not to follow the EU with all the epic material out there. I mean there is material right there, served on a golden platter. The villains were weak as it's usually the case with Disney's movies, all talk but no backbone. To have the main villain, the leader of the \"First Order\", be defeated by a girl who never touched a light saber before in her life... that spells disaster in my books. Where is the ominous presence of Darth Vader, Count Dooku, Darth Sidious, Obi Wan etc.? Where is the epic atmosphere of the previous films? What of this \"Supreme Leader Snoke\"? He looks like Gollum! Where on the galaxy did they find Luke's/Anakin's light saber and stored it in a chest in a basement?? That light saber was cut off Luke's hand and dropped in the chasm of Bespin's bottom (probably down in the ocean) in episode V. How did Kylo Ren find Darth Vader's mask? That was burned on the moon of Endor some 30 years ago. Finally the story. Ah the story, it seemed to me I was watching a remake of Episode IV... come on! Another bigger, badder Death \"Planet\"... No background, no nothing. I really do hope, George Lucas buys back the franchise, disavows this film, and makes a proper one. I give it a 2/10 grade, 1 for the SW logo and 1 for the past films. No more.\n",
      "Great film with some minor Flaws ** Spoiler Free**  This movie is great , people are complaining its a New hope remake and I was worried about it , but after seeing the film I can tell you with all honesty is a DAMN good film and a excellent star wars movie. -the good- X-wing vs tie fighter fights, Light-saber fights are emotional , Great humor , Great Villains -the bad- some characters needed more screen time , the score is not bad but for a john Williams score i was underwhelm , Some scenes are cut too fast (cant Appreciate all the creatures)  -the ugly- some CGI characters stood out too much because everything else are practical effects.\n",
      "A New Hidden Fortress Awakens feat. Voldemort and Professor Snape How come, when JJ Abrams and co. set out to continue the saga, they felt the best option was to simply remake A New Hope, which already was a re-imagining of Kurosawa's classic 'The Hidden Fortress'. Now we end up with three movies that are practically the same. What sets this movie apart from A New Hope is the inclusion of Voldemort, Professor Snape, a far more saturated image, steadicam and lens-flare overkill, a far more pronounced machine vs. nature theme (general Organa? wtf? Lets not make star wars into Avatar please) and an inverted \"I'm your father complex\" times two. I've been a long time fan of the original Starwars trilogy, like many others, and when I saw the first ratings of this movie I was stoked. It started out pretty good, but as the movie went along it became utterly frustrating because of the sheer laziness that went into constructing the plot. If you've never seen the original trilogy (which you should, obviously) and you're only familiar with the current trend of the over the top, candy-esque, box-office spectacles, you'd probably enjoy this movie. As for me, I'm not sure if I'm going to continue to follow the new saga. I'll probably stick with the original (despecialized) trilogy.\n",
      "awful star wars movie ever first of all new charters are very weak ,starting new bad boy :),girl and new boy is also looks like coming from cheap TV show series second, movie start very good first hour was good then suddenly you start to get bored and telling your self what is going on :) i really get very excited when i first hear new star wars movie coming and ,when i was watching the movie i pray the god to make me blind . i don't like the director when i first hear he will direct new star wars i said no , and bingo i was right please be honest your self and do not vote because it is just star wars new series what is the problem in Hollywood i don't know but nowadays we are watching just propaganda movies or expensive production but boring story based movies please if you gonna make our favourite movies worse please do not make it like terminator 3 etc please\n",
      "The Force put me asleep. I've never done this before but I can't stand it anymore so I had to write something about SWVII. So for those who care to read it this is my take on the last Star Wars. Warning spoilers are included for those who haven't seen it yet. The only good thing about this film to me is the female lead. She's good and she has the right tough temper. Overall I'm very disappointed because of the lack of imagination. This film is mostly a copy/paste of the 1977 episode IV. Remember the droid sent with something hidden in it and found by Luke ? It's really disappointing that with a universe like that writers in Hollywood can't come up with something new, original and creative. But anyway that's what Disney does all the time (copy/paste good film recipes), so that's what they wanted and that's what they did. We even have to stand the same old « I disable the shields so that you can destroy the death star » which we've seen three times now ! It's so boring. The only surprise is that the death star is bigger ! Wow shocking ! The other weaknesses in the film are : - The Bad guy looks strong at the beginning which is promising but then gets his ass easily kicked by a girl who's not even a Jedi yet ! - The phony and unoriginal « last Jedi location map » and one piece of the puzzle map missing. - The Han Solo'son and reverse father/son relationship is predictable cheap and doesn't work for me. - It's nice to put Harrison Ford back in but he's there too much sorry. And now to compensate that he can't have the same action scenes as before they have added humour. Some are good but it's way too much. Sometimes it made me feel like I was watching a Star Wars parody. Also because Han Solo is an important character it creates an unbalance in the story since the true heroes are Finn and Rey. The light saber is a holly thing to me and that's what they want to show when Rey touches it for the first time and the all idea of going to this island to bring it back to Luke. But then why does the old woman proposes Rey to take it since she doesn't even know her much or it appears so ? Why also is it so simply passing to the hands of Finn so he can have fun with it a little ? It's nice coming up with the idea that Finn is a storm trooper who wants to break free but how do you make us buy that ? Why does he so easily escapes ? Why all the others don't do like he does ? Why is he the only one that thinks « oh my god I'm killing innocent people I have to stop » ? The beginning of the film up to the moment when Han Solo is coming back was promising then the Force put me asleep",
      " If you want to see good truly imaginative, and gripping Star Wars films watch episodes IV, V, VI.\n",
      "The worst episode of all saga This is a very bad episodes for this saga. Inserting a funny afro American is a classic Hollywood stuff for a world wide pop up. Repeated story from the old episodes, really? For all this years they didn't design a original story. Don't know, but this is a big disappointment. Can't understand 8.5/10 for this comedy. Too much similar parts in the movie from the old episodes. OK, this is a movie for the kids right, but there is a too much aggregation for them. Don't know, but simple can't take this movie for a good, i hear too much laugh in the cinema hall for projection this movie like for a some Monty Python movie. Acting is good, but really John Boyega aka Finn is excess.\n",
      "Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Cringe List One fan's nit-picking is another's death by a thousand cuts.  1) Cool. Max von Sydow is in this, and he just said he needs to \"make things right.\" This should be an interesting back-story! Oh, wait. They just killed him. Into the Mystery Box with the interesting back-story, Mystery-Wrapped until season, er, EPISODE 8 at the earliest, when I think we'll also learn about the Hatch.  2) Stormtroopers have advanced beyond quaint sci-fi blaster tech to embrace",
      " flame throwers and Tasers. Finally.  3) Yay! It's the Millennium Falcon! Wait",
      " how'd it get on Tatooine 2? Relax: I'm sure it's NOT just a convenient coincidence. There has to be a plausible explanation coming.  4) Cool! Rey is a bad-ass pilot! Oh, but, how does a teenage junk collector become an ace spaceship flier? I bet there's a Beggar's Canyon 2 on Tatooine 2! Or womp rats! Either way, I'm sure an explanation is forthcoming.  5) Why is the Falcon in perfect working order after sitting unprotected on the surface of a blistering sand planet for umpteen years? Obviously, Han went for the Clear Coat option.  6) Wow, in addition to the Clear Coat, the Millennium Falcon must have been majorly reinforced in the past 30 years, because it's now slamming against the ground and not completely disintegrating like most other spaceships that have previously slammed against the ground in this particular galaxy.  7) Did Finn really look toward the camera and say \"Woo!\" like he just crushed it in Call of Duty?  8) Oh sh**. Still no mention of a Beggar's Canyon 2 or womp rats. Oh well, another file for the Mystery Box!  9) And still no reason given for the famous Millennium Falcon's convenient parking spot on the same planet where all three of our fresh-faced protagonists converge. Another one for the Mystery Box (subject line: \"For Smoke Monster Eyes Only\").  10) Yay! It's Han Solo and Chewie! Wait",
      " how did they manage to track the Millennium Falcon and then hyperspace jump directly to it 30 seconds after it took off from Tatooine 2? Faster- than-light-spaceship-tracking-and-travel has really come a long way in 30 years!  11) Finn didn't just ask if Rey has a \"boyfriend,\" did he? Ugh, he did. Maybe they will later \"hook up\" in a spacemaltshop?  12) For a soldier indoctrinated from childhood to be a ruthless cog in the First Order killing machine, Finn seems to be a remarkably well-adjusted and affable lad, quick with the good- times one-liners.  13) Why does that one gang of space pirates sound like the cast of Trainspotting? And why does that other gang of space pirates LOOK and sound like the cast of The Raid 2? Dammit, why am I thinking about these other movies in the middle of a Star Wars movie? I don't want to think about hardscrabble Glasgow and gritty Indonesian street fighting right now. 14) Those escaped tentacle monsters look like Kang and Kodos from the Simpsons Halloween specials. Only more cartoony.  15) Why did Kang and Kodos immediately kill and devour the Scottish gangsters and the Indonesian Kung Fu gangsters, but not Finn? It's probably because he's so damn well-adjusted and affable.  16) Wow, Rey is also a master mechanic who can fix the Millennium Falcon better than Han and Chewie. It's almost like she's a Mary Sue, or something. But JJ Abrams and Jake Kasdan's dad are not ladies, so by definition, that theory would make no sense at all, and I'm probably a sexist pig for even considering it.  17) Finn, a First Order conscientious objector, apparently has no objection to slaughtering his former First Order comrades. And quite affably, at that.  18) Kylo Ren is talking to Stimpy the big Gollum hologram (Gollugram?) now. Ouch: People in the audience are chuckling at Gollugram's hammy stage voice. Now I'm chuckling, too. Dammit, JJ! I didn't want to chuckle at this point in the movie.  19) Why is Gollugram so damn big? Oh no: This better not turn out to be an Oz thing. And why does this CGI look so shitty? Oh, right: An industry friend told me two weeks before this movie's release that, despite JJ's claim that the film was in the can, little visual effects elves were still furiously working overtime on it.  20) Christ, another Cantina scene? This time with Broadway space reggae. I f***ing can't believe they went with another Cantina scene. Wait, while I was obsessing over this offensive victory lap of another Cantina scene, I missed why they decided to bring BB-8, the galaxy's most-wanted droid, into the Cantina instead of hiding him on the g-d space ship.  21) Oh no. More rush-job CGI in the orange Yoda. Looks like the effects elves cranked the subsurface scattering up to 11, because Mazda Yoda looks all watery-swimmy. 22) OK, why is Rey hearing spooky children crying in the basement? Is this like Lord of the Rings now, where magic inanimate objects have a voice? I thought Obi Wan said that the Force binds all LIVING things. Why does a hunk of metal now channel Force powers? 23) Finn just looked toward the camera and lovingly gushed, \"That is a damn good pilot,\" as if he saw the cross-cuts of his his pal Poe in the cockpit along with the rest of us. And why did he look at the camera to say that? Does he want me to shout back, \"Yes, I agree!\"?  24) Oh for f***'s sake, I give up. (Storms out of theater.)\n",
      "Feel the Force once again... LOVED IT! There were many things I loved about this movie. As one who truly WAS THERE back in May of 1977 and who saw the first film 365 times in the theaters, Force Awakens was a trip back in time to reconnect with characters and a storyline from a galaxy long missed. Shot on FILM??? HELLO??? BREAKTHROUGH!! There's a vast difference in visual quality alone as well as those themes which weave through the storyline, you know when you're touching the spirit of those who were in previous films. No spoilers at all from this fan, I will simply say that I cannot wait until the digital version which I have already Pre-ordered surfaces so that I can watch it once again and reconnect with the vibe of the film. Many today for who this is their first exposure to Star Wars should watch the first trilogy, then the second, and then watch Force Awakens so the connect with the various homages to those films which exist in this one. Can't wait for the next Episode and I look forward to being able to see the final film of this new trilogy before I leave this lifetime. Enjoy the film and simply let yourself go into the world of that galaxy, far, far, away... and most of all...FEEL THE FORCE\n",
      "Star Wars is back! Very good movie. The prequels were so awful, this movie is such fun and a wonderful addition to the Star Wars family. The acting was excellent... such a change from the poorly acted prequels. The special effects were incredible and I loved the new robot. Just wish the movie didn't follow the original Star Wars movie so closely. But I'm sure the next movie will surprise us with wonderful new planets and lots of intriguing characters. It was so awesome seeing Han and Leia and Luke... and of course Chewbacca and the robots. i just hope the Death Star doesn't get used in any future movies... or if it is mentioned it's not the entire focus of the movie. But overall a fun movie to watch and I can't wait for the next movie.\n",
      "Guess the episode This is my first ever review on any movie on IMDb. So this means it's serious. So without spoiling it much here it goes: Just came home from the cinema, waited for this movie for so long and finally I can say that I've watched it. I should be ecstatic, overwhelmed, feeling like a little kid again, full of wonder and excitement and ready to boldly go where no man has gone before",
      " Instead I feel scammed. Without spoiling much of the movie – I know, it's practically impossible to spoil it now, a week after its global release – I will try to explain why this was NOT the Star Wars I was expecting to see. As soon I left the theater a friend of mine asked me how it was. I replied with a 6/10. This was a conservative estimated score. The more I think about this movie, the lower it goes. Before you jump on my throat with a light saber, let me justify this. We were waiting for this movie for so long. The hype train behind it reached Trans-Siberian levels of anticipation. We demanded a damn good Star Wars movie, after the horrendous last three, we needed this one to be as good – at least! – as the original ones. Having taken this into consideration, we also expected this one to surpass the original trilogy. The year is 2015 and visually there is almost nothing that cannot be done. Almost 40 years since we first saw a star destroyer firing laser beams at that small diplomatic vessel, I was primed for an equally epic panning first shot. That never happened. I can say that I was concerned from the get go, from the scrolling text that puts you in the story, but this would be a spoiler. I can only say that this exposition in yellow letters is the second worst since the one in episode III. Since this a spoiler-free review, I am forced to talk about this movie in general. Let's start. Visually the film is stunning. I watched it in HFR 3D and it was as sweet as your mama's a**. However, the 3D experience is – once again! – completely useless. Unless your name is Cameron, no director ever needs to promote a 3D version of his/her film!! So I suggest you go and see it in 2d, BUT – and this is important – go for the biggest screen possible. You will thank me later. And this is where it comes crumbling down. Besides the stunning visuals, true and seamless practical effects and colorful scenery, this is an empty film. The scriptwriter is from the original trilogy – Kasdan wrote episodes V and VI – so you would expect a stellar story. Something along the lines of TESB and not ROTJ, less fur, more substance. Surprises to be included also – mostly having to do with the family ties of the main characters. What we got was a rehash of the original one, albeit this is not 1977, we have seen this before and it's not going to blow our minds. Not anymore. We need something much stronger than that, something that is fresh, new, clever and above all F****ING ORIGINAL!!! Seriously Disney, you bought ILM only to make the same stories again and again??? No wonder some of the actors didn't want to play anymore in this new trilogy. This is not a NEW trilogy, it's the exact same story we've seen before – TWICE actually! – only with new actors. Even worse, they are given only a fraction of time to develop their character before they jump into an action scene, that makes no utter sense, precisely because we never got to be engaged with them. I never really gave a damn about Po, Fin, Rei or any other character in this film. F***, they even managed to ruin some of my favorite ones, like Chewie, C3-PO and Akbar!! This is the level of not-giving-a-turd-about-script that manages to destroy a franchise. Mercifully we were spared from another Jar-Jar (I feel dirty simply by typing that name) but this doesn't justify JJ's choice of making Chewie a walking carpet in this film – literally! The same old recipe doesn't work anymore in this brave new movie world. My only hope – a new hope! – is the last 2 minutes of this film. Suffice to say that for me, they make this whole shipwreck of a movie worth it (you might need to study some Jedi lore to actually grasp the meaning of these 2 minutes). I'll have to wait till episode VIII to see a truly epic Star Wars again. But then again, the middle episode V was – and still is – the best one. The force just hit the snooze button and is going to awake in the next episode. (For the original review please visit https://livingbesideme.wordpress.com/2015/12/26/star-wars-the-force- snoozes/)\n",
      "From the ashes of LucasFilms shall be woken, A light from the Disney shall spring; Awaken shall be Force that was forgotten; The Star Wars is back as it should be Watching Star Wars VII will definitely gives you the shivers! The movie manages to combine the new with old, paying a lot of respect to the legacy (New Hope) and prepares a new SW generation for the future. There's no ultimate bad and good guys here, there are gray zones and that's what makes the heroes so interesting. Yes sir, there are plot holes, but I guess most of them will be filled in the next episodes. As for now I am 100% emotionally satisfied, as J.J.Abrams delivered more drama that I was expecting. The music is the weakest installment of all, but still J.Williams delivered a magnificent space opera (go listen to 'Rey's Theme').\n",
      "Not for cynics Kind of sad to see the number of 1 stars out of 10 reviews.  Are you kidding me? I feel bad for anyone that bitter.  Out of every hundred movies made there are easily 90 that are worse.  It's a good lesson that history repeats itself with different twists.  Great effects.  Great action.  Good characters. Leaves you wondering next steps.  Saw the first when I was 7 in theaters.  I am going to chalk these negative reviews up to spoiled brat unemployed millenials with nothiñg better to do.  They are as a lot so entirely frustrated with their own personal failures that they can only derive happiness from tearing down others. Get a life.\n",
      "A little bit of a small disappointment I believe that I was a bit disappointed of this new follow up of Star Wars, not because it's that bad, compared to the latest (I, II, III), but because of the great response to the movie especially in here (imdb.com), which I'm using quite a lot, before choosing which movies to see in the cinema. Firstly, a lot of the scenes was taken directly from the old Star Wars movies (if you're Star Wars fans, you'll know which scenes that I'm thinking of). Secondly, the big bad villain who has been trained by a Jedi (the last skilled light sword and mind tricking master alive, that We know of), can't even win a light sword fight over a \"common\" Storm Trooper and a girl who haven't been trained at all. Lets remind ourselves, that he had killed all the other Jedi's that was trained by Luke Skywalker. Thirdly, Han Solo and Princess Leya, when he's ready for the travel to \"save\" their Son, it seems they are both getting ready for kissing each other, and suddenly he's hugging her in a very weird way instead. I must say this movie is worth watching from my point of view - BUT, I don't understand the score in IMDb. I know there's a lot of younger people giving points, but to see this movie reach as high in points as the old Star Wars movies (IV, V, VI), which were epic, for me screams out that something is wrong. As said before, this movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either - I know for sure, that if this Star Wars movie had been the first in a row of movies, I wouldn't have been as fascinated about Star Wars as I am, and I feel this movie is somehow taking advantage of the old movies. I hope the next movies in line will prove me wrong!\n",
      "Most overrated movie in history? What went wrong with this movie? Was it too much comedy? Or the countless plot holes and wtf moments I had while I was watching it? I really don't know. Were the first 10 minutes directed by the same guy, that did the rest of the movie? The movie had such a great introduction: dark, mysterious, violent. But it all went downhill from there... It's not only they took most of the story from Episode IV, there were so many scene that were just absurd and ludicrous. Han Solo popping out of nowhere, and the first thing he tells them is that \"all the old stories were right\". The whole scene felt awkward and forced (no pun intended) just to place it in the trailer. The first serious conversation Finn and Rey have is about her boyfriend... just horrible. Why does a stormtrooper soldier even ask this kind of question? I how did he turn from a trained killer to the Prince of Bel Air? When Kylo Ren took off his helmet I couldn't decide if this was Scary Movie 15 or Star Wars. He destroyed everything that made the Sith scary and fearful in 1 second.  There is one scene near the ending that is so incredibly bad it just makes you want to get up and leave the theater. It's a scene between Han Solo and Kylo Ren. This scene is a direct spit in the face to the bad-ass Han Solo we all know and love.\n",
      "The \"Farce\" awakens... *** May contain spoilers for who has not seen the movie or not been interested in Star Wars extended universe, books, games, etc. *** First of all I would like to congratulate J. J. Abrams for ruining the Star Wars Saga. This is a bad movie, a lousy script trying to duplicate the first Star Wars movie, episode IV, no depth, plot holes everywhere, and very bad acting. Adam Driver and John Boyega were both terrible. Boyega's character Finn was totally useless in every sense. Driver's Dark Jedi can only be called as a \"Sith-Com\", he reminded me of Rick Moranis' \"Lord Dark Helmet\" in Star Wars parody \"Spaceballs\". How can someone even think about about a lousy teenager Sith who destroys some panel in front of him when he gets angry about a failure and then returns calmly to say \"Anything else?\" Was that supposed to be funny? Can there be a Dark Jedi whose mastery about the force is so great that he can even paralyze his opponent in battle or stop a blaster rifle's energy shot in mid air for minutes, but cannot even win a light- saber duel with someone who has seen a light-saber for the first time in his life, that cannot even understand that it is a weapon? I am grateful that Darth Vader is dead and didn't see these happening. There were countless logical errors during the movie, especially in both opening and near the end, the bleeding injuries after being shot by blasters. Does Abrams think that blaster rifles shoot bullets? Hasn't anyone who has some logic didn't notice these kind of lousy errors? Only Daisy Ridley's acting was decent enough, but transforming her into a \"Satele Shan\" from Star Wars The Old Republic game trailers out of the blue and without any reason, with no training is non- sense. (And if we are to learn that she is Luke and Mara Jade's daughter in the next movie, it should have been mentioned in this one.) Almost every scene was predictable, especially the scene between the main villain and his father, which was a terrible scene, just put there to include a shocking tragedy, but unsuccessful. The final scene was supposed to be culminating, oh yes, the little girl finding her way to reach the long lost hero and reminds him of his duty by pointing out his ancestral weapon. At least duplicating Luke's search for Yoda in the Empire Strikes Back would be even better. In general, more than a film, this is some action filled scenes pasted one after other. And unfortunately just the presence of light-sabers or Millennium Falcon is not enough to call it a part of the Star Wars saga. The visual effects were good, but I personally think that the real success of the original trilogy was its minimalist atmosphere. J. J. Abrams shouldn't even be considered as a director, he clearly proves that he has no sense for cinema and knows nothing about \"telling\" a story. And it makes me think that the only thing he has seen about Star Wars may be Star Wars Rebels - The Animated Series. The level of seriousness is more or less alike.  The only good part is seeing Harrison Ford as Han Solo after all these years, but the way he was thrown into the story was truly amateurish, desperate to show him, but not knowing how to do. OK, you are trying to make a movie for kids but are your writers also elementary school kids? I rate 4 only because of Star Wars' sake.\n",
      "Review: Star Wars – The Force Awakens (2015) WARNING: POST CONTAINS SPOILERS After nearly a decade, the Star Wars franchise blasts back on to the big screen in J.J. Abrams' long-awaited episode seven. The film is set some thirty years after the death of the Emperor and follows the search for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who has gone into self-imposed exile after the failure of his attempt to resurrect the Jedi Order at the hands of his apprentice, now named Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who was seduced to the Dark Side of the Force by Snoke (Andy Serkis), the Supreme Leader of the First Order that arose in the aftermath of the galactic civil war and is attempting to restore the Galactic Empire. With the Senate of the New Republic refusing to acknowledge the threat of the First Order, Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) has gone back underground and is the General in command of the resistance within the First Order's territory and is supported in a deniable fashion by some elements of the New Republic. To some viewers dismay, the original trilogy cast are secondary to the plot and this is very much a 'passing of the torch' film, with the new characters taking centre stage as it focuses on Rey (Daisy Ridley), a scavenger on the planet Jakku, and Finn (John Boyega), a defecting Stormtrooper, who meet on Jakku after Finn helps resistance fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) escape from the Star Destroyer he was being held prisoner on, and how they all are swept up in the search for the last Jedi. As with all Star Wars films, the effects are stunning and the action fast passed and thrilling, but my prejudices against Abrams' story telling abilities remain very much intact as the plot is a rehash of episode four with Lawrence Kasdan's writing efforts seemingly limited to ensuring the original trilogy characters remain true to form. Of the original trilogy characters, it is Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who drives a lot of the action forward as we learn that Kylo Ren is, in fact, his and Leia's estranged son, Ben Solo. Because the plot is a reworking of episode four, we could see very early on that Solo was the Obi-Wan figure and that he would meet his end at the hands of Kylo Ren in the same way that Obi-Wan died at the hands of Darth Vader. Even so, his death is a genuinely shocking moment as, even though we all saw it coming, it was still a surprise to see that the writers and studio had the nerve to kill off such a popular character. There are a lot of plot holes and gaps in the storyline such as how Han lost the Millennium Falcon, how the First Order came about and why they're not using clone Stormtroopers who are programmed for obedience, and who Snoke is and how he came to lead the First Order. I know that there is a trilogy of novels being written by Chuck Wendig to bridge the gap between episodes six and seven, but there's no guarantee that all of the fans will read them which means the pressure is now on episode eight to deliver a lot of this back story. Having said all of that, the writing is very well done with well-rounded and likable characters, good action set pieces and an excellent lead in to episode eight in 2017. One of my biggest gripes with the writing is that it was stressed that this would be a new storyline for the Star Wars universe and that it would not have anything to do with the story lines in the extended universe novels, and yet it certainly borrows from both the Heir to the Empire and Fate of the Jedi series so much so that I have to wonder why they didn't just film those books. Even with all of the above mentioned flaws I'd still recommend going to see it, but, for me, this was a six out of ten movie that just about escapes being a 'meh' moment.\n",
      "If you are a Star Wars fan, you will be very Disappointed People asked, \"how was the movie?\" Well, my wife slept through some of it,and I stepped out to use my cell phone.\" It was incredibly boring and mediocre: episodes 1-6 were much better than this. Episode 3 blew episode 7 away. It's as though Disney put forth the least amount production effort in the movie after acquiring the franchise and is counting on the cult status of the franchise to drive ticket sales; unfortunately it appears to be working. If you have read other reviews that state this is a regurgitation, or reboot, of a previous episode; they are not wrong. This movie lacks any new story line for us to enjoy, and the new characters are weak and underdeveloped. I didn't care if any of the \"good guys\" lived, or died. Again, very disappointing. We can't recommend this movie\n",
      "Hey! lets put up a bigger death star this time or a planet maybe This thread contains crucial spoilers please proceed with caution. I still cannot believe how senseless and low IQ people the dark side folks are. They have already lost 2 dark stars (twice the same way and the same star) and yet this time they have a huge death planet but still the weakest point of the weapon is on the surface and penetrable. What is the point. Well the Empire never learn from the past thats what it looks like. On the other hand Jedi training starts from Padavan class which the Jedi candidates are so young and juvenile pupils. How could it be possible for a fresh starter Jedi young woman to be a match for almost a master Sith lord. JJ Abrams let down again as he always does.\n",
      "Just Plain Fun!!! I gave this movie a 10. Loved it to be honest. Seen it 2 times already. The 2nd time you kind of pick up on things you may have missed the first time around. It is worth the watch if you ask me. If you have not seen the First 6 movies I would suggest you do to get a better understanding of the whole universe. I plan on seeing it again next year in January, then buying it when it is released!!! I thought there were also some pretty funny parts as well. Now I can't wait for the next episode to come out, I am sure it will be just as good!!!! So for the New Year take your whole family out for a treat and watch Star Wars together!!! Happy New Year!!!\n",
      "People Need To Lighten Up. It Wasn't Great, but it was Fun. I am old enough to have seen every Star Wars film in their original runs and have been a fan of the franchise from the beginning. Seems like everyone wants to be a professional movie critic these days. I read reviews where people just want to complain at a level that tells more about how unhappy they are rather than taking a movie for what it it. Then you have the movie studio shills writing ridiculously positive reviews that makes this film comparable to Citizen Cane. Finally you have the hard-core fans that will not complain about this film under any condition. My message is simple...Lighten Up. I took my 9 year old to see his first major Star Wars film in a theater for the first time that he will remember and spend as much time observing the movie from a child's perspective rather than a cynical adults that spends as much time looking for the flaws than enjoying the ride. My son cheered when the good guys prevailed, cried when Han Solo died and has spent the last several days speaking of the film.  As Yoda said: \"Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.\"  Now from the cynical adults perspective: It wasn't perfect. This was certainly a \"Passing of the torch\" movie where you have to deal with the aging original cast while incorporating the new cast of characters. I knew this was going to be troublesome giving ample screen time to everyone. To be honest, the way Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford have aged, they can no longer carry a Star Wars and sell the sizzle like they used to. Father time has caught them. I didn't have much of a problem re-treading some of the original concepts, but the film certainly went too far. The new Death Star plot was weak. The film did not need another \"Ultimate Weapon\". The Villains were not particularly meaning. I would call them almost comical. You will have a hard time finding a kind word about Kylo Ren. My biggest disappointment was they made this weenie to be the offspring of Han Solo/Leia and of course the grandson of Anakin Skywalker. I would have preferred this character to have been a non-related Jedi recruit that went rogue rather than a descendant of Skywalker. Although the new 3 main actors were obviously cast by race, sex and national origin I must say I liked them and they had really good chemistry.  I am going to take the perspective that after ROTJ, the Sith and the Jedi were pretty much wiped out and were are not catching them at their prime. I am hoping the next film cleans up some of the plot shortcomings. For now, enjoy the ride.\n",
      "At least they did not \"rape\" Harrison Ford this time. All the way back home from IMAX I was wondering why this particular one seemed to be for me the only not-so-awesome episode from all the Star Wars\" films. Every other one I simply love and hold dear like a part of my childish memories, but this one did not have even a small part of epicness we could see in the previous movies. No scene will be remembered as a classic, no actor will become a new generation movie hero - neither a villain",
      " The old faces from the original saga make this film good and it's not only a sentiment – they are now much better as actors (Mark Hamill's look at the end of the film is",
      " you just need to see that!). Unfortunately the young ones have much to learn and I am not only talking about the Jedi skills. My final rating is 7/10 and I sadly need to say I am simply disappointed as a Star Wars\" fan. The character Rey, although as a mix of Keira Knightley and Natalie Portman, she's only a kid and it's hard to identify with the kids on the plan as they are very average in every aspect. On the other hand, Rey started better than young Anakin, so she still can show something better in next two episodes and I hope she will. Finn as a character was given a role of another Afro-American that needs to make a lot of wows\" and he's overacting like the pilot in The Matrix: Reloaded\", so I just confirmed my concerns I had after watching the trailers. Kylo Ren is not even a shadow of Darth Vader",
      " The soundtrack is nice, special effects are amazing (worth watching in 3D – especially for X-Wings, Ties and a Star Destroyer). I think J.J. Ambrams did more good with Star Trek\" to give it a new life. I expected much more than improving a visual aspect. Maybe it's a Disney thing",
      " At least my wife loved it... And",
      " they didn't rape Harrison Ford this time! I suppose we should be grateful for this detail.\n",
      "nostalgic feeling I must have watch the star wars movies few hundred times. JJ stayed in a safe zone in the story line. it seems like copy cut paste of the episode 4 - 5 - 6 ı was hoping some original scenes and new vision to the franchise. What he did in star trek was great. but for star wars its to weak. Villain Kylo Ren needed more depth to it.. my opinion Disney is trying to reach out to new generation and create a new fan base.  Kylo Ren needed some serious dark side in him. I wish they got help from C.Nolan for that character. he would have made him a bad ass Jr.Sith lord. What C.Nolan dd with Joker character was amazing in Batman franchise. ıt really gave me a nostalgic feeling our expectations are high for this Saga. ı have to say Fin is great Daisy Ridley is a great choice for the role. for Kylo they needed somebody else casting department for kylo failed.\n",
      "Typical bland joyride - no depth I found myself really trying to like this movie...it was hard. Was it all bad? No, of course not. Most any bad movie has its virtues.  I don't even know if I'd call it bad, just...not good. *spoilers* Both of the new main characters basically had no past worth mentioning. Finn had the upbringing of an automaton, and Rey was stuck on a desert planet to scavenge by herself, with apparently no friends. Finn wants to leave. Rey doesn't. That's honest to God the only difference between the two characters as far as actual character is concerned - level of courage - which gets switched around as the movie progresses, making the two completely interchangeable.  Reactions to events in the movie are dry and unfeeling. *HUGE SPOILER* Let's not lose sight of the gravity of what the first order did in this movie. They are most likely authorities on the strength of their enemies. And according to them - They JUST BLEW UP THE REPUBLIC. THE CORE OF THE REPUBLIC, PROBABLY CORUSCANT ITSELF!!! Take the population of Alderaan and multiply it by at least 50 for that planet alone!!! And there were at least 5 planets destroyed! Was anyone affected? Did anyone react, beyond \"They've just wiped out a whole solar system!\" Almost saying \"That bratty kid, look what he just did to those planets!\" Hello!!! We're talking PROBABLY 50 TRILLION PEOPLE. You know how in Abrams's Star Trek, Vulcan gets destroyed, and the whole rest of the movie has the pain of Spock and the goal of justice for the Vulcans as the driving force of the movie? Right? You know how force sensitives could sense Alderaan's destruction? There was NOTHING. There are multiple other examples - these are just the big criticisms that underlay the fatal flaws of this movie as I see them. The characters are bland, the relationships don't feel real, and nobody cared about what they were doing. I couldn't feel anything in this movie. I wanted to like it, badly. I wanted Star Wars to be given new life, but I left this one numbed by the gaping vacuum I had just experienced. JJ. You can do better than this, don't be afraid of the new franchise. Don't be afraid to take risks, to crate a new equal chapter of this cultural icon. Don't hesitate to make us feel something, for fear of tampering with what we've all hailed as theatrical perfection.  Your other movies prove you've done this same formula, and far better than this. What happened???\n",
      "I can feel the hate swelling in you now! A review for the fans. The film is a masterpiece of escapism entertainment and so what if the template was borrowed in part from previous Star Wars movies (especially the original trilogy) – those movies worked! I'm not surprised at all with some of the hate filled reviews on here, I guess you can't please all of the people all of the time – only the vast majority of the developed world who can afford a ticket. Admittedly nostalgia levels were very high, but I felt as though they were warranted when I watched the finish article, as all boxes were ticked. *Potential very small spoiler* I particularly enjoyed the quite literal 'Force Awakening' scenes with the main force sensitive characters (not yet Jedi or Sith), who in some cases were literally fighting for their lives with zero training and a yet unknown midichlorian count. I'm looking forward to being able to share the experience with my 6 year old son one day soon, I'm sure he won't be dissecting the plot, drawing parallels with the originals and complaining about a \"lack of vision\". The torch as finally been passed to a new generation, well done JJ and company!\n",
      "A-Mazing!!! Being a massive Star Wars fan, I went along to the midnight launch in 3D (UK) and I was completely blown away from start to finish! I didn't get to sleep until 4am and I was due in work later that morning... I've been back to see it again, it was that good! But I have to say this movie had all of the ingredients you need for a major blockbuster and I salute you Mr Abrams for putting together a stunning masterpiece for all of us fans. Not only has it re- energized the Star Wars universe/franchise but it has introduced us to some exciting new characters in Rey, Finn, Kylo Ren and BB-8 - to name a few as well as reuniting us with the faces from the past! Can I just mention that Daisy Ridley is truly fantastic in her role as Rey, she has made me fall in love with her character and I now have a new Star Wars character fave! Each to their own and everyone has an opinion but if you're a true Star Wars fan then you will absolutely love this movie as it makes you feel nostalgia and takes you back to original trilogy as well as welcoming you to a whole new chapter in the galaxy far far away.  I will watch this movie, like the originals over and over again. Thank you to all involved for making this film an absolute classic! Canny wait for Episode 8 now!\n",
      "SWIIV an awesome flick I read all the shitty reviews on IMDb of the new Star War movies from 'so called' critics and I laughed out loud at their reasons why they hated the movie. But these reviewers are just amateurs who try to bash a great movie. The professional reviewers wrote - USA Today 4 out of 4 stars, the Guardian 5 out of 5 Stars, The SF Chronicle 5 out of 5 stars and called it a great movie that was both thrilling and humorous, The Wall Street Journal headline 5 out of 5 stars - \"The Star Wars you have been waiting for\". If the movie is as bad as the amateur critics on IMDb states, why does it have an 8.5 IMDb rating? Why is this movie going to gross over $3 billion dollars if word of mouth regarding the flick mirrored the crappy reviews found on IMDb? These reviewers who tell you that Star Wars VII it is a bad flick are just bitter people who live in the basement of their Moms' home and probably think Scy-Fi's Expanse show is awesome (it's not). I have seen the movie Star Wars twice including IMAX and love it. The movie is 150 minutes long but feels 90 minutes. It's a great flick – the two best movies this year are Mad Max and Star Wars VII.\n",
      "J.J. brought a balanced, not forced, return to the Star Wars saga I will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but if you still haven't seen it: stop reading about it, and go see it. In The Force Awakens, as with other reboots and sequels of old franchises, it's a challenge to balance the old with the new. The two previous trilogies were both of their time, and different in many ways. This new one will also need to be of its time, and different from the other ones. Story wise, it's obviously more connected to the original trilogy. In addition to this, the structure of the movie itself is very much based on the older trilogy. Much of the movie acts like a parallel to episode IV, while at the same time feeling different enough to not be considered a remake or rehash of the same ideas. As in other sequels, the original cast - now old and weary - is back in this one. Without going into spoilers, I will say that they all did a superb job acting wise, and I liked the way their stories has progressed. What's more interesting, though, is that is the new characters you end up feeling most excited about. It's great to see the old cast, and they are very much involved in the plot, with important parts in regards to action and plot. But still, it's the new characters you come out of the cinema thinking about, and look forward to seeing again. Especially Kylo Ren was interesting. I like how they portrayed the conflict between the light and dark side of the force, it's much more believable than it feels in the other movies (especailly the prequel trilogy). The movie is much more busy than the previous films. I think that's natural in today's cinema environment, and that it works well. Watching it, the story just kept on giving, and there was great, fantastic scenes throughout. I wasn't bored for a second. I can see this disappointing some fans - but as mentioned before, I think that Star Wars movies should be of their time. The special effects were fantastic as well. The practical effects, like costumes and so, worked brilliantly in conjunction with the newer stuff. The few CGI/Mo-cap-characters that had big roles were maybe the weakest point SFX-wise, but they were by no means eyesores. The movie ends in a way that to me was satisfying. It's obviously the first part of a longer story, and there's many more questions to be answered. Some less significant questions I assume will not be answered in the big movies, but rather TV-shows or other media. The big questions will obviously come back in the later movies. Especially regarding the back story of certain new characters, and the whole situation in the galaxy. (On that note: I liked the opening crawl. Informative and to the point. Neiter the crawl nor the rest of the movie is too heavily focused on \"what happened in-between\" VI and VII.) A last note: I've seen people complain (and worry) about too much fan service. As a fan, I am mostly very happy with the choices they made. Take this review with a pinch of salt. I was very much a part of the hype leading up to this movie, and I might have other thoughts after a re-watch or two.\n",
      "On The Force Awakens If I was to write a review on Star Wars: The Force Awakens on IMDb, this is what I would say: that the fans are divided into three psychological categories, when it comes to the latest film: 1) The ones that are so into it, that feel grateful even for the prequels, even though they're smart enough to see that Jar-Jar is more destructive to the soul than a Star Destroyer... and they are positive, optimistic, and rather prefer to indulge into the sweet disposition of simply watching Star Wars for the great movie it is. (Like the fans of Federer.. they know he's the king, and still adore him even if he sometimes loses xD) 2) The unsatisfied ones, because they truly honor Star Wars so much for what it should be, that they feel they have the right to criticize everything they find inconvenient... like saying that this Star Wars has no original story and so on... (But I personally disagree with them, they forget this is just the beginning of a new story, thirty years after the Originals, and The Force Awakens is a foundation to the sequel trilogy... for them, I only have this advice, give it a chance and wait to see how the story unfolds in the next Episodes. ) 3) Amateurs... that criticize it by a need to be up to date with the newest films en vogue, that never really cared about Star Wars and don't value the impact it had in the science-fiction world.\n",
      "Tears of joy, wonderful experience! Warning! This review contains spoilers!!! (I am still almost speechless, so here a some thoughts about this movie / excuse my bad English) Wow, what can i say. The long wait was finally over and i got to see Episode VII. It is a masterpiece. This is what the franchise needed. It is a perfect new start that reminds us of A New Hope but contains new elements such as Kylo Ren, the bad guy who is trapped between the dark and light side of the force and some interesting family constellations. YES it is true, there is a lot of fan-service, but seriously, that is what we all wanted to see! The balance of humour and serious parts is wonderfully constructed and the sets are mindblowing and just beautiful. The movie contains several parts where i, being a true fan of Star Wars for years, just couldn't hold back my tears. When the resistance arrives with their X-Wings on Takodana, when Han Solo enters the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon etc. All those moments are pure gold and everything iwas hoping for. The ending with Luke had me cry like a baby. One of themost epic things i have seen. YES, i would consider myself a fanboy toa certain degree, but i am able to reflect and overthink what i saw. Don't listen to the ones who bash this movie, because they are not satisfied with their own lives and always find something to hate on. As a true fan, you will love this movie. For me, i just can't wait to see it a second time. Life is good.\n",
      "A really great film, watch it !!!!! First off, I watched this film after watching all 6 of the previous films (guess I'm not the first) and avoided reviews of this one (again, not the first). I absolutely, wholeheartedly loved this film, it's fantastic, I want to see it again, NOW! Let's get down to the nitty gritty. Visually, wonderful, harks back to the first film (in 1977) and integrates todays CGI without making you feel as if you're watching a cartoon. The live action sequences are totally edge of the seat stuff, the change of scale stuff (seeing Rey mucking about inside a Star Destroyer, then panning out to see the thing crashed in the sand are truly awesome, no doubt. The characters are as well drawn out as they can be, it's a sci-fi-opera genre, don't forget. The new characters, Rey &amp; Finn, well, you just root for them, don't you? Chewie &amp; Han, you love them already. Princess Leia adds a new depth, although you feel you want to know more about what's gone on there. Our new baddies are 1: anguish, but acted much, much better than Haydn Christianson, 2:Wow, evil beyond contempt The story, music, acting, visuals kept me very much entertained &amp; wanting for more. Guys and Gals, it's about time we faced up to it, this is a great film, one of the most successful in all time, it's especially good for the 40+s like me who saw the first films for the first time out. J.J.Adams has done a fantastic job, hands down, Kudos. I think what's going on here is, the older people (like myself, of the generation that saw the first films the first time in the 70's / 80's) saw what we always wanted, loved it, consumed it, oh! But the younger generation, bless, can't relate to it quite so much. My opinion is, it's a wonderful film, well worth watching &amp; well worth watching again &amp; again to see the nuances I missed. I enjoy, now, being able to talk to friends about it &amp; revel in it. Summary, wonderful, enjoyed every minute. Bad points: Rubbish reviews. Grow up, people, if you can do better, go do it! This is a really good movie, well worth seeing, entertaining, you know what you're going to get &amp; you actually get much, much more... For me, 7 euros is the best money I have spent in years. Not so bad, eh?\n",
      "Abrams nails it the force is strong with this one I'm not ashamed to admit it I'm a massive fan and have been all my life. I was disappointed with the prequels so when I heard this was being made I was feeling a little hopeful. This is essentially a case of the events in the originals have been forgotten and the Galactic Empire has been replaced by the First Order (same evil intentions). Luke Skywalker etc are all myth and legends and are largely forgotten about. Enter Kylo Ren a former Knight of the Order of Ren (think Sith Lord) and and his stormtroopers who are trying to hunt down a certain Last of the Jedi Knight called Luke Skywalker who has apparently been in hiding for years and just vanished. Throw into the mixer the original heroes such as Leia, Han Chewbacca with C3PO and R2D2, along with some new blood in Rey (a scavenger who is force sensitive and not too bad with a lighsabre) Finn (a stormtrooper who runs as he won't kill for the First Order) and Po who is the best pilot in the resistance. I'm missing a lot out here but it is deliberate as there is too much for me to go in depth about.\n",
      "The Force Is Strong With This One As a die-hard Star Wars fan, I felt this movie breath and live a new version of Star Wars. It was NOT like the prequels, but then again, it was NOT like the original trilogy- it was a beautiful conflation of everything we've seen of Star Wars (with a bit of modern humor). This start to a wannabe epic trilogy is well on its way to become emotionally tearing, excitingly intense, and elegantly original. Not only does Star Wars: The Force Awakens bring a homecoming to the eager fans who grew up with the original trilogy, it applies to the fans of the prequel trilogy, and also to a new generation of Star Wars fans- this movie applies to everyone who has a lust for great movie-making and classic storytelling innovation. The people who made this new installment have a love for Star Wars as do many, many fans. If you think about it, it is only the fans that made this movie. Regardless of who funds the movie (Disney), they did an amazing job of appealing to all ages.  I encourage all TRUE Star Wars fans to discard all the negative reviews and develop your own opinion. The rants of \"it's just \"A New Hope\" again or \"What a weak plot line\" are irrelevant in context with what actual happens in the movie. In all honesty, nothing actually happens in it where I immediately jump to any conclusion.\n",
      "The franchise is rescued. Episode 7 has redeemed a franchise that for many hardcore traditional fans had become a niggling source of disappointment. This is everything that 1, 2 &amp; 3 weren't. The acting is solid - something we've never really associated with the franchise. The music is not clichéd - there are some new themes which will most likely catch on. The storyline is coherent and promises longevity and the action is gripping.  From the opening scene you realize that 32 years after Return of the Jedi and the utter disappointment of 1, 2 &amp; 3, Star Wars fans are finally in for a treat. It is a return to what worked, The directing is solid as is the dialogue, in fact probably the best dialogue in all seven films.\n",
      "Star Wars: The Force Awakens – A Winning Combination of \"A New Hope\" and a \"Newer Hope\" The plot of \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" (hereafter \"SW:TFA\") is as follows – a group of freedom fighters must escort a beeping 'droid containing information which may be a critical key in defeating an enemy bent on universal conquest. Golly gee, this sounds an awful lot like \"Star Wars IV: A New Hope\", doesn't it? Some \"SW:TFA\" viewers have grumbled about director J.J. Abrams pulling this \"moth-eaten\" plot out of the closet. I think it's a stroke of nostalgic craftiness. Perhaps Abrams sensed that after the arguably grim, depressing, and disheartening trilogy about the descent of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vaderism, moviegoers needed a bit of reminding about why we still cherish the \"Star Wars\" saga/myth. As has been said countless times before, it's not really about the light saber play, spaceship dogfights, or dazzling universal vistas that make this space opera timeless – it's the flawed, complicated, empathetic characters (whether human, 'droid, or alien) who strive to be heroic and/or struggle with corrupt impulses. With this reminder, Abrams (a life-long \"Star Wars\" fan) and \"SW:TFA\" reawaken \"Star Wars\"'s greatness. Abrams borrows the \"A New Hope\" plot, but does not slavishly copy it. He adds his own distinctive touches to move the old \"A New Hope\" plot into a \"Newer Hope\" plot. First, he immediately jumps into action by showing former Empire (now known as the First Order) Stormtroopers attacking a Rebel Alliance (now known as the Resistance) outpost on the desert Tatooine-like planet Jakku. The Stormtroopers are seeking the new 'droid\" unit containing the secret information: BB-8, who looks like a beach ball with a salad bowl for a head. Ace Resistance pilot, the Hans-Solo like Poe Dameron (\"Do you talk first, or do I talk first?\") inserted the information disk into BB-8. Poe urges the spherical droid to flee into the desert wasteland and somehow locate former Princess (now Resistance General) Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). But then, another radically new development (and character) appears. One of the Stormtroopers is suddenly reluctant to continue massacring the Resistance outpost. He doesn't even have a proper name, until Poe finds him and christens him Finn (John Boyega). Poe and Finn attempt to escape in an X-Wing fighter but a New Order pilot shoots them down. They crashland back on Jakku and Poe disappears into some kind of vortex. The confused, battle-weary Finn stumbles around Jakku until he finds BB-8 with \"SW:FKA\"'s third original character, Rey (Daisy Ridley). Like a Jawa, the orphaned, solitary, self-reliant Rey scavenges Jakku for scrap metal to trade for food. She is on the verge of trading in BB-8, but senses the 'droid is much too valuable. Rey, BB-8, and Finn form a hasty trio and run desperately for transport to get away from the First Order forces. They have to settle for the bucket of bolts that happens to be the Millennium Falcon (remember her?). They manage to escape, largely because of Rey's uncanny command of mechanics and technological devices. Before long, they run into the Falcon's original owner, our favorite intergalactic wiseguy, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his hirsute co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Mostly, Han is still the devil-may-care, humorously irreverent smuggler still being chased by vengeful customers, as he is in \"SW:TFA\". And yet, the grizzled veteran has mellowed somewhat; he now believes in the Force more and agrees to help Rey and Finn with their mission. After deciphering BB-8's data as a portion of a map, Han and company all escape to the Endor-like forest planet Takodana to seek a wizened, wise cantina owner Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) who can connect them to the Resistance. The First Order, nominally led by the merciless General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) but ultimately controlled by the towering Emperor-like Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), track them there and attack. General Leia and her Resistance forces also arrive and counterattack. Maz reveals that Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill's) light saber is hidden in the cantina and entrusts Finn with it. However, Finn wants no further part of the Resistance/First Order war and seeks asylum with other aliens. Meanwhile, Rey shows signs that she would be a more appropriate recipient of the light saber. She shows strange abilities and powers far beyond fixing things. Nevertheless, the First Order captures and imprisons her. The First Order's chief warrior, a fallen, iron-masked, Jedi Knight with anger-management issues named Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) attempts to seduce Rey to The Dark Side on a new, gargantuan Death Star about 100 times the original's size. Han, Chewie, and a re-converted Finn mount a rescue. Do they succeed? Is Rey truly Jedi material? Who is she anyway, and, for that matter, who is Finn? Who are Kylo's parents? Where is the rest of the map and what does it show? Do C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) show up? Did Poe survive the vortex? Just where the hell is Luke, assuming he's still alive? Why is he missing? \"SW:TFA\" answers some of these myriad questions and mysteries and leaves others tantalizingly up in the air, for future sequels. \"SW:TFA\" is, in my opinion, a thorough triumph. It's hyperspeed-paced yet clear and comprehensible. All the characters are serious yet funny and not trapped in self-importance. In fact, the otherwise bold, appealing, and resourceful Rey and Finn are somewhat reluctant heroes, but still game for the danger the First Order represents. Unforeseen, genuinely shocking and emotional confrontations occur. Most importantly, \"SW:TFA\" takes the old, seemingly rusty and time-worn elements that distinguish \"Star Wars\" and makes them new, fresh, exciting, and more relevant than ever. The eighth sequel can't arrive fast enough. The Force is indeed awake and a \"Newer Hope\" (embodied by Rey, Finn, and BB) for the Resistance is born.\n",
      "Awesome OK, I must say, actually as some have said, that's not that perfect movie, but come on, say that this is the worst sequence or a a remake... A droid carrying classified rebel information, a villain wearing a mask and with a synthesized voice, a powerful machine even bigger than the Death Star that can destroy planets, light sabers fights, aren't these the essence of Star Wars!? In my opinion it just sounds perfect, J.J. Abrams just tries to keep the essence of Star Wars and also tries to show what Star Wars is for a new generation of fans. He gathered the most important elements from the other six episodes and inserted in this one, and now everybody has enough new elements to workout in the next sequences like linking the space between Episode VI throughout VII etc. I really miss some more breathtaking scenes, so that's why, in my opinion, it doesn't deserve a 10 grade, but I really liked it. There's a lot fun that we don't see in the other episodes and the script itself is not that bad... I must say I read some topics before watching the movie and I was really afraid in being disappointed with the movie, but fortunately it didn't happen. I'll for sure will watch it again and again and again... It really worth the ticket and expectations!  May the Force be with you all!\n",
      "Fast Paced It was a great movie. It was very similar to The Original Trilogy. One negative I have is that some plot points were very similar to A New Hope. Leia and Han are great in the movie as are the newcomers. There are many unanswered questions that hopefully the next movies will touch on. I hope for the rest of the trilogy they try and make it their own, and not completely like the OT. I can't wait to see where they take this story and I do hope that the future directors will take the reins more and make their own vision as well, instead of playing it safe. Overall, There is never a dull moment and there is so much action and drama. You will remain processing what happened for quite a while.\n",
      "Best of the series so far! Star Wars, The Force Awakens is by far the best of the series. Not to take anything away from the original trilogy and the prequel, but I eager to see what they do with the last two in this true sequel. The story, special effects and acting was simply amazing! Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher did a wonderful job reprising your original roles. The new actors and actresses also did a fine job with their respective roles, helping to add depth and originality to this movie. I also enjoyed the insertion of Easter Eggs throughout the movie, such as the remains of damaged and destroyed ships and weapons from the former movies. If you are able, check this out in IMAX 3D! Star Trek, move over, Star Wars is back!\n",
      "A true squeal to the Star Wars trilogy I felt like a little kid in the movie theater seeing it opening night. I don't want to spoil anything so this review will be brief. The movie is very familiar to fans of the original trilogy. It captures the magic that was Star Wars in the late 70s early 80s. The new actors mix with the old is great, almost feels like passing the torch. You actually care for the characters and care for what happened to them. It's also the funniest Star Wars movie there's been. Even my wife liked the movie and she doesn't like Star Wars. She thought BB8 was really cute and I'm glad she went with me. I highly recommend everyone give it a shot because it's actually a great movie.\n",
      "Objectively the best movie in the franchise I was 11 when Star Wars came out in 1977, and I fell in love with that movie. To me, it was one of the most entertaining pieces of movie making ever made, and it still is. But this was better. Hard to admit, but this really was better. Why? It's hard to write a truly complete review without spoilers, but there are none below. Here are the reasons this is a truly great movie. 1) It tells a story on its own. Whether or not you ever saw or ever will see any of the first 6 movies, this movie can stand on its own. Lawrence Kasdan (Return of the Jedi), J.J. Abrams, Michael Arndt, (and George Lucas received a writing credit too although I believe just for the creation of the characters) did a masterful job of packaging a story of good vs. evil that anyone can relate to. This is evidenced by the ratings on IMDb which are pretty steady across age groups and male/female split. This movie actually does a little better with the under 18 crowd vs. people like me who were around for the first, and that surprised me. So kudos for an arguably great story. 2) It ties back to the prior movies. The plot lines which tie back to the prior stories tie back well. They are feasible, but not overdone. As a viewer who has seen all of the movies, you understand how the universe moved on from Episode VI to where it stands in Episode VII and you can believe it wholeheartedly. As a person who has never seen Star Wars, you would get enough back story to understand the state of the universe in this movie. It gives you enough character history that you understand where the old characters came from, why they think like they do, and how they influence the new characters. Again, though, it's not overdone. I think Abrams hit it just right. For new viewers, its probably enough to make them want to find out where the old characters came from, but it's not required to understand this movie. I see movie download demand for past Star Wars movies spiking a lot after people watch this. (This section of the review would be much more clear and succinct if I could just use a few spoilers!) 3) The score. John Williams nails it. Enough said. 4) Writing. The lines and dialog in this movie are sharper than in past movies. I've never been a huge fan of campy dialog in my movies, particularly when characters lives are in danger. I didn't notice any awkward, campy lines in this movie. With that said, the old characters retain their personalities from the past and the new ones create their own. Lastly, the writing was age appropriate to the characters. You didn't see older Leia, Han, or Luke in hand to hand 1:1 combat holding their own against a 25 year old new character. How they got things done was appropriate to their age. Just excellent writing. 5) Acting. If I \"see\" the actor instead of the character, then I know the acting was bad. That never happened with this movie. About 5 minutes in, the actors were the characters. I never caught myself wondering about what John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, or Adam Driver had done in the past because I wasn't seeing them. I was only seeing Finn, Rey, and Kylo Ren. The older characters brought back their same personalities from the past, but aged appropriately, so they did a great job too. 6) Special Effects. Newer technology obviously works in the movie's favor. Industrial Light and Magic is again the special effects team as it has been for all the movies, and their magic is evident in many places. However, I think the real credit goes to Abrams' vision. Take the dogfight scenes as an example. They are shot and shown from many points of view and are frantic in nature. Just like they would be in real life. The bad guys don't stop shooting just so a character can get in a one liner. Where Abrams had to use special effects to build a scene, he did so well and in some ways, like the acting, the effects just disappeared so you were in the scene, not marveling at the effects. It also seems like he made a lot less use of CGI in places where it wasn't needed. If you go back to Episode 5, there's a scene of Anakin riding the back of an animal in a field with Padme. The CGI of the animal and his ride are almost painful to watch. There's a scene in this movie early on with a character riding an animal. My guess is that it's real, but if it's CGI, it melts away beautifully and you never see it. Going back to the premise of the summary line, objectively it's the best movie in the franchise. It stands alone as a great story, yet it contains enough connection back to the prior stories to satisfy those who have seen them. Great writing and effects. Very good acting.\n",
      "A masterful weaving of the old and new Don't let the shrill minority fool you, Star Wars The Force Awakens is one of the greatest films ever set in a galaxy far, far away.  J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan have accomplished what I thought to be impossible: they have resurrected the Star Wars franchise with more life and vigor than ever. From a beautiful story to crackling dialogue that doesn't take itself overly serious, this film is brimming with everything we ever loved about Star Wars.  The acting is better than we've ever seen it, with our returning cast, specifically Harrison Ford churning out their best performances yet. My favorite part of the film, however, are the new players. All of the young cast, specifically Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley stun in their respective roles.  This film plays as a love letter to fans, and while it's impossible to please everyone in the internet age, as a man who loved the original trilogy long before the prequels, I can assure you that if you consider yourself a real Star Wars fan, you will fall in love with this film.  I implore you to see it multiple times. It's gotten better every single time. It's now tied with Empire as my favorite Star Wars film. This film will stand the test of time for generations to come. Thank you J.J. and Kasdan for this gem of a trilogy kickoff!\n",
      "Feels More Canon Before I talk about the movie, I'd like to talk about canon-related material. A lot of times if we see sequels to a movie, or sometimes like Star Wars they do prequels. A lot of times even while those stories might fit in with the original story, there are slight inconsistencies and plot holes. A small example of that is in the first Home Alone Kevin is supposed to be 8, and in the second one which is supposed to take place a year later, he says he's 10. Now, going on with story lines even though this might be off topic, let me talk about another long series which I've grown up watching and it's DragonBall Z. People who watch that series knows that it consists of DragonBall, DragonBall Z, DragonBall G.T., movies as part of the series, and recently DragonBall Super in Japan. When we think of the series as a whole we probably think of DragonBall Z. DragonBall Z came out first in America, just like how Star Wars started with episodes 4-6 instead of 1-3. I read that the reason they started showing episodes of DragonBall Z in America before DragonBall is because they felt like the latter series would attract more viewers. With the success of DragonBall Z, they brought over DragonBall. Now, anybody who is a fan of the series knows there are inconsistencies from prior episodes that either seem forgotten or no longer cared about. A few examples is DragonBall is canon to DragonBall Z. DragonBall G.T. is non-canon and while some of us might consider it part of the original storyline, it wasn't quite as good and popular and even the writer of DragonBall, Toriyama doesn't consider it canon. Even in DragonBall there are things that seem forgotten, like Launch who is a main character in DragonBall and only in filler in DragonBall Z. The tails and giant apes/oozarus almost seem forgotten after the Saiyan Saga. Also, with the numerous power ups, we'd think the characters should easily destroy Earth by any move they make in the latter episodes. A few others is the Red Ribbon Army was portrayed differently in the Trunks, Androids, and Cell Saga than in DragonBall. Also after the Frieza Saga, it seemed harder to write new enemies over Frieza and power ups as in Season 4 there were numerous new enemies before finally ending with Cell. I'll conclude by saying there are various movies, while they take us to the series, most of them couldn't take place in the main storyline, even when the main storyline has inconsistencies. So, sorry to waste your time talking about DragonBall when this is for Star Wars. But, the point I'm making is Star Wars has 7 movies and episodes that came out. I've long since heard of a new Star Wars movie coming out, and originally heard they were planning on having it be a prequel, like Old Republic. Instead, they just wrote an Episode 7. With the 7 Star Wars movies that have come out, there have also been numerous Star Wars books that have come out, Star Wars video games, and Star Wars T.V. shows. With all those stories, fans of the movies might notice some inconsistencies with other stories and wonder if they're supposed to be Canon but they still take us to, \"A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far Far Away.\" Just like how the movies in DragonBall Z work even if they're not part of the main storyline. The reason I've brought this up, is because it makes sense to bring this up with such a big storyline. When we think of Star Wars, a lot of us probably think more of the characters from episodes 4-6 rather then 1-3. A lot of people are unhappy with the Star Wars prequels and notice inconsistencies. Some people even wonder if they should watch the Star Wars episodes in chronological order? I'll tell you, I've done that and episodes 1-3 will feel canon to each other, but not so canon to episodes 4-6.  This movie feels more canon to the later Star Wars episodes than the first trilogy will seem canon to the second, even though more time has probably passed from episodes 6 to 7 than episodes 3 to 4. While I was in the movie theater, as I actually saw this on a Disney cruise. The audience members clapped every time we saw characters and references to the original Star Wars movies, including a scene we saw in the trailer seeing Darth Vader's burnt mask. I went into the movie with low expectations feeling that this was going to be an overrated film that makes lots of money continuing the Star Wars series. I also saw lots of your complaints about this being like a rewrite of episode 4 with new characters. It's been a long time since I've seen episode 4, but I did not see it as a rewrite. It felt like more of it's original story. It had great action and was entertaining the whole way through, that I'd give it a 10. It seemed to be faster paced than a lot of the other Star Wars movies, and it's nice to see the characters from the Star Wars movies we remember most, played by the same actors over 30-years later. They still act like the way they did in the original movies. I haven't heard of an episode 8 in the works, but due to the success of this film and where the movie ended there should be an episode 8. So to briefly summarize what I wrote. I wrote this long review to explain how it feels more canon. I also mentioned how I went in with low expectations, but found this movie so entertaining that I'd definitely recommend it!! I'm excited for an episode 8 after seeing how good this movie was.\n",
      "Addressing the Haters: UNLEARN WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED OK I re-created my profile to address the haters. I loved this movie and was disheartened to come home to so many bad reviews. It seems most of the haters are dissatisfied because their demands weren't met and they somehow feel slighted. Haters: Honestly, one star? Two stars? Come on. I know you have some deep seated angst or whatever, but two stars? Saying Daisy Ridley was \"terrible\"? Now you're blowing your own credibility. We weren't even at the same movie. Like many, I grew up on the originals. J.J. Abrams had an impossible task: Heal a billion broken hearts from the prequels, show that he understands and cares about the franchise, scratch all those itches by incorporating all the old stories and characters, hand the torch to the new generation, and kick butt in a killer epic space adventure with heart",
      " And J.J. Abrams delivered. They all CRUSHED IT out of the park. I feel bad for those who can't see it. For those of us who could put down our list of demands, realize that we are NOT in charge and just take it in, this was an immensely entertaining film among the best of the canon. To address two main complaints: 1.) The \"remake\" factor and 2.) Rey/Daisy Ridley. 1.) The remake factor: A lot of thematic elements and concrete plot points followed the originals. But I can't imagine this was just an accident. No one noticed or cared enough? Screw it let's make a remake cause we don't feel like writing an original story? No way. Too much love and mastery went into every other aspect of the film – no way this was happenstance or laziness. I think part of it was a clear message to long-time fans: Not only are we going to DEMOLISH the prequels. We're going to revisit the originals and make THAT story better (which they did, BTW). Further, the \"quasi-reboot\" approach brings in the cyclical nature of the epic battle of good and evil – and this time it is intentional: Good is there, some evil Nazi-like force rises up to wreck everything. Then good has to rise up, underfunded, under-trained etc, to somehow defeat this evil force. Then it lies dormant for a while. Repeat. That's how it works throughout history, even a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. I think as the story progresses, we'll see this cyclical thing become part of the story. The original trilogy was just one turn in a wheel that keeps on spinning. Also, new characters emerge, starting on their own adventure, and it will look much the same as the adventures of their parents and grandparents. Just like my story doesn't look that different from my dad's or grandpa's. That's the circle of life. Don't blame J.J. Abrams for that. So, how did Rey whip Ren in that final light saber dual? 1.) The force fills in and helps as needed (as it did for Luke, who had no idea what he was doing throughout the original trilogy) and 2.) Ren is still a wimpy villain. He showed that from the start",
      " taking off his mask, worried that he doesn't have the potency of Vader, temper tantrums. He's a little boy. Emo-Vader. But then he kills his own dad, a scoundrel but not that bad a guy, reaching out to his son for reconciliation. Ren smokes right through him",
      " now that's some DARK matter. And he is just about to START completing his training, as is Rey. Those were amateurs in that final scene. She's no Jedi, but he's no Sith Lord, yet, either. This is just the beginning.  2.) Rey/Daisy Ridley. This was a strong woman character whose strength was primarily feminine. She wept at the weight of her calling, geek-ed out at meeting the mythical heroes of her youth, fought valiantly when needed. This character was the most well-drawn, complete female character I've ever seen in film.  Daisy Ridley: Astonishing – a revelation. I'm not a trained actor, but I know when an actor is doing it right: I was so enthralled and convinced by Ridley's performance – not for a second was she anything but Rey. All the actors were good and deserve props, but Ridley deserves the highest praise. She absolutely owned this role. This is the most FUN I have ever had seeing a movie in the theater. I was giddy. The scenery, cinematography, unbelievable performances by Ridley and others, charm, humor, action, scenery/cinematography – characters and story. Even the pacing was brilliant. The healing from the past pains washed over me and I was catapulted into a cool new adventure. Abrams, Ridley and anyone else involved: I hope you don't read this crap, but if you do, please note: here is one long-time fan saying THANK YOU! This was SO good, I was gee-king out the entire time. Giggling like a kid. I whispered \"No, please – don't do it\" to Kylo Ren on that bridge. I was absolutely LOST in a great star wars story. And isn't that the point?  If you can't get lost in this movie, maybe it's not J.J. Abrams' fault. Maybe you're just bringing too much baggage of your own. I think the team making this movie did everything humanly possible to help us get lost in the universe we love. Go again, pretend your 13, empty your head – UNLEARN WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED – and just soak it in, because this is really a great Star Wars movie. PEACE\n",
      "Wake up!!! The force truly has awakened! Any one who is even a casual fan of Star Wars will tell you that this movie is the very essence of what Star Wars stands for in all of its wondrous glory. The cast was very well selected, it's very clear that they selected the right people to populate the new generation of the universe, and that J.J. Abrams is, indeed, the man for the job. It really comes as no surprise that Abrams was able to do the series justice, but it was indeed refreshing to see to what extent.  The scenery was so amazing, and the new planets, while the terrain was not exactly original, Jakku was kind of a clone to Tatooine, but the village was vastly different to that of anything from the originals, or the prequels. If the fans will be very honest with themselves, these planets were refreshing in a very, very grim way.  Then there's the story, while it was not entirely original, it did bring about the necessary setting and development to help us along with our new characters and their full introductions, as well as a deeper look into their psyches. Not to mention a revisit from our main cast in the originals. Though it may seem a little forced (no pun intended), it did not hinder the story in any way, in fact much of it was very much needed. The film itself was gripping in every positive manner, and there were even some genuinely hysterical moments! It didn't need to dumb it down for children, as there is proof that even some of the younger kids liked, even loved this movie, and there were sounds of begging for their mothers to bring them back to see it again. Take that Jar Jar, you old HACK!  Now, let's get down to brass tax, was it good? Yes. Was it great? YES! Was it as good as the first one? Well, break my skull if you want, but YES YES YES it was actually just as good as the first trilogy, and that is coming from someone who grew up with the original trilogy on VHS. It was amazing. We are very fortunate to have the opportunity to see it in theaters, and own it on Blu-Ray, and we much NOT let that chance get away from us. So what are you doing still reading this review? GO SEE IT!!!!\n",
      "Excellent Sequel to an Outstanding Saga The Force Awakens is, as a whole, as great as we could have asked for in terms of a Star Wars movie. Thrilling throughout, the action itself is top class, while relationships, change and humor are explored naturally and brilliantly. The plot itself contains all it needs in terms of classic adrenaline filled moments and shocking twists, and even as the original saga is revisited a little too much in certain cases, the story moves forward at fitting pace nonetheless.  The only real confused and out of place feeling we experience is the detachment from the places we know well from the Star Wars galaxy. The positive side to Episodes 1,2 and 3 was the fact that we experienced the threat of the dark side from the center of the galaxy and the Senate that ran it. Here we follow the characters themselves without a real understanding of the state the galaxy is currently in. Star Wars needs a solid base on which to build, the base is the setting in which the story takes place, in this case the galaxy as a whole, in this new installment we are a little in the dark. The absence of a clear description of the current situation is compensated by the fact that we are constantly following the immediate situation however, close to the action, so it is not a concrete problem, just something the next step in the saga needs to include. Plot aside, the characters were what made the story great, and the chemistry between them. Finn is humorous and likable even as he is thrown back into the battle with the First Order he was trying to get away from. Rey is the perfect protagonist for Star Wars confronted with a complicated Sith no one has quite figured out yet, Kylo Ren. Poe Dameron is the guy everyone wants to be, portrayed outstandingly by Oscar Isaac, giving us a secondary hero inside the Resistance outside of the main characters. The old characters were not solely included for nostalgic reasons but served great purpose in the overall story, creating a perfect balance between old and new. Snoke provides an ultimate bad guy we know nothing about to keep us excited for the follow up. Finally our lovable droids excelled once again, BB-8 a welcome addition, one character that will become an image of the saga in years to come.  People will say there was too much old, others too much new, but in truth the balance was perfect, even as the balance of the force remains in that same state by the end of the movie, providing the next installment the liberty to take the saga any way it wants, while the world remains full of anticipation. Entering the cinema, be prepared to come out adrenaline-pumped and mind-blown, nothing can prepare you for the masterclass of a spectacle that awaits...\n",
      "Ignore negative, neckbeardy, contrarian reviews. The Force is strong with this awesome movie! This is a great movie. It's also an extremely popular and mainstream movie, and therefore is going to bring out raging nerds that will needlessly nitpick it to death in an attempt to look smart or edgy.  There are legitimate criticisms you can hurl at this or any movie, but people that give it a 1 or 2 out of 10 shouldn't be taken remotely seriously, as they are completely ignoring what the movie did right, and putting a magnifying glass over the irrelevant level of minor flaws included.  Normal Star Wars fans will find a lot to like hear. Great set pieces/locations, excellent costume design, flawed and relatable characters, hilarious banter/quips, dramatic and complex relationships, and a ton of space adventure fun! It's the best Star Wars film since Empire, hands down.\n",
      "The force has indeed awakened for Star Wars, and the haters continue to embarrass themselves. XD Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fabulous film and is a good dose of escapism from mundane everyday life, just like The Original Trilogy was. We can forget all our problems when seeing this movie. The Force Awakens sparks a joy for the child in all of us which many of us have been waiting for since The Empire strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. There couldn't have been a story more worthy of the subtitle 'Episode VII'. After the whole Trade Negotiations rubbish that plagued the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. J.J. Abrams reinvigorates the assaulted franchise and gives us some of the most powerful moments ever seen in the saga. Don't give in to the trolling of the prequel or original trilogy fanboys. They're just upset that somebody did a much stronger job than Lucas could have managed on his own. They couldn't tell a good movie apart from Transformers 3 &amp; 4, or any Michael Bay movie for that matter. We are entitled to our own opinion and mustn't succumb to these 'emotion vampires' that do their best and ultimately fail to make a difference in the end. The Force Awakens is a refreshingly fun film that as a form of escape in this day and age plagued by terrorism, cyber-terrorism, LGBT discrimination and racism. Star Wars is a welcoming series that isn't conformed by anything in our world ; it's a self-realising ecstasy that will always be there for us like an old friend.  10 stars\n",
      "What a great movie No matter of what, I love this film and anything Star Wars. Many people complain that the plot was a copy etc. but for me as a true SW fan, I just loved it, enjoyed it and always will. Don't get too critical, let yourself into that magical world and relax.. What the heck: Your review does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text. If I have said what I want in just few lines, isn't it enough?????? OK, Go and see the movie &lt;3 What else.....\n",
      "A welcome return to fun for the Star Wars saga! It took me two viewings to really decide how I felt about this one - having been a Star Wars fan since Empire, and having been so totally caught up in the year long hype for this, my first viewing was almost surreal. The second? It all came together and I had a great time. I'm not going to comment on whether or not this is a legitimately great movie, but I will say that I love it. I find it fun, action packed, intriguing and it absolutely satisfied my Star Wars itch and is (in my opinion) a worthy successor to the original trilogy. The new characters were lots of fun and I'm looking forward to seeing them develop - especially Rey! There were lots of moments that had me wanting to fist pump, several that had goosebumps rising on my arms and lots where I was grinning like a Cheshire cat - Poe and Finn's escape, the first flight of the Millennium Falcon, the attack on Takodana, the final battle between Kylo and Rey... Both me and my family enjoyed every second of this, with my 10 and 12 years old sons both being amazed at the running time because \"it felt like just an hour!\" This movie was everything I wanted from a new Star Wars film - it was familiar enough to be nostalgic, but new enough to be a continuation. It was mature enough to not fall into the trap of the prequels, but had enough humor to lighten scenes. It answered lots of questions and also raised some great new ones - leaving me wanting more. But, most of all, it's fun and like the Flash Gordon reels that George Lucas has stated inspired him to write Star Wars in the first place it was a rollocking adventure that didn't take itself too seriously and dished out exactly what the majority of the audience wanted - thrills, spills, laughs and action. Gone are the tedious politics, gone is the annoying slapstick and back is a full throttle space adventure. Awesome!\n",
      "Great movie, heavily recommend going and watching this movie! So despite my high rating and recommendation to go watch the movie, i want to take this time to express some slight concern for the future of the franchise and i believe the problem if any could be JJ Abrams. If any of you are familiar with the old star trek movies and JJ's last installment into darkness, there was defiantly a heavy draw from wrath of kahn. Same story here, episode 7 has many scenes that draw a parallel to episode 4 a new hope, and while its not bad it really feels like he might not have the ability to be original. Minor spoiler warning: If my suspicions are true Rey (aka ep 7's Luke skywalker parallel) will have a dramatic family tie reveal in episode 8 akin to finding out vader was lukes father.\n",
      "\"Force Awaken\" didn't make it. Poor story, just copied from 4th part. No one told me \"Force Awaken\" will be just remake of \"New Hope\". Story is almost the same but much more boring. Characters are boring too, really boring. From the very begging of movie I wish that director put them to death and replace with some real characters. And there is so little of interaction between those characters. Director simplified to much the story.  Movie has amazing battles, really amazing scenes, someone did good job. But without scenes and effects movie doesn't exists, is just empty shell. For me movie didn't make it. I thought that no one will make another part as bad as :The Phantom Menace\", but here is it \"Force Awaken\" Love 4th,5th and 6th, even 3rd is good, but this one didn't make it.\n",
      "Feminist garbage!! Han Solo always had problems running his ship which was a good laugh in the old Star Wars but she comes along and tells him what to do and fixes it even tho she never been in a ship in her whole life! She totally emasculated the only alpha male characters and one of the most popular star wars characters of all time. In the east, you never tell an older person or someone highly respect, what to do, it's the most disrespectful thing you can EVER do! Taking on a Kylo Ren who has trained his whole life in both light/dark force, she doesn't even get a scratch and destroys him in a 1 on 1 life-saber battle. Luke got owned in his first fight against Dark Vader and loses his arm while Anakin and Obi Wan couldn't beat Count Dooku even when Yoda turned up. This movie screams Feminists bullshit!!  This is the biggest movie in the world right now with a very strong feminist narrative. It certainly is a huge win for the feminazis because they know that things like these have the power to influence the minds of millions. Young men will be brainwashed into thinking they are worthless scum and girls will come out thinking they can do whatever they want because they are superior beings. And this, my friends, is how society gets ruined. There's already tweets from feminists celebrating the fact that the movie is exactly what they wanted. I simply refuse to go watch it and support this crap. I wouldn't be able to stomach it anyway\n",
      "A weak attempt to reboot Star Wars Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens sees young Rey (Ridley) meeting former stormtrooper Finn (Boyega), they find the Millennium Falcon and flee while pursued by the First Order. They find Han Solo (Ford) and join the Rebels in an effort to thwart the Order. Force Awakens had the potential to be the best Star Wars film since Empire if done right. Unfortunately it was placed in the hands of J.J. Abrams.\n",
      "It's nearly a copy of A New Hope. Even being bold enough to just use the exact same dialogue. Perhaps Abrams thought that was clever. But it wasn't, it makes the film feel cheap and lazy. The effects are bad, the performances are forgettable.\n",
      "The new characters are bad. Rey is dull, undeveloped and forgettable.\n",
      "Finn is annoying, pointless and he tries way to often to be funny but he's not.\n",
      "Kylo Ren is the worst villain yet, he's whiny, not at all threatening and just overall unlikable in every way.\n",
      "Actors like Isaac, Christie, Gleeson, Serkis and Nyongo are barely there and play completely undeveloped characters. So basically if you'd like to watch a CGI-filled undeveloped rip-off of A New Hope then have at it.\n",
      "But for people like me. We'll never understand how this crap has a spot IMDb's top 250 list.\n",
      "Not at all original!! SPOILER ALERT! The plot is EXACTLY the same as the fourth movie!! They're basically making a ton of money by redoing the 4th movie with different humor and better effects. Think about it, it's about an orphan in the dessert who runs into a droid with all this classified information about the Jedi. (Luke &amp; r2 vs Ray &amp; bb 8) Then they even both run into Han Solo and the millennium falcon! They both happen to have the force and is looking for someone to teach them how to use it. I mean come on, clearly they took Star Wars away from George Lucas and had no original content. They wanted to create more movies without screwing it up so they just copied the fourth movie. I'm so disappointed!!! I was actually really looking forward to this!!\n",
